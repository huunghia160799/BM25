brokerage firms must settle funds promptly but there 's no explicit definition for this in u.s. federal law see for example this article on settling trades in three days wikipedia also has a good write up on t+3 it is common practice however it takes approximately three days for the funds to be available to me in my canadian brokerage account that said the software itself prevents me from using funds which are not available and i 'm rather surprised yours does not you want to be careful not to be labelled a pattern day trader if that is not your intention others can better fill you in on the consequences of this i believe it will not apply to you unless you are using a margin account all but certainly the terms of service that you agreed to with this brokerage will specify the conditions under which they can lock you out of your account and when they can charge interest if they are selling your stock at times you have not authorised via explicit instruction or via a stop loss order you should file a complaint with the and with sufficient documentation you will need to ensure your cancel stop loss order actually went through though and the stock was sold anyway it could simply be that it takes a full business day to cancel such an order

here 's how this works in the united states there 's no law regarding your behavior in this matter and you have n't broken any laws but your broker dealer has a law that they must follow it 's documented here the issue is if you buy stock before your sell has settled before you 've received cash then you 're creating money where before none existed even though it is just for a day or two the government fears that this excess will cause undue speculation in the security markets the sec calls this practice because you 're spending money you have not yet received in summary your broker is not allowed to loan money to an account than is not set up for loans it must be a margin account people with margin account are able to day trade because they have the ability to use margin borrow money margin accounts are subject to pattern daytrading rules the rules are set forth by finra the financial industry reporting authority and are here

i recently needed to compute a better balance that let us pick and choose what to include in the computed sum without losing information so i this topic and i 'm pleased to say that i 've found a solution that works at least for our data you may have transactions that this code does n't recognize but you can always modify it to match my solution was written for ms sql server 2008 or later it uses a a view and a aggregate sum over order by which means it should be almost syntax compatible with mysql does not support over but you can perform a running sum using a variable with arithmetic addition directly in the select clause create a database table with this feel free to exclude columns you 're not interested in such as create a unique index on you could use it as a primary key i suppose you might be tempted to create a foreign key relationship between and however this will fail if you enforce it we have many transactions where points to a transaction that does n't exist this is usually in the case of type = web accept payment received and status = canceled we also have some values longer than 17 characters some start with all pending money requests i suspect this indicates the transaction is unfinished re download your entire paypal history csv files so that you have the latest retroactive updates import these csv files into this table do a simple test to see how bad paypal 's default data is to find out where the differences are coming from run this query the order by is to ensure consistent ordering when multiple transactions share the same timestamp as you scroll through the results you 'll see how the naive sum is thrown off from the official paypal computed balance column so as you can see the net column value can not always be trusted what we need is to generate our own value which is accurate that is the value is 0.00 for rows which do not affect the balance instead of being what they are right now the problem is given a single row of data such as any single row from the example table in my original question we have no way of inherently knowing what its is i have devised two functions to help solve this problem the first function only looks at the type and status column values and generates accurate values for the vast majority of rows indeed in our dataset we only had one row for which this approach did not work i recommend you try this one first and compare the running sum value to ensure it works for your data you can use this function in the query like so below hopefully it should give you an accurate running sum and balance figure at the end 8 and here 's the view that ties it all together used like so i hope this helps anyone else wanting to do accurate bookkeeping with paypal transaction history files

i work in analyzing economic development projects in the midwest like this and one of the most frustrating aspects of my job is when people try to distill and simplify complex financing structures for the sake of misleading others and furthering an agenda it 's not uncommon that i see small local blogs write articles saying something to the effect of major development project skips paying the taxes it rightfully owes completely disregarding the fact that in most cases the local government 's options are to either give the developer an incentive and make some additional money or offer nothing and watch the developer walk away from the table for a different site the next county over most governments given the choice would take lowered tax payments and more jobs over no tax payments and no jobs   since i was curious i decided to do a quick back of the envelope calculation of this project using a common economic impact model i used a conservative assumption of 3,000 new jobs the minimum foxconn expects to have by 2020 and well below the maximum capacity of the factory in the audio and video equipment manufacturing code of industry using the entire state of wisconsin as a geography this industry has average annual earnings in wisconsin of $ so i subtracted out $ 3,000 per job to make it in line with the article i also used the liberal assumption that 100 of these jobs will be considered net new or that they wo n't be replacing or destroying any existing jobs within the state    the results    salaries alone will amount to about $ 160 million per year assuming all workers receive the same salary of $ 53,000    indirect effects basically new jobs and spending for other industries used to support and maintain the factory that are n't directly employed by the factory itself will add an additional $ 20 million in earnings annually     finally induced effects the economic impact of new employees spending their salaries within the economy will add an additional $ 80 million    total change in jobs including factory workers maintenance and utility workers and new workers in supply chain industries is estimated as just north of 5,000    this adds up to $ 260 million in additional annual earnings within the wisconsin economy there is a lot more to be considered when looking at a project like this and there are a lot of ways wisconsin or foxconn can fuck this all up but it is n't out of the realm of possibility that attracting this new plant will end up being a worthwhile plan for wisconsin    also this quote   are calling this development he said speaking from the east room of the white house because we believe this will have a transformational effect on wisconsin just as silicon valley transformed the san francisco bay area   sounds like bullshit silicon valley is largely research and development not manufacturing saying that you 'll replicate the success of software engineers earning $ 120k a year by bringing in more $ 50k a year manufacturing jobs is misleading at best

a huge part of the problem is that low income people have been very heavily marketed to by the online and for profit colleges because they were eligible for financial aid mainly loans and were seen only as a straw through which to suck money out of the government by these schools because they were only interested in the money there was no attempt to qualify students in many of these schools or provide any support to them when students dropped out their counselors would keep signing them up for classes that they did n’t know about or attend    because a lot of the schools are bullshit schools with either no reputation or a poor one even those who finished were largely not able to get the high paying jobs they were promised in order to lure them in this goes for low income students especially ones whose families have no previous experience with post high school education across the board and all of this group is far more likely to default because they were basically ripped off got nothing useful from these bogus schools and were often outright defrauded and do not have the income they were told they would have when agreeing to the loans but because there is a higher percentage of minorities among this group they are more likely to be but our student loan system does n’t differentiate between loans for real and loans for these rip off schools so you are still 100 on the hook regardless even if they signed you up for several more worth of classes after you withdrew   it ’s a lot like the mortgage collapse desperate to keep making money the lenders targeted increasingly less qualified people who were also naive about the entire system and sold them terrible loans sometimes talking them out of more reasonable options and then when the whole thing starts to fail it ’s all because the government made the banks give mortgages to poor black people   the institutions suck up the money and leave bewildered poor people holding the bag now even poorer with nothing to show for the debt they will literally be digging out of forever    the obama administration finally took some steps to control the predatory for profit institutions and try to sort out who had been ripped off vs people who had genuinely received any useful education but of course the new sec of education is doing her best to roll all that back   and most of the victims are n’t teens either they are adults with kids who were trying to do something to better themselves and their lives and got screwed over some of these middle aged people will literally be having their social security garnished to pay for these loans it ’s disgusting and even more so to say it ’s all affirmative action

when you say that the problem is high supply but no demand you are actually correct here 's why   the phrase borrow spend less save more is n't an absolute law it 's more of a cautionary tale obviously spending is an integral part of an economy it accounts for at least 50 of every transaction but the is getting at something other than people to not spend the point of the saying is that interest rates should reflect savings rates    what it comes down to is the how the law of supply and demand applies to the relationship between savings and interest rates consider this thought experiment in a world where everybody saves 50 of their income what would happen to interest rates banks would have a glut of savings relative to the population assuming demand remains constant interest rates would go down the price of borrowing goes down as the supply of money to be borrowed increases thus a corollary of the law of supply and demand is that as savings increase interest rates tend to go down    so as savings increase the economic environment encourages capital improvements businesses can borrow at lower rates and increase long term productive capacity this is what the federal reserve has attempted to do by lowering the fed funds rate to near zero and by operation twist increase economic activity through low borrowing costs    so what 's the problem when interest rates are artificially low there are no savings to support the production later in time a company that borrows at a 1 rate created by the feds can build a factory to make widgets but it will have a hard time selling that widget to a population with a negative net worth however if the 1 rate is natural then the company should be fine the savings of the population should support the production from his widget factory    for about 30 years we have experienced a credit boom in this country that was not created by excess savings this trend could n't continue forever look around you at the end of the day an economy is simply a group of people getting together to buy and sell stuff and services right now there is a lot of debt and little cash who will be doing the buying

for the first and last questions i can do this multiple ways   for the middle question i 'll just make up values   if you want different ones you will have to redo the math    i am going to assume that you participate in the merger exchange swapping your share for their offer    if you own one share it depends how they handle fractional shares   your original one share of abc can be worth either one share of xyz or 1.05 shares of xyz   if you get one share you typically get an additional $ cash to make up for the fractional share    you might ask why you do n't just get $ 20 cash and one share of xyz   consider the case where you own twenty shares of abc   then you 'd own twenty one shares of xyz and $   no need for fractional shares    beyond all this though the share value of xyz is not set   the shares might be worth $ 16 $ 40 or $ 2 after the merger   if both stocks are perfectly valued and the market is aware of that value then it will depend partially on the number of shares of each    for example if we assume there are 10,000 shares of abc and 50,000 shares of xyz including the shares paid for abc then their initial market values are $ 320,000 for abc and $ 800,000 for xyz   xyz is paying $ so its value drops to $   but it is gaining abc which is worth $ 320,000   net value now is $ or $ per share    this has assumed that the shares transferred from xyz to the shareholders of abc were already included in the market value   this may mean that the stock price was previously $ 20 or so with almost 40,000 shares in circulation   then they issued new shares diluting the value down to $ 16   we could start at 50,000 shares at $ 16 and end up with 60,000 to shares at $ to $ per share   then xyz is really only paying $ for abc   that 's a premium of only $ for abc and gives a final stock value of $ per share    the problem though is that in reality there is no equivalent of perfect value   so i say again that the market value might be $ the answer that best fits the question given the example quantities of shares $ 13 $ 20 or something else   it will depend on how the market perceives the deal   is the combined company worth more or less than the sum of its parts    and beyond this you will have $ 19.20 to $ 20 in cash in addition to your xyz share or 1.05 shares   assuming 1.05 shares that would be $ plus the $ 19.20 's $ total in theory or anything from $ 19.20 up in practice   with the the only thing of which you can be sure is the $ 19.20 cash   the value of the stock is up in the air    if xyz is only privately traded this is still true   the stock is worth the price that someone will pay for it   the someone is just more limited with privately traded stocks

the pure numbers answer says you want the refund to be close to $ 0   you can even argue as some answers have that you want to try to maximize the payment without receiving any sanctions for underpaying during the year if you trace the money it 's easy to see why   let 's say you get a paycheck   tag some of the dollars for uncle sam   these are the dollars that eventually will be given to the irs   now consider the following scenarios from the raw numbers like this its clear that you lose utility by setting yourself up for a large refund check   the money was yours the entire time but you chose to give it to uncle sam instead however the raw numbers are only part of the puzzle   if you 're a cold numbers person they 're the part that matters   when the are playing their tax evasion games this is the only thing they are paying attention to   however real humans have a few psychological reasons they may choose to lose utility in terms of raw dollars in exchange for psychological assistance these attitudes exist and may be ideal for any one person   obviously the financially savvy answer of minimize your refund is the ideal answer from a dollars and cents perspective but its up to you to see whether that attitude is right when you account for all of the non measurable things like stress   in general i would lead anyone to minimize your refund but i would be if i did n't include the very real psychological reasons people choose to deviate from it

institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral meaning that for every options contract they buy or write they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset this as a theory is called max pain which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors this as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors the is that many times a stock gets to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days like or by closing bell at options expiration dates many options contracts are being closed and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades to keep liquidity so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset to remain delta neutral when the contract closes or get rid of the option they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset at mass volume of options traded this would cause noticeable downward pressure similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought the result is a stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest this tends to happen in more liquid stocks than less liquid ones to answer that question as they have more options series and more strike prices no this would not be illegal in the us attempting to mark the close is supposedly prohibited but this would n't count as it the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the sec 's current enforcement regime although an active area of research

it 's because they 're used to it and it works for them   everything other reason is meh used to you could float a check to payday have no money in the account yet write a check a couple days before payday because you know that 's how long it takes for the check to get to your bank and when it does you 'll have the money    but most if not all business that still accept checks a dying subset for sure electronically present the check now   they take it from your hand run it through a machine at the register and it immediately clears the bank just like a debit card would    we 're nearing the end of the check era atleast on personal accounts   kids growing up now wo n't even know what a check is aside from it 's on a type of bank account

a few years ago there was a tv special with a celebrity chef i think tyler that was trying to get a small town to eat healthier in one segment he showed kids how processed chicken nuggets were made which was some chicken trimmings and the leftover bones and all mixed with bread crumbs and strained and this was supposedly supposed to be disgusting especially to kids did n't work they still wanted chicken nuggets   in the end there 's nothing wrong with using the gross parts of an animal nor is there any thing wrong with some of the processing techniques mostly they 're used to get the most out of the animal which is what we should be doing americans especially are incredibly turned off by any meat that is n't pure white which is ridiculous dark meat and are used around the world and are seen as chemicals are used to scare people but there 's nothing inherently wrong with them heck cooking developed as a way to find more interesting uses for chemicals and additives   you 'll find no bigger supporter of home cooking and eating whole foods than i am but there is way too much fear mongering and that 's based only on arbitrary perceptions of what 's acceptable and what is n't you could probable start a campaign of outrage against tortillas for using lime or bacon for using nitrites or fish for being frozen all because people are gullible and ignorant on where their food comes from

i work as an investment risk manager for what would be called a top tier investment manager most large asset managers use vendor models like barclays point or something similar and use those to calculate endless varieties of analytics and risk metrics    some of these are granular risk models single asset based and computing between them while others are factor models e.g. mapping bonds to a yield curve and sector and country spread and computing the risk largely based on that mapping things like value at risk in any of its many flavors simulated vs non simulated mainly ex ante risk relative to a benchmark stress tests duration beta yield spread expected shortfall what have you    counterparty credit risk is a whole different world i could get into what else do you want to know in detail

as a 22 year old planning for your financial life it is obvious to say that saving as much as you can to invest for the long run is the smartest thing to do from a financial point of view   in general at this point aged 22 you can take as much risk as you 'll ever will you 're investing for the very long term + years the downside of risk the level of uncertainty on returns positive or negative is most significant on the short term < while the upside of risk assuming you can expect higher returns the more risk you take are most significant on the long term   in short for you 're financial life it 's smart to save as much as you can and invest these savings with a lot of risk   so what is smart to invest in the most important rule is to keep your investment costs as low as possible risk and returns are strongly related however investment costs lower the returns while you keep the risk be aware of the investment industry marketing fancy investment products most of them leave you with higher costs and lower returns research strongly suggests that an etf portfolio is our best choice personally i disregard this new smart beta hype as a marketing effort from the financial industry they charge more investment costs that 's a certain and promise better returns because they are geniuses hmmm no thanks as suggested in other comments i would go for an low cost you should n't pay more than 0.2 per year etf portfolio with a global diversification with at least 90 in stocks actually that is what i 've been doing for three years now i 'm 27 years old

here 's how capital gains are totaled long and short term capital gains and losses are either long term or    short term it depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property if    the taxpayer holds it for one year or less the gain or loss is    short term net capital gain   if a taxpayer ’s long term gains are more than their    long term losses the difference between the two is a net long term    capital gain if the net long term capital gain is more than the net    short term capital loss the taxpayer has a net capital gain so your net long term gains from all investments through all brokers are offset by any net short term loss   short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate i 'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain but at the same time trade the stock if you close in the next year one of two things will happen either the stock will go down and you 'll have short term gains on the short or the stock will go up and you 'll have short term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock   so i don;t see how it reduces your tax liability   at best it defers it

i can see apprenticeships making a comeback   i know of very few apprenticeships these days i 'm guessing most of them were replaced way back with certifications   the most obvious one is tattoo artists    to actually work at a tattoo place of business not a house basement you must serve for a year under someone who is a legitimate experienced tattoo artist   you will make half of what the tattoo is priced and the person getting the tattoo is well informed of who is doing the tattoo sometimes they get a discount because of it    after a year you are certified and can begin working by yourself and setting your own rates with a portion going to the business you usually rent a room in a tattoo shop    i 'm sure these standards vary depending on where you are but with economics turning the way they are i think apprenticeships can cover some of the downturn we are experiencing i 'm not sure how much it would cover but it would cover something however small   it also weeds out any who are n't serious and might otherwise produce terrible results

if they had told me that i owe them $ 10,000 from 3 years ago i    would n't have anything to fight back why first thing you have to do is ask for a proof have you received treatment have you signed the bill when you were done this should include all the information about what you got and how much you agreed to pay do they have that to show to you with your signature on it if they do n't you owe nothing if they do you can match your bank credit card insurance records those are kept for 7 years at least and see what has been paid already can a doctor 's office do that they can do whatever they want the right question is whether a doctor 's office is allowed to do that check your local laws states regulate the medical profession is there a statute of limitation i 'm just guessing that forces them    to notify me in a certain time frame statute of limitations limits their ability to sue you successfully they can always sue you but if the statute of limitations has passed the court will throw the suite away provided you bring this defense up on time of course without a judgement they can not force you to pay them they can only ask nicely as the law quoted by mrchrister mandates they can trash your credit report and send the bill to collections though but if the statute of limitations has passed i doubt they 'd do that especially if its their fault i 'm not a lawyer and you should consult with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction for definitive answers and legal advice

how would this trade behave irl i do n't know how the simulation handles limit orders and bid ask spreads to know it 's feasible but buying at when the current ask is 8.00 seems unlikely   that would mean that all other sell orders between 8.00 and were fulfilled which means that there were very few sellers or that sell pressure spiked both of which seem unlikely in reality it seems more likely that your order would have sat there until the ask dropped to $ if it ever did and then you 'd have to wait until the bid rose to $ in order to sell them at that price however that kind of swing in option prices in not unrealistic   options near at the money tend to move in price at about 50 of the change in the underlying so if amazon suddenly dropped by $ 5 the option price could drop by $ from to $ and then rise back to $ if the price rose $ 8 which would be 1 swing and not unheard of intra day but it sounds like you got very lucky or the simulation does n't handle option trading realistically i 've traded options in the past and have had some breaks similar to yours   i 've also had bad breaks where i lost my entire investment the options expire out of the money so it should be a very limited part of your portfolio and probably only used for risk management e.g. buying put options to lock in some gains but keeping some upside potential

on the other hand i 'd be contributing less than with a traditional    plan since it is taxed before being invested you got it backwards the effective limit is higher for a roth 401k than a traditional 401k the nominal limit is the same $ but an amount of money in a roth plan is equivalent to a greater amount of money in a traditional plan because money in a traditional plan is pre tax that will need to be taxed when taken out resulting in less post tax money conversely for a roth plan that is post tax money which came from a greater amount of pre tax money and it wo n't be taxed again so it is more money tax neutral comparison wise of course since you say that you wo n't hit the limit this consideration does n't matter anyway

if you 're making $ 80k and you 're consulting for an extra $ or $ you 're earning a total of $   that 's assuming you do it for a full calendar year of course   either way assuming you can deduct exclude at least $ 11k of income as almost everyone can you 're paying 25 on your marginal dollars   this also assumes you 're single if you 're married filing jointly this may not be true   note you 're right at the edge of the 25 bracket if you earn this in a full calendar year but if you have a 401k health insurance or other reductions you 'll be fine   additionally for this year you 'll be under again assuming single and no other income because you are n't earning a full year 's worth assuming your $ 80k is precisely taken care of by your regular withholding then you will literally pay in additional taxes $ 100 per week   so if you are paid biweekly you need to add $ in withholding on your w-4   if you expect to overpay taxes if you own a house with a mortgage for example you often do you can reduce it some but adding $ paycheck should bring you right to where you were before the extra income the general rule is to calculate your marginal not effective tax rate before the new income assuming default withholding takes care of that and then withhold the marginal rate for the new income checking that the new income does n't push the marginal rate up if so calculate in two parts the part in the lower marginal rate and the part in the higher marginal rate you can google 2014 tax brackets or look at the irs tax tables for detailed information about marginal rates

why is the stock trading at only $ 5 per share the share price is the perceived value of the company by people buying and selling the stock not the actual value of the company and all its assets generally if the company is not doing well there is a perceived risk that it will burn out the money fast there is a difference between its signed conditional sale and will get money and has got money so in short it 's trading at $ 5 a share because the market does n't feel like it 's worth $ 12 per share quite a few believe there could be issues faced i.e. it may not make the $ 12 or there will be additional obligations i.e. employees may demand more layoff compensation etc or the distribution may take few years due to regulatory and legal hurdles the only problem is the stock exchange states if the company has no core business the stock will be suspended soon hopefully they can release the $ 12 per share first what will happen if i hold shares in the company the stock gets suspended and its sitting on $ 12 per share can it still distribute it out every country and stock markets have laid out procedures for de listing a company and closing a company the company can give $ 10 as say dividends and remaining later or as part of the closure process the company will distribute the balance among shareholders this would be a long drawn process

you have 2 concerns the lender and the irs either way you should be fine the lender just wants to know that you have no legal claim to the property or other compensation simply signing a gift declaration should clear that up making this a gift from their perspective   they probably have some standard form you can sign otherwise just a simple note that says i so and so gave er name x$ on the y of june 20 as a gift with no expectation of repayment   then only way you could get charged with fraud is if you seek compensation for this gift in the future   even then the bank would probably have to find out about the compensation and complain pretty strongly to get a prosecutor interested in a small dollar misrepresentation case with little or no provable intent a bigger concern is the bank being uncomfortable with the future renter also giving a gift that just smells weird and bankers hate anything weird it probably wo n't prevent the mortgage from getting approved but it might delay the underwriters a few days while the wring their hands about it the irs is a bit more complicated they tend to be the heads we win tails you lose types   assuming they consider this a gift then you are fine since it is under the annual gift exclusion these days you do n't even have to tell them about it   however if she gives you a large financial gift in the near future they may decide to interpret those two events as a single transaction turning this into a no interest loan even then you should be fine since the irs generally does n't care about loans under with missing interest under since this is a small loan and interest rates are so low you have no worries further irs reading on gift loans

in the us the best way to solve the problem imho would be via a trust talk to a properly licensed trust estate attorney and a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state using intermediary who 's not a organization may pose income tax issues to that intermediary as providing support to the needy is not a valid business expense it may also pose gift tax issues since the aggregate amounts may exceed the statutory exemption limits using a non trust you can avoid these issues but others may come up such as what to do with the trust income or moneys talk to the advisers about how to avoid them

traditionally dealers and broker dealers were in contact with the actual producers of a product or issuers of a security selling it at the exchange on their behalf   consumers would traditionally be on the buy side of course these days anyone can enter the market on either side   even if you do n't hold the security or product you could sell it and take on the risk of having to stock up on it by the delivery date in exchange for cash or other securities   on the other side if you ca n't hold the product or security you could still buy it taking on the risk of having to dispose of it somehow by delivery in exchange for cash or other securities in either case you the sell side take on risk and provide products securities cash   this is most commonly known as market making   modern literature coins the terms liquidity taker buy side and liquidity provider sell side   even more accurately risk management literature would use the terms risk taker sell side and risk or risk buy side this is quite illustrative in modern abstract markets   take a market that allows for no offsetting or hedging because the product in question is abstract or theoretical e.g. weather trading volatility trading inflation trading etc   there 's always one party trying to eliminate dependence on or correlation to the product the risk buy side and the counterparty taking on their risk sell side

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

the deposit insurance is n't provided by the bank it 's provided by the singapore deposit insurance corporation sdic in the event that the bank fails or is declared insolvent the sdic will pay deposit holders their total balance in all accounts with that bank up to s$50,000 if you hold in all of your insured accounts you 'll only receive s$50,000 if the bank fails   the sdic provides an example page with sample calculations and this is exactly what they show if you deposit an amount greater than $ it 's only insured up to s$50,000   so does it mean one should open multiple accounts under different banks to spread the money around and maintain only s$50,000 in one deposit account this is one option the calculations page i linked to above gives this reminder deposits are not insured separately in each branch office of a di scheme member i.e. all your eligible accounts maintained with different branches of a di scheme member are aggregated and insured up to s$50,000 this seems like common sense but it 's important to remember that if you open an account with two branch offices of bank a your deposits are aggregated and insured up to s$50,000 the sdic insurance is per institution called a deposit insurance member not per branch if you hold in each branch office for a total of you 're still only insured up to s$50,000 for that bank if you want to spread out your accounts between multiple banks make sure they 're different banks not just different branches another option if it applies to you is to open a joint account with your spouse in the faq page the sdic gives this example under point 14 if you and your husband have a joint account with and you have a separate account of your total deposits of will be covered to the maximum of s$50,000 the deposit of $ is split evenly between the spouses so in the eyes of the sdic each are holding then the husband 's additional is added to for a total of s$50,000 this is then insured up to s$50,000 as usual   i 'm sure there are other options specific to singapore that i 'm not aware of if you 're well above the limit i.e. holding millions of dollars i 'm sure a professional accountant in singapore could guide you further

what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day    in the far future you 've informed them of the error and they 've informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them so you have a couple of issues have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points the first is your legal responsibility otherwise you 're stealing and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient i ca n't tell you that maybe you should send them a letter maybe you should wait until you 've had written confirmation from them maybe you 're ok as you are you might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues here in the uk you could ask citizen 's advice the second is beyond your ability to know for sure but it 's not dishonest to work on the basis that what the company 's proper representative tells you is true with the usual caveats that i 'm not qualified to give legal advice once told you 've been clearly told that it 's an intentional gift i do n't see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it the worst case far future problem i would expect is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place in other words the company made two separate errors first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand in that case you might have to pay them back whatever you 've spent on the card beyond the points you 're entitled to to avoid this you 'd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction so that you can say no the point balance was not erroneous and here 's the legal reason why and pay them nothing you might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift and of course before paying tax on it if that 's necessary you 'd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours if that written confirmation is n't forthcoming then so be it they 've the gift and i doubt you 're inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right   that 's potentially fraud or theft if you lie you did notice and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call so never say you did n't notice if you had n't called them yet then you 've been given something in error and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are so if you had n't already called them i would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customer 's favour are final otherwise you 're in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising and you deciding to keep it without telling them my guess is that 's unlikely to be a legally binding gift and might legally be theft or fraud on your part

whether or not paypal itself reports to the credit bureaus the collector   that said you can demand the collector validate the debt which if you were scammed could make for an interesting scenario paypal does n't normally play the role of a creditor so the very fact that you owe them money is an unusual situation in and of itself   i 'm not entirely sure how they would go about validating that debt they have n't provided you any goods or services you do n't have any form of loan outstanding with them the legitimacy of the debt consists entirely of them siding with the other party in a he said she said dispute   i 'd be interested to hear what the collector replies with when you demand validation of the debt

one overarching thing to keep in mind is that wherever you go with finance if you work hard enough and climb the ladder you can make decent money i know cio 's market and even cfo 's portfolio managers and cpa 's that all live extremely comfortably and all of them work outside of the ib industry basically ib is n't the end all for making large sums of money the main reason why it pays so much upfront is that of the hours you have to work if you look at their salary at an hourly rate it 's around 10 12 bucks an hour    definitely think about the double major thing though or potentially just doing a minor it would definitely look good on a resume especially if it 's something you also enjoy but you 've got ta keep that gpa high and getting a 4.0 in cs is quite a challenge to begin with   pretty much any of the series certifications can help you depending on where you want to go career wise obviously for some positions have certain series certifications wo n't be useful at all it 's also worth looking into the cfa program if you plan on doing financial analysis but you 'll need a sponsor for this just like the series certifications   happy to help man if you 've got any other questions feel free to reach out i 'm in the same boat just trying to figure out what i want to do with my life to make decent money so i can take care of my friends and family and live life to the fullest

i see a couple of ways of getting at this   one would be to switch to a vat   that would capture a good amount of revenue on anything that 's made here   second i want ip to be taxed   we pay property taxes so i think that trademarks and copyrighted works should be taxed just like how real property is taxed   you want to register the burger king logo in the us   sure thing   you will pay a percentage of its value every year and you get to use it exclusively with the full protection of the us courts your taxes help fund   i also see this as a good way out of the ip we 're currently in   copyright has become unreasonably long mostly because disney does n't want to lose the rights to mickey mouse   look i am sympathetic to disney 's argument   mickey genuinely is important to them   but mickey is fucking things up for everyone else   so i think disney should pay a percentage of mickey 's value every year   in exchange they keep their copyright forever as long as they keep paying   now if the copyright tax is n't paid then the property becomes public domain forever   this would let disney have what they want while non profitable copyrights become public domain as they should   anyhow the one thing all the big tax avoiding companies have in common is ip   if you tax their ip in exchange for protection in us courts there 's really no way around that   they will either have to pay or let their ip go public domain

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

largely because stock markets are efficient markets at least mostly if not entirely while the efficient market hypothesis is not necessarily 100 correct for the majority of traders it 's unlikely that you could on the long term find significant market inefficiencies with the tools available to an individual of normal wealth say < $ 500k that 's what frequent trading intends to do find market inefficiencies   if the market is efficient then a stock is priced exactly at what it should be worth based on risk and future returns   if it is inefficient then you can make more money trading on that inefficiency versus simply holding it long   but in stating that a stock is inefficient you are stating that you know something the rest of the market does n't or some condition is different for you than the other million or so people in the market   that 's including a lot of folks who do this for a living and have very expensive modelling software and hardware to run it on   i like to think that i 'm smarter than the far majority of people but i 'm probably not the smartest guy in the room and i certainly do n't have that kind of equipment especially with high frequency trading nowadays as such it 's certainly possible to make a bit of money as a trader versus as a long term investor but on the whole it 's similar to playing poker for a living   if you 're smarter than most of the people in the room you might be able to make a bit of money but the overhead in the case of poker the money the house charges for the game in the case of stocks the exchange fees and broker commissions means that it 's a losing game for the group as a whole and not very many people can actually make money   add to that the computer based trading so imagine a poker game where four of the eight players are computer models that are really good and actively maintained by very smart traders and you can see where it gets to be very difficult to trade at a profit versus long term investments which take advantage of the growth in value in the company finally the risk because of leverage and option trading which is necessary to really take advantage of inefficiencies makes it not only hard to make a profit but easy to lose everything   again to the poker analogy the guys i 've known playing poker for a living do it by playing 10 20 games at once because one game is n't efficient enough you would n't make enough money   in poker you can do that fairly safely especially in limit games but in the market if you 're leveraging your money you risk losing a lot   every action you take to make it safer removes some of your profit

form w-9 officially the request for taxpayer identification number and certification is used in the united states income tax system by a third party who must file an information return with the internal revenue service irs it requests the name address and taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer in the form of a social security number or employer identification number a w-9 is typically required when an individual is doing work as a contractor or as an employee for a company and will be paid more than $ 600 in a tax year   the company is required to file a w-2 or a 1099 and so requests a w-9 to get the information necessary for those forms i can not say if it is incompetence on the part of the accounting department or a deliberate ploy to make the refund process more onerous but do not comply   politely on a refund without any further information   if the company refuses request a charge back from the credit card company file a complaint with the consumer protection department of the state where the company is located and write a bad review on yelp or wherever else seems appropriate

it is really hard to tell where you should withdraw money from so instead i 'll give you some pointers to make it easier for you to make the decision for yourself while keeping the answer useful to others as well i have 3 401ks and some has post tax non roth money why keeping 3 401ks you can roll them over into an ira or the one 401k which is still active i assume here you 're not currently employed with 3 different employers this will also help you avoiding fees for too low balances on your iras however for the 401k with after tax not roth balance read the next part carefully post tax amounts are your basis generally it is not a good idea to keep post tax amounts in 401k ira you usually do post tax contributions to convert them to roth asap withdrawing from 401k with basis may become a mess since you 'll have to account for the basis portion of each withdrawal especially if you pool it with iras so that one do n't rollover keep it separately to make that accounting easier i also have several smaller iras and roth iras keep in mind the rmd requirements roth iras do n't have those and are non taxable income so you would probably want to keep them as long as possible this is relevant for 401k as well again consolidating will help you with the fees i 'm concerned about having easily accessible cash for emergencies i suggest keeping roth amounts for this purpose as they 're easily accessible and bear no taxable consequence other than emergencies do n't touch them for as long as you can i do have some other money in taxable investments for those consider re balancing to a more conservative style but beware of the capital gains taxes if you have a lot of gains accumulated you may want consider loss harvesting selling the positions in the red to liquidate investments without adverse tax consequences while getting some of your cash back into the checking account in any case depending on your tax bracket capital gains taxes are generally lower down to 0 than ordinary income taxes which is what you pay for ira/401k withdrawals so you would probably want to start with these after careful planning and taking the rmd and the social security if you 're getting any into account

this is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point   first google and others essentially have in house investment banking departments that are vetting valuing negotiating and sealing these deals these m&amp;a guys are mostly former bankers    so while they may not be using investment banks they are certainly using bankers google has $ in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year it 's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in house    second certain tech companies like google and facebook and zynga have unique corporate structures where the ceo founders retain majority voting control of their companies    this means guys like zuckerberg page brin et al control over 50 of all voting shares and they can not be ousted by the board of directors nor can they be on any matter via a proxy battle this gives these founders far reaching control over m&amp;a and thus you see deals like the $ cash + stock whatsapp acquisition and instagram both of these deals were reportedly driven by zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals but determined the price    most ceos do not have this kind of latitude    third within silicon valley the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other the ceos founders vcs etc they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire   it 's not like zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out snapchat

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

it 's a serious problem for traditional cinema while i personally really enjoyed some recent films less critically like ghost in the shell 's remake and more widely well received films like it and blade runner the industry is clearly in a slump numbers wise   with netflix amazon hulu youtube and of course it is harder to get as many people to the cinemas consistently    it 's a bit sad at the surface it would seem that if a series of really quality however imperfect fall blockbuster films like it and and can not sufficiently act as a for the industry it 's not the type quality of movies that are the only problem    we 're still getting plenty of action movies superhero movies disney family movies war movies classic and but people are choosing to go less     for the foreseeable future this is the new normal   fewer people are to movie theatres and the ones that do will go less often   cinema and film companies are going to need to work within a model where a film opens to less people and will still be able to make money on the back end with digital online release   i think there will always be a niche for people who want to see a movie when it 's new on the big screen so in the long run i think the more premium cinemas like with the more premium experience with stylish contemporary theaters with comfortable seats food alcohol etc will still get people in the door   amc and will need to adapt to this model too and in some major cities already are trying amc might be having slightly more success at this so far but we 'll see   the industry will probably need to begin to operate more like a niche premium product in order to survive

in united states vs. wiki the supreme court established the precedent of interpreting sec rule using the theory the theory establishes that   gt confidential information for securities trading purposes in breach of a duty owed to the source of that information gives rise to a duty to disclose or abstain    you 're correct that from a legal perspective the rules are anything but clear outside of company insiders however your own admission is consistent with what anyone in the securities industry knows is true if you trade on material non public information you risk being charged   i think most would conclude that it 's unethical irrespective of the letter of the law it damages the integrity and functioning of markets furthermore if the law was clarified i think it 's highly unlikely it would state trading on material non public information is permissible for anyone who is not a company insider instead i would expect it to be consistent with trading on material non public information is illegal if in doubt abstain and this is exactly what the government officials should be doing

banks ca n't simply make loans in the void this is how the cash flow works generally   1 add cash into the bank the bank now has cash 10 of that cash is held on reserve per law this cash is held on the balance sheet as an asset cash and a liability demand deposits    2 someone requests a loan the loan is funded from the non reserved cash of these deposits this results in a lessening of an asset cash and the creation of a new asset loan   3 traditionally as the debtor pays back the loan the interest is distributed in some sort of split between the bank and the depositors this means cash in from the loan and interest and a liability deposits also go up   4 alternatively while the above still happens the bank can securitize the loan and sell that to investors investors then get access to the loan and its income and the bank collects a fee however this means more cash on hand for the bank to originate additional loans without going near the reserve requirement    if a bank extends too many loans and its reserve is threatened it must borrow either from the fed or from other banks these loans must be paid back

i disagree if nobody got their health insurance through their employer then everyone would go out on the market and acquire them this would create a more dynamic health insurance market which would over time drive down the cost of getting health insurance    i do n't follow your logic about how wages would n't keep up 10 or 20 years down the road if anything not having to worry about benefits in a particular job would give employees more job mobility causing the job market to be more competitive in other words it would be more likely to cause wages to up   also ancillary benefits of getting employers out of the health insurance benefit dynamic would be to create more efficiencies within those businesses reduce staff spent on coordinating plans and such make small businesses more competitive they are at a disadvantage now with regard to big companies with pools of employees and get more people to acquire at least some form of insurance health coverage goes up   i for one welcome a world in which our employers have absolutely nothing to do with our benefits choices and we choose them at our own discretion just as i do with my car insurance

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

the two things are materially different point number 1   with a credit card the bank and card network earn a fee every time you spend on your card   you swipe a $ 100 dinner the credit card company makes about $ 3   you pay it back they may not make any interest but they 've made their $ 3   additionally if you have a $ 1,000,000 credit limit you 've only actually borrowed $ 100 which brings me to point number 2    point number 2   a credit limit of $ x is not in any way the same as a loan for $ x.   when you seek a personal loan the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan less any origination fees that may apply   your loan for $ 8,000 results in $ 8,000 being wired to your account   your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something   until then its a simple adjustable risk limit set by the bank 's underwriters point number 3   your credit report contains no income information   it 's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they 're willing to take   some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information   some lenders want to see some pay stubs   some lenders will lend $ x on stated income but wo n't lend $ x+1 without income verification   some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment   it 's all lender specific   credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2 point number 4   if you 're getting a loan for your required mortgage down payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize

i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes

the buying service your credit union uses is similar to the one my credit union uses i have used their service several times there is no direct cost to use the service though the credit union as a whole might have a fee to join the service i have used it 4 times over the decades if you know what make and model you want to purchase or at least have it narrowed down to just a few choices you can get an exact price for that make model and options you do this before negotiating a price you are then issued a certificate you have to go to a specific salesman at a specific dealership but near a large city there will be several dealers to pick from   there is no negotiating at the dealership you still have to deal with a trade in and the financing option dealer credit union or cash but it is nice to not have to negotiate on the price of course there is nobody to stop you from using the price from the buying service as a goal when visiting a more conveniently located dealership that is what i did last time the first couple of times i used the standard credit union financing and the last time i did n't need a loan even if you do n't use the buying service one way to pay for the car is to get the loan from the credit union but get the rebate from the dealer many times if you get the low dealer financing you ca n't get the rebate doing it this way actually saves money speaking of rebates see how the buying service addresses them the big national rebates   were still honored during at least one of my purchases so it turned out to be the buying service price minus $ 1,000 if your service worked like my experience the cost to you was a little time to get the price and a little time in a different dealer to verify that the price was good

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

the first and most important thing to consider is that this is a business transaction and needs to be treated as such nail down absolutely all the details specifically including what happens if either of you decides it 's time to move and wants to sell off your share of the property get at least one lawyer involved in drawing up that contract perhaps two so there 's no risk of conflict of interest what 's your recourse or his if the other stops making their share of the payments who 's responsible for repairs and upkeep if you make renovations how does that affect the ownership percentage and what kind of approval do you need from him first and how do you get it and how quickly does he have to respond if he wants to do something to maintain his investment such as how does he negotiate that with you especially if it 's something that requires access to the inside of the house who is the insurance paid by or will each of you be insuring it separately what are the tax implications consider every possible outcome the fact that you 're friends now does n't matter and in fact arguments over money are one of the classic things that kill friendships i 'd be careful making this deal with a relative though in fact i did loan my brother a sizable chunk of change to help him bridge between his old house and new house and that 's registered as a mortgage to formalize it i 'd insist on who owns what even with a spouse since marriages do n't always last with someone who 's just a co worker and casual friend it 's business and only business and needs to be both evaluated and contracted as such to protect both of you if you ca n't make an agreement that you 'd be reasonably comfortable signing with a stranger think long and hard about whether you want to sign it at all i 'll also point out that nobody is completely safe from long term unemployment the odds may be low but people do get blindsided the wave of foreclosures during and after the recent depression is direct evidence of that

tax concerns aside there are managerial pros and cons for internal billing   for cost control purposes it 's common to break individual business activities into divisions sections which have a p&amp;l or are cost centers at that point if you know for example that your quality control inspections cost on average 1 of your product cost then one might bill internally for use of this cost center   one argument for doing this is it makes those who are billed more cautious about using internal resources as there 's a direct cost allocation it also benchmarks that resource against for example it may be significantly cheaper to use an external resource there can therefore be a healthy tension between the cost center and user which in theory results in pressure for the cost center to improve efficiency    in practice i 've found there are some significant cons first issue is with cost allocation the cost center in an attempt to make their service appear more efficient will battle to get minimal overhead costs allocated to them creating friction between departments second and i think a major issue is a blanket cost for use of a service invariably winds up with a lot of exceptions in the previous example there may be some very large programs where a 1 inspection fee winds up with a huge sum of money one that the product team may argue unfairly reduces their net income and therefore compensation then there 's the administrative cost of what essentially is passing money from the left hand to the right even if just on paper third issue is with some activities you might not want to provide a disincentive for people to use the for example charging a product team for quality assurance may result in skipped qa processes for the benefit of cost savings   what i 've found works better is creation of cost centers with management of those centers this is common in companies that have a matrix organizational structure using the same example again qa costs are broken out and completely separated from other areas and qa management is independently

that is such a vague statement i highly recommend disregarding it entirely as it is impossible to know what they meant their goal is to convince you that index funds are the way to go but depending on what they consider an active trader they may be supporting their claim with irrelevant data their definition of active trader could mean any one or more of the following 1 retail investor 2 day trader 3 mutual fund 4 professional investor 5 fund continuously changing its position 6 hedge fund i will go through all of these 1 most retail traders lose money there are many reasons for this some rely on technical strategies that are largely unproven some buy rumors on penny stocks in hopes of making a quick buck some follow scammers on twitter who sell newsletters full of bogus stock tips some ca nt get around the psychology of trading and thus close out losing positions late and winning positions early or never at all i myself use to do this i am certain 99 of retail traders ca nt beat the market because most of them to be frank put less effort into deciding what to trade than in deciding what to have for lunch even though your pension funds presentation is correct with respect to retail traders it is largely irrelevant as professionals managing your money should not fall into any of these traps 2 i call day traders active traders but its likely not what your pension fund was referring to day trading is an entirely different animal to long or medium term investing and thus i also think the typical performance is irrelevant as they are not going to manage your money like a day trader anyway so the important question becomes do active funds lose 99 of the time compared to index funds no no no no according to the wsj actively managed funds outperformed passive funds in 2007 2009 2013 2015 2010 was basically a tie so 5 out of 9 years i do nt have a calculator on me but i believe that is less than 99    what s interesting is that this false belief that index funds are always better has become so pervasive that you can see active funds have huge outflows and passive have huge inflows it is becoming a crowded trade i will spare you the about large crowds and small doors also index funds are so heavily weighted towards a handful of stocks that you end up becoming a anyway the s&p is almost indistinguishable from aapl earlier this year only 6 stocks were responsible for over 100 of gains in the nasdaq index do nt think fb has a good long term business model or that gilead and amzn are a cheap buy well too bad if you bought qqq because those 3 stocks are your now see here 6 that graphic is for mutual funds but your pension fund may have also been including hedge funds in their 99 figure while many do nt beat their own benchmark its less than 99 and there are reasons for it many have investors that are impatient fortress just had to close one of its funds whose bets may actually pay off years from now but too many people wanted their money out some hedge funds also have rules eg long only which can really limit your performance while important to be aware of this that placing your money with a hedge fund may not beat a benchmark that does not automatically mean you should go with an index fund so when are index funds useful when you do nt want to do any thinking when you do nt want to follow market news at all then they are appropriate

graphs are nothing but a representation of data every time a trade is made a point is plotted on the graph after points are plotted they are joined in order to represent the data in a graphical format   think about it this way   1 walmart shuts at 12 am is selling almonds at $ 10 a pound   3 walmart says that the price is going to reduce to $ 9 effective tomorrow 4 you are inside the store buying almonds at pm   5 till you make your way up to the counter it is already am so the store is technically shut 6 however they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there   7 you purchase the almonds at $ 9 since the day has changed 8 so you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph 9 when those points are joined the curves on the graph will be created 10 the data source is walmart 's system as it reflects the sale to you in your case the nyse exchange records this trade made buying a stock is just like buying almonds there has to be a buyer there has to be a seller there has to be a price to which both agree as soon as all these conditions are met and the trade is made it is reflected on the graph the only difference between the graphs from 9 pm and 4 am is the time the trade has happened regardless and any other stock exchange has recorded it the graph is just made from that data cheers

because it appears you have in the neighborhood of 30 years on your mortgage for the first house if you can sell it you will likely be better off in the end   while renting has the potential for greater income it is a business   and like any business there are risks expenses and work required to make it successful   there will be times where you can not find a renter immediately and will be responsible for making both payments maintaining both houses the for an owner is higher for a rental property than a domicile and paying the applicable taxes    you need to look at your best and worst case numbers   if your best case numbers leave you in the hole 300/month then that is not the sort of business you want to run   your investment should build your savings and retirement funds not deplete them   further you are more likely to fall between your best and worst case   so you need to be able to thrive at that level   if something in the middle is going to take you into bankruptcy then sell the property   if you are not willing to put the time into your business that it will need my rental home took about 10 30 hours a month despite renters being responsible for basic upkeep and maintenance    finally your plan b   a home with 800k value will have higher costs and expenses and maintenance   if the 800k home is the home you and your family needs then by all means go for it   but if it can do just as well in the 450k home then go there   pay the home off early by making the payments you would be making for the 800k home   in this way you pay less in total cost of the home and set your self up for the greatest chance of success   once that home is paid off the break even point for renting goes way down as well   so the rental option could be in the future   i would just it now if possible

if you had n't done it already cut up the cards do n't close the accounts because it could hurt your credit score even more switching some or all of the cc debt onto low rate cards or a debt consolidation loan is a way that some people use to reduce their credit card payments   the biggest risk is that you become less aggressive with the loan payback if you were planning on paying $ 800 in minimum payments plus $ 200 extra each month then still pay $ 1000 with the new loan and remaining credit cards   another risk is that you start the credit card again because you have available credit on the card that was paid off with the loan the third risk which you have n't proposed occurs when people switch unsecured credit card dept to a secured 2nd mortgage debt this then puts the family home at risk

the issue is that housing price increases ca n't sustain themselves indefinitely in comparison to the rental market increases drive people back to the rental market which brings the rental market up   also just as a airbnb would drive property prices to go up it also allows people who would otherwise not be able to buy a house to make the house purchase example is a mortgage lender that will give you a cheaper loan if you put your house on airbnb. that enables people to purchase a home when they otherwise would n't be able to so over time many years the market should work itself out   in the short term airbnb can definitely cause market fluctuations for example it might enable people to continue to own their homes during a depression which would cause a supply shortage    the only factor that affects ownership prices differently than rental prices in the long term would be regulation here 's a good seattle builds apartments but vancouver bc builds about that aspect specifically

as long as you paid 90 of the taxes you owed you are good and there will be no negative consequences these calculations are supposed to help you find the right amount not to bind you to it so you do n't need to worry too much about the most common problem is that people underpay and not come up to the 90 limit and do n't have the cash to pay when tax day comes if you happen to come in under 90 which will come out when you file taxes you will owe interest for the underpayment as you should have paid it some time ago typically 0.5 per month also up to 10 in addition depending on the situation this is expensive so you should avoid it and playing to hit is dangerous better try to hit about 100 and use the 90 limit as safety margin as intended

a stop loss does not guarantee a sale at the given price it just automatically triggers an unlimited sale as soon as the market reaches the limit depending on the development your sale could be right at slightly under or deeply under the stop loss limit you gave it could even be it is never executed if there are no further deals the point is that each sell needs a partner that buys for that price and if nobody is buying no sale happens no matter what you do automated or manually your stop loss can not force a sale stop loss works well for minor corrections in liquid shares it becomes less useful the less liquid a share is and it will not be for traded shares

you can spend the money quite quickly the problem is that if there is something wrong with the check the bank will ask you for the money back if the check is from a trusted source a trusted friend a business with good reputation etc that 's fine if the money is from an source make sure that having to pay back the money does n't get you into trouble since most people are honest this is fine for a small amount but if it 's more than you can afford to pay back do n't spend it   a simple scam is that people send you checks by mistake the check is for the wrong amount say $ instead of $ 190 and they ask you to send the difference back so you put $ into your account send them $ 720 and six weeks later your bank asks for their $ back if someone pays you too much on a check and asks you to pay them the difference you know it is a scam

i assume you are talking about a publicly traded company listed on a major stock exchange and the buyer resides in the us private companies and non us locations can change the rules really a lot the short answer is no because the company does not own the stock various investors do each investor has to make an individual decision to sell or not sell but there are complications if an entity buys more than about 10 of the company they have to file a declaration with the sec the limit can be higher if they file an assertion that they are buying it solely for investment and are not seeking control of the company if they are seeking control of the company then more paperwork must be filed and if they want to buy the whole company they may be required to make a tender offer where they offer to buy any and all shares at a specific price if the company being bought is a financial institution then the buyer may have to declare as a bank holding company and more regulations apply the company can advise shareholders not to take the tender offer but they can not forbid it so the short answer is below 10 and for investment purposes only it is cash and carry whoever has the cash gets to carry the stock away above that various regulations and apply but the company still does not have the power prevent the purchase in most circumstances

your credit card limit is nothing more than a simple number   when you purchase something the merchant receives a number i.e. the amount of the transaction from your card company e.g. visa in their bank account and that number is subtracted from your limit added to your balance the amount is recorded and is n't changed so that 's how they get the exact amount you paid   transferring a number is easier than the retailer having to wait for cash to get from you to your card company to them   moving numbers around is the basis of the modern financial system and yes it is always a risk to let someone else have your credit card number   an untrustworthy company person may use it to charge you without your permission or if they have your full details they could use it as if they were you   with a reputable retailer like amazon the main risk is data theft if a security hole is found in amazon 's system someone could steal your credit card info and misuse it

is my math correct the math is correct however dividends do n't work this way the yield is post facto i.e. given the dividend that is declared every quarter once calculates the yield the dividends are not fixed or guaranteed these change from quarter to quarter or at times they are not given at all the yield is and the value is $ 114 per share assuming that the price remains exactly the same for an entire year and that i purchase only one share then this should be the math for calculating the yield 114 x = what the link is showing is that last dividend of mcd was for q3 that means total for a year will be 4 this means yield will be note this year there were only 3 dividend was on on and on it is unlikely that there will be one more dividend this year so for this year the correct post facto calculation would be + = and hence an yield of   also are there any fees deductions or would i receive the amount in full which should be $ 3.75 there are no fee deducted not sure about us tax treatment on dividends

i agree that you should consider a shares based dividend income sipp however unless you 've done self executed trading before enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you 're getting into i would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game i took up self executed trading in 2008 oh yes what a great time to learn and whilst i might have chosen a better time to get into it and despite being quite successful over all i have to say it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done the biggest reason it 'll be hard is emotionally because this pension pot is all the money you 've got to live off until you die right so even though you may choose safe quality stocks when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong and your pension pot will still plummet somewhat at least unless you beat the market something you should not expect to do if you have n't done it before taking the rather abysmal as a benchmark all quality stocks right lol from last highs to this months lows and projecting that performance forwards to the end of march assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out £ 1000 per month your pot could be worth £ k after one year where as with normal stable long term market performance i.e. no horrible devaluation of the market it could be worth £ k going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out £ 1000 per month from 36 years to 24 years even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1 higher return it could still only improve to 30 years normally of course any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well so in my view a sipp with stocks and shares should be at most just a part of your strategy and if you ca n't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve then maybe a sipp with stocks and shares should be a smaller part when you 're dependent on your sipp for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income all that said now even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs etc i think your property idea might not be a bad one it 's just diversification at the end of the day and that 's rarely a bad thing i really don't think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though it 's not impossible to get a 10 yield from a property but usually you wo n't i assume you 've never done buy to let before so i would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully if you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really really exceptional properties to get that sort of return and you wo n't find them all the time when you do your spread sheet make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs build a ledger effectively so that you can plot all your costs income and on going balance and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years say 10 take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing you must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations your tenants won't respect your property like you would i promise you land lord insurance do n't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve at least 10 20 k say i mean it it 's happened to me it cost me 10 k once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant and it definitely could have been worse but i do n't really recommend you insuring yourself like this and taking on the inherent risk budget for plumber and electrician call out or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance etc basically more insurance also consider estate agent fees which will be either finders fees and/or 10 management fees if you do n't manage them yourself if you manage it yourself fine but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you either temporarily or permanently budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent do n't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant for do n't forget ground rent you can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage because you make money out of the underlying roi and the mortgage apr this is usually the only way you can approach 10 yield but do n't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees valuation fees legal fees etc every 2 years or however long and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

without using the cash advance feature of your credit card i 'm going to say no   no mortgage lender would let you simply charge the down payment to your credit card the reason is the merchant transaction fees   typical credit card transaction fees that the merchant pays are around 3   if the lender accepted credit cards on a $ 30 k down payment they would be giving up around $ 900 in addition to that the whole reason for requiring a down payment is to ensure that the buyer has some equity in their own home   many lenders will want to know the source of the down payment and will not allow you to borrow this down payment because they want to ensure that you are not too far into debt   no money down home purchases are much more rare than they were 10 years ago

okay savings in a nutshell so take at least year 's worth of rent $ 30k or so maybe more for additional expenses that 's your core emergency fund for when you lose your job or total a few cars or something keep it in a good savings account maybe a cd ladder but the point is it 's liquid and you can get it when you need it in case of emergency replenish it immediately after using it you may lose a little cash to inflation but you need liquidity to protect you from risk it is worth it the rest is long term savings probably for retirement or possibly for a down payment on a home a blended set of stocks and bonds is appropriate with stocks storing most of it if saving for retirement you may want to put the stocks in a tax deferred account if only for the reduced paperwork stocks generate so much having some money especially bonds in something like a roth ira or a non tax advantaged account is also useful as a backup emergency fund because you can withdraw it without penalties take the money out of stocks gradually when you are approaching the time when you use the money if it 's closer than five years do n't use stocks your money should be mostly bonds when you 're about to use it and not 30-year bonds or anything like that either those are sensitive to interest rates in the short term you should have bonds that mature approximately the same time you 're going to use them keep an eye on that if you 're using bond funds which continually roll over that 's basically how any savings goal should work retirement is a little special because it 's sort of like 20 years worth of savings goals so you do n't want all your savings in bonds at the beginning and because you can get fancy tax deferred accounts but otherwise it 's about the same thing college savings likewise there are tools available to help you with this an asset allocation calculator can be found from a variety of sources including most investment firms you can use a target date fund for something this if you 'd like automation there are also a couple things like say vanguard funds from vanguard which target other savings goals you may be able to understand the way these sorts of instruments function more easily than you could other investments you could do a decent job for yourself by just opening up an account at vanguard using their online tool and pouring your money into the stuff they recommend

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

it is certainly legal to transfer money between people no matter how often as long as the money is not originally from illegal sources if you are gaining in the process you need to pay taxes on your net gain as on any income but as always taxed income is still income consider the accumulating transaction cost the inherent risk of your friend keeping the money and the risk of the exchange rate going the other way but otherwise it is a simple arbitrage business there are thousands of people who do that all year long at stock exchanges and money markets you might be able to do it more efficient there and you do n't need a friend on the other side for that

should i allow the credit cards to be paid out of escrow in one lump    sum or should i take the cash and pay the cards down over a few    months i have heard that it is better for your credit score to pay    them down over time will it make much of a difference will the money you save by increasing your credit score assuming this statement is true be larger than by eliminating the interest payments for the credit card payments over a few months 13 apr at $ 24,000 is $ a year in interest $ 260 a month so if a few months is three that would cost over $ 700 note that as you pay more principal the overall amount of interest decreases so the a year in interest could go down depending on the principal payments also on a related note regarding credit score it does n't look good to have more than a third of a credit line available balance exceeded see number 2 here

if you look around online and read about credit scores you 'll find all kinds of information about what you should do to maximize your credit score   however in my opinion it just is n't worth rearranging your life just to try to achieve some arbitrary score   if you pay your bills on time and are regularly using a credit card your score will take care of itself yes you can cut up the card you do n't like and keep the credit card account open   the bank may close your account at some point in the future because of a lack of activity but if they do do n't worry about it   you have other accounts that you are using   personally i do n't like having open credit accounts that i 'm not using i close accounts when i 'm done with them   i realize that it goes against everything that you will read but my score is very high and my oldest open credit card account is 2 years old   do n't let them scare you into credit activity that you do n't want just to try to win at the credit score

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

the real answer why the government is allowed to do something is because they are the government and they make the rules there are lots of laws that i think make no sense i ran into a similar situation to yours i bought a house during a time when the market in my area was way down the previous owner had paid $ 140,000 but i got it for only $ 80,000 the government appraised it for i forget the exact number but over $ 100,000 i appealed and the argument i made to the appeal board was that the law says it is supposed to be appraised for fair market value the definition of fair market value is the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller absent special conditions like a sweetheart sale to a relative the house had been advertised for a higher price and the seller had to drop the price several times before getting an offer and finally accepting mine this is pretty much the definition of fair market value the appeals board replied that it was not fmv because the market was bad at this particular time and so i got a good deal i said that that 's the definition of market value it goes up and down as market conditions change if the market happened to be up when someone bought a house and they had to pay a high price would the government assess the house at a lower value because that was an unusually high price i doubt it they ended up reducing the assessed value but not to what i actually paid all that said arguably a foreclosure sale might be considered special conditions prices at a foreclosure sale tend to be lower than ordinary sales in a foreclosure the bank is usually trying to get rid of the property quickly because they do n't want to be in the property management business they want to be in the money lending and management business of course you could say that sort of thing about conditions surrounding many sales maybe the price is low because the seller needed cash now to start a business maybe the price is high because the buyer was too lazy to shop around maybe the price is low because the buyer is a very skilled negotiator etc etc   my watch just broke and while i was shopping for a new one i found two listings for the exact same watch i mean exact same manufacturer and model number identical picture on the same web site one giving the price as $ 24 and the other as $ 99 what is the market value of that watch i presume anyone who saw both listings would pick the $ 24 one but i presume some number of people pay the higher price because they never see the lower price in real life there is n't really one exact fair market value that 's an abstraction

honestly i wonder if the other are n't overthinking it their answers are detailed and correct but what your coach may be saying is this when you have bought a stock on cash or margin and you are watching it rise you are evaluating when you sell on the price of the stock you are seeing in reality you should look at the bid price buyers will give you for the stock and ask price sellers will charge you for the stock prices if the stock is going up odds are the price of the stock is very close to the ask price because it is purchases that are driving it up but that 's not what you 're going to get when you sell you 're going to get something around the bid price if the spread between the two is large i.e. a volatile stock this could be many cents or more lower than the ask price therefore what your coach may mean by selling on ask is you 're using the stock price when it 's equal or close to the ask price to decide when to sell instead of letting the stock peak and drop when its price will approach the bid price or letting the trailing bid offers catch up to your desired sell point and selling then i.e. letting the stock point grow past your sell point dragging the bid price up with it just a thought but that sounds like a term a coach would come up with to mean selling and getting less than you thought you were going to from the sale i know it 's a reply but the interwebs are and people come via google i did

consider the opportunity cost of the extra repayment on a 15 year loan   if you owe money at 30 p.a and money at 4 p.a then it is a no brainer that the 30 loan gets paid down first consider too that if the mortgage is not tax deductable and you pay income tax that you do not pay tax on money you save i.e. in the extreme $ 1 saved is $ 2 earned forward thinking is key if you are paying for someone 's college now then you would want to pay out of an education plan for which contributions are tax deductable money in money out in my country most mortgages be they years tend to last 6 8 years for the lender people move or flip or re finance   i would take the 15 for the interest rate but only if i could sustain the payments without hardship maybe a more modest home    if you can not afford the higher repayments you are probably sailing a bit close to the wind anyway    another thing to consider is that tax benefits can be altered with the stroke of a pen but you may still have to meet repayments

can anyone recommend a good textbook that covers fannie mae and freddie mac or more broadly the us home mortgage market a basic search seems to mostly turn up books that aim to make an ideological point rather than attempt to provide an actual explanation   i have a basic financial knowledge including a basic understanding of derivatives at the level of say the textbook by hull but know very little about the us mortgage market specifically i do n't mind technical detail and am not afraid of math i do n't mind if the book is broader as long as it includes a reasonably in depth look at these gses and their role   this seems to be a pretty basic piece of knowledge for many financial professionals so i assume there must be at least one standard textbook on this that i just have n't been able to find   edit i 'm looking for something post 2008 of course

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets it does seem strange that there is a correlation between government debt and the stock market   but i could see many reasons for the reaction   the downgrade by s&p may make it more expensive for the government to borrow money i.e. higher interest rates   this means it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money and the government will probably need to raise taxes to cover the cost of borrowing   rising taxes are not good for business   also many banks in the us hold us government debt   rising yields will push down the value of their holdings which in turn will reduce the value of us debt on the businesses balance sheets   this weakens the banks balance sheets   they may even start to unload us bonds why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating i do n't know   i think they have proven they are practically useless   that 's just my opinion   many though still think they are a credible ratings agency what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached theoretically the government has to stop borrowing money once the debt ceiling is reached   if this occurs and the government does not raise the debt ceiling then the government faces three choices

i use 10-k and to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business sometimes they are very comical but when you see that risk factor you can understand how it will effect the company for example one company 's risk factor stated that if elizabeth warren becomes head of the consumer financial protection bureau we will have a hard time so we are expanding in mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there i like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more an example was where i heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management poor questionable misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so i started digging into their sec filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher while experiencing no change in market cap but then digging further i saw that they were only changing the already issued shares but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares i that this would mean the share prices would drop by after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this employees or the broad market i was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if i could borrow their shares to short because there was n't enough liquidity on the stock market this was almost the perfect short but it was n't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all it traded from $ 20 after the reverse split to $ i like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon this is generally what i use those particular forms for but they contain a lot of information a lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read

it depends on how much money it is going to save you how secure your job is and how much risk is acceptable to you the main problem with taking out a 401k loan for anything is that you have to pay it back within ~60 days of loosing your job which would be precisely when you need your savings the most and then you get the tough choice of using your savings to repay the 401k loan assuming you have an emergency fund or possibly not having enough money to live on until you find another job if you do n't have an emergency fund you are going to get stuck with a substantial tax bill 10 penalty plus taxes at your marginal rate there are definitely advantages to avoiding pmi and you will probably get a pretty decent return on investment mortgage interest rate + cost of pmi but there are risks as well

adding a couple more assumptions i 'd compute about $ would be that pay out in 2018   this is computed by taking the current portfolio 's holdings par values and dividing by the outstanding for those wanting specific figures used now for those assumptions something to keep in mind is that bonds can valued higher than their face value if the coupon is higher than other issues given the same risk   if you have 2 bonds maturing in 3 years of the same face value and same risk categories though one is paying 5 and the other is paying 10 then it may be that the 5 sells at a discount to bring the yield up some while the other sells at a premium to bring the yield down   thus you could have bonds worth more before they mature that will eventually lose this capital appreciation

to answer the first part of your question yes i 've done that   i did even a bit more   i once had a job that i was n't sure i 'd keep and the economy was n't great either   in case my next employer would n't let me contribute to a 401(k from day one and because i did n't want to my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill i front loaded my 401(k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year   the contribution limits were lower than $ back then as for the reduced cash flow you need of course a buffer account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or front loading 401(k contributions   you should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck   as for the reduced cash flow i think large scale contributions can crowd out other long term saving   priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the trade off between them is a real concern   if they 're out basic and discretionary consumer expenses that 's a totally different kind of problem which you do n't seem to have which is great so about the trade off between large scale 401(k contributions and saving for the down payment   i 'd say maxing out 401(k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends   if after several years of maxing out your 401(k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority you 'll see money flow to the money market account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate thanks to that savings culture as for the increasing future earnings no   most people i 've known for a long time if they saved 20 when they made $ 20k year they continued to save 20 or more when they later made $ 100k year   people who spent the entire paycheck while making $ 50k year always say if only i got a raise to $ 60k year i 'd save a few thousand   but they eventually graduate to $ 100k year and still spend the entire paycheck   it 's all about your savings culture on the second part of your question yes roth is a great tool especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the long term budget deficits   so contributing to 401(k to maximize the match then max out roth as others suggested is a great advice   after you 've done that see what else you can do more 401(k saving for the house etc

first i want to say that i agree with you that the rule   now on to economics   i will try to address each of your points as best i can    -the lack of demand is aggregate demand   this includes individual spending corporate spending government spending and exports   individual spending is down as pointed out   whether or not that is a good thing let 's reserve for later   next corporate spending is at all time lows   the s&amp;p 500 companies have the highest cash on hand ever in history   nobody is hiring   bond issues are down   mergers are down   capital is being hoarded   third up government spending   we all know this is up but do n't rush to add in the fed and bailouts to this number lets just consider it what the government actually spends into the economy   lastly exports are down because the rest of the world is hurting   so 3 out of the 4 components of aggregate demand are down and there are those that want the government to stop spending as well which would make it a straight 4 for 4    rates   well if you know that aggregate demand is down that tells you everything you need to know about interest rates   if companies were borrowing hiring expanding opening plants etc etc etc then interest rates would naturally rise due to loans being made to these companies   the fact is that companies are not expanding and loans are not being made due to no demand for them   bank reserves are at an all time high   nobody is willing to take out a loan to grow their business right now because aggregate demand is down so hard   at the same time the stock market spooked everyone and on top of it people are paying down their home mortgages at a record pace   so you have record low demand for loans and record high supply of capital money so yeah interest rates are at 1 effectively 0 if you are in a savings account    the currency to boost the exports component of the aggregate demand curve seems like it could work but since the rest of the world is also hurting who are you going to export to   the corporate sector is n't going to start spending until the consumer is on their feet   the consumer is n't going to start spending until they get jobs   do you see the chinese finger trap here   the only way out of the is to increase government spending and history has shown that it works

a mutual fund makes distributions of its dividends and capital gains usually once a year or or quarterly or monthly etc it does not distribute any capital losses to its shareholders but holds them for offsetting capital gains in future years cf this answer of mine to a different question a stock pays   dividends a stock neither has nor does it   distribute capital gains you get capital gains or losses when you sell the shares of the stock but these are not called distributions of any kind similarly you incur capital gains or losses when you   redeem shares of mutual funds but these are not called distributions   either note that non etf mutual fund shares are generally not bought and sold on stock exchanges you buy shares directly from the fund and you sell shares back redeem them directly to the fund   all of the above transactions are taxable events for the year to you unless the shares are being held in a tax deferred account or are tax free for other reasons e.g. dividends from a municipal bond fund

the basis of homeowner 's insurance pricing is the or amount of insurance   this pertains to the cost to rebuild the dwelling in the event of a total loss   the standard coverages e.g. contents loss of use medical payments liability are calculated relative to this amount   consequently the is selected by the value of the dwelling   this is why it is important that if parts of the dwelling are upgraded that the cost of those upgrades are taken into account the question is not one of denying claims should a loss occur unless the nature of the upgrade is such that policy should not have been underwritten in the first place   this can happen if for example the homeowner builds an extension onto the house that damages the structural integrity of the dwelling in the end the is still just an estimate but the takeaway is that like scheduled personal property jewelry rare collectibles or other endorsements every home and homeowner has slightly different insurance needs and it is in your interest to tailor your coverage to be as accurate as possible in reflecting your needs   insurance is not a one size fits all product consequently the selection of sufficient coverage for your mix of risks is only prudent   now if after you get a quote back and you find that the premium is too high you can typically select a deductible that can reduce it but you have to consider what amount of exposure you are willing to retain   you should shop around too   different insurers use different methods and criteria to price their products so even if the coverage is substantially similar the premiums may vary   for example some insurers ask whether you own a dog exposure to liability claims but others do not   some insurers put more weight on your dwelling 's geographic location exposure to fire theft wind hail than others

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match

electric does make a difference when considering whether to lease or buy the make model is something to consider the state you live in also makes a difference if you are purchasing a small electric compliance car like the fiat leasing is almost always a better deal these cars are often only available in certain states california and oregon and the lease deals available are very enticing for example the fiat is often available at well under $ 100/mo in a three year lease with $ 0 down while purchasing it would cost far more $ 30k minus credits rebates = $ 20k even when considering the residual value if you want to own a tesla model s i recommend purchasing a used car the market is somewhat flooded with used teslas because some owners like to upgrade to the latest and greatest features and take a pretty big loss on their old tesla you can save a lot of money on a pre owned model s with relatively low miles and the battery packs have been holding up well if you have your heart set on a new model s i would treat it like any other vehicle and do the comparison of lease vs buy one thing to keep in mind that buying a model s before the end of 2016 will grandfather you into the free for life which makes the car more valuable in the future right now there is a $ 7500 federal tax credit when buying an electric vehicle if you lease the leasing company gets the credit not you the cost of the lease should indirectly reflect this credit however some states have additional incentives california has a $ 2500 rebate for example that you can receive even if you lease the vehicle to summarize a small compliance car often has very good reasons to lease an expensive luxury car like the tesla can be looked at like any other lease vs buy decision and buying a used model s may save the most money

without knowing what you are trying to achieve make a bit of pocket money become financially independent invest for retirement learn trading to become a trader i 'll give you a few thoughts   the difficulty you will have trading with $ 400 600 is that brokerage will be a high proportion of your profits i 'm not sure of the us assuming us rather than au nz etc rates for online brokers but uk online brokers are the order of £ 6 10 trade having a quick read suggests that the trading is similar $ 6 with doing day trades you will be killed by the brokerage i 'm not sure what percent of profitable trades you have but if it is 50 e.g. you will need to make twice the brokerage fees value on each profitable trade before you are actually making a profit there can be an emotional effect that trips you up you will find that trading with your own real money is very different to trading with fake money read up about it this brief blog shows some personal thoughts from someone i read from time to time with a $ 10 brokerage i would suggest the following another option which i would n't recommend is to leverage your money by trading or other derivatives that allow you to trade on a margin further to that learn about trading investing plus other investment types i have written about earlier

the typical scam is that they overpay you or for some obscure reason they claim and they ask you to wire the extra money either back or to someone else because you wire it that money is gone for sure then they undo the original transaction or it turns out it was fake anyway and you end up with a loss maybe he claims that he wants to buy some more stuff and the fees are high so he sends you all the payments in one amount and you pay the other sellers from it something like that there are honest though actually most of them either way the real problem is that the original payment is fake whichever way it comes to you you need to make sure that it can not be reversed or declared invalid after you think you have it wire transfer is the only way i know that is not reversible bank transfers are reversible do n't think you have it just because it arrives in your bank account talk to your bank about what all can happen if you make the deal when you send the bike think about insuring it and make him pay for that too that way you are out of any loss risk

first a quick terminology correction i believe you 're proposing selling 10,000 shares of the stock of a company not 10,000 stocks when you sell you need to decide whether you 're selling for a specific minimum price or just selling for whatever price you can get if you set a specific lower limit on asking price then if people are n't interested at that price it does n't sell which may mean you sell only a few shares or none if your asking price is n't considered reasonable if you want to sell independent of price then as you begin to flood the market with your shares the price you get per additional share may decline until it finds a buyer what that lower limit is will depend on what people think the stock is currently worth this is one of the many complications i do n't want to deal with which is why i stick with index funds

several people have mentioned the obvious inflation   but let 's assume we are talking about real inflation adjusted prices one argument is that populations keep rising while the land does not change   so the price of homes in desirable places gets pushed up and people move to second best locations pushing those prices up etc   similar argument holds for raw materials steel granite fine wood etc another argument is that the economy has a long term upward trajectory that 's the assumption   so each generation as a whole has more disposable real income than the previous   as disposable income increases people tend to put more and more money into their homes pushing prices up   true for all goods of course but it may be more true for real estate than for other types of goods

a living wage = /= giving them everything     i really do n't think anyone disagrees with you that entry level positions result in lower wages than more advanced skilled positions i think the notion of this thread is more pay people enough to eat have a roof over their head and be able to afford transportation that 's what i mean by livable wage

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

i 'm sorry for the confusion   i believe the link attached to the baja condo fiasco outlines it there   but here is more info note his daughter said this speaking on his behalf   trump said nothing to correct it until the lawsuits started of course   here is an la times article      his daughter trump said in 2007 that her father is the boss when asked about his role in the project he is involved in every capacity she said   from apps = = buyers were led to think that trump played an active role in development and held an equity stake and that his children donald trump jr. and trump executives in his company had bought condo units the suit claims   also concealed from condo buyers that it failed to obtain construction financing after credit markets last year while continuing to withdraw their deposits from escrow accounts according to the complaint the defendants allegedly set up a shell company in mexico to deflect liability   gt; but sometimes investments are lost for a variety of reasons   i totally agree with you   trump just happens to have a consistent record for ripping people off   over 17 times that i can count in less than 14 years   i wo n't bore you with it but check out his latest money making project in tampa   investors screwed he makes his money and behind the tools of the law

for your base question yes   barring some major collapse of civilization event but in that case you 're screwed anyway   on the individual points 1 depends on whether you choose to invest in index type funds where profit is mainly expected from price appreciation or more value based investing   but either or a mix of the two my own choice should show returns above inflation over the long term 2 yes in the us anyway   you can invest a few hundred dollars at a time and with good companies like vanguard t. rowe price there are no transaction fees either for investing or for redeeming    3 long term it 's crash proof if you have the self discipline not to panic sell at market lows   in my case my total fund valuation dropped around 40 in 08   i did n't sell anything and in fact tried to cut spending and invest more and now i have nearly double what i had before the crash bottom line is that it has worked for me   after ~30 years of investing this way without being fanatic about it i have enough that i could live moderately without working for the rest of my life   not and this is where i part company with mmm and most of the fire community that i 'd ever want to actually retire   but my modest financial independence gives me the freedom to work at things i like rather than because i 'm worrying about paying bills

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

in the united states you ca n't because the average millennial in the united states has no opportunity to save money either you get a college education then you will be burdened with a student loan the cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades it is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents or you skip college but college is the only way in the united states to obtain a generally accepted qualification so you wo n't get any job which pays enough to save any money as soon as that student loan is paid off you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades as soon as the house debt is paid off you will be old and develop some medical problems the medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again so when in their life are millennials supposed to save money

presumably you 're talking about the different share class introduced in the recent stock split which mean that there are now three google share classes due to the voting rights class a shares should be worth more than class c but how much only time will tell actually one could very well argue that a non voting share of a company that pays no dividends has no value at all it 's unlikely the markets will see it that way though

not sure if you are serious golf courses require a large number of people working on it jobs created    property development including building of the golf course creates a large number of temporary jobs and long term jobs upkeep services and the opportunity for new local businesses to open the rich folk moving in will probably want to keep their house clean services their yard kept landscaping service their cars maintained auto shop services their dogs pets cared for pet care services their organic food food markets etc in addition by having the rich folks there the mid to luxury store front brands might decide to open up locations in the area a smart developer would build a small open air mall to complement their housing this creates jobs it might not seem like much but when your family is barely making ends meet a few extra hundred dollars each week can make a huge difference    in addition the new business generates taxes for the city

the best predictor of mutual fund performance is low expense ratio as reported by morningstar despite the fact that it produces the star ratings you cite most of the funds you list are actively managed and thus have high expense ratios even if you believe there are mutual fund managers out there that can pick investments intelligently enough to offset the costs versus a passive index fund do you trust that you will be able to select such a manager most people that are n't trying to sell you something will advise that your best bet is to stick with low cost passive index funds i only see one of these in your options which is fidelity spartan 500 index fund fidelity advantage class with an exceptionally low expense ratio of 0.05 do you have other investment accounts with more choices like an ira if so you might consider putting a major chunk of your 401(k money into and use your ira to balance your overall with and medium cap domestic stock international stock and bond funds as an aside i remember seeing a funny comment on this site once that is applicable here something along the lines of do n't take investment advice from coworkers unless they 're warren buffett or bill gross

the problem is you are trying to qualify for a loan that has a 25 down payment using money you do n't have which defeats the purpose of having a down payment the best thing to do is have your parents buy the house for you you then rent the house from them where your rent is equal to the mortgage + x. your parents then put x into savings account for you and then once you have 25 in that account they gift it to you and you purchase the house from them using that 25 as the downpayment for the mortgage

from irs publication 970 tax benefits for education note qualified tuition programs are also called 529 plans   changing the designated beneficiary there are no income tax consequences if the designated beneficiary of    an account is changed to a member of the beneficiary 's family see    members of the beneficiary 's family earlier   members of the beneficiary 's family for these purposes the beneficiary 's family includes the    beneficiary 's spouse and the following other relatives of the    beneficiary regarding ownership changes rollovers any amount distributed from a qtp is n't taxable if it is rolled over    to another qtp for the benefit of the same beneficiary or for the    benefit of a member of the beneficiary 's family including the    beneficiary 's spouse an amount is rolled over if it is paid to    another qtp within 60 days after the date of the distribution do n't report qualifying rollovers those that meet the above criteria    anywhere on form 1040 or 1040nr these are n't taxable distributions example when aaron graduated from college last year he had $ 5,000 left in his    qtp he wanted to give this money to his younger brother who was in    junior high school in order to avoid paying tax on the distribution    of the amount remaining in his account aaron contributed the same    amount to his brother 's qtp within 60 days of the distribution so it appears that as far as the irs in concerned the rollover could be done to change ownership as long as the beneficiary was in the same family it is possible that there could be a state tax issue with the change of ownership if it changed from a plan in state a to one in state b and state a treated the original contributions as a tax deduction so check the guidelines for the specific 529 plan

if that condition is permanent the stock will never pay dividends and you will never be able to sell it then yes it sounds to me like this is a worthless piece of paper if there is some possibility that the stock will pay dividends in the future or that a market will exist to sell it then you are making a long term investment it all depends on how likely it is that the situation will change if the investment is small maybe it 's worth it

there is no need for micropayments monthly payments or harassment   a loan agreement can be drafted that your mom makes one payment annually to you instead of monthly payments depending on what she and you might be comfortable   with this payment could be interest only or partly interest and part repayment   of principal   or you can set it up so that there is a balloon payment due when   the loan say in five years time and she pays back the entire   principal and accumulated interest if you trust her to pay back the money   you do n't need to ask for collateral or security and you do n't need to turn the debt over to a collection agency or send large men with baseball bats to call on mom if you just want mom to return the principal when she is ready to so so and do n't really want to charge her interest then set up the loan to require annual payment of interest only and the entire principal at   the end of the agreement then each year a few days before the   interest payment is due send her a check for the interest due as a gift   mom deposits the check in her account and sends back the interest payment to you so no harm no foul you have   made her a gift presumably less than the $ 13 k exemption she has paid you interest but there is no net transfer of money and as far as the irs are concerned this is a legitimate loan do keep copies of the paperwork though and be sure to report the interest payment on your income tax returns as income to you by extension if you do n't really want the money back set up the loan so that the annual payment is $ 13 k and is part the annual interest due and part the principal until the loan is paid off
