an advantage of using a major credit card is that they act as a buffer and source of recourse between you and the merchant cheated and the store wo n’t answer you letters call visa or more call the number on the back of the card that is 2 on this answer which you can also reference for a whole list of benefits

paying it off over time which i know is the point of the card that may very well be the card issuer 's goal but it need not be yours the benefits as your question title seems to ask for   that said use the card but do n't spend more than you have in your checking account to pay it when the bill comes   what you may want to hear charge the furniture pay it off over the next year even at the total interest on $ 2000 of furniture will only be $ 200 if you account for the declining balance that 's $ for a year of enjoying the furniture   you see you can talk yourself into a bad decision instead shop but do n't buy lay out the plan to buy each piece as you save up for it consider what would happen if you buy it all on the card and then have any unexpected expenses it just gets piled on top of that and you 're down a slippery slope

there are a couple of things to consider    first in order to avoid interest charges you generally just need to pay the statement balance before the statement due date   this is your grace period   you do n't need to monitor your activity every day and send immediate payments   if you 're being really tight with money you can actually make a little profit by letting your cash sit in an interest bearing account before you pay your credit card before the due date second credit card interest rates are pretty terrible and prescribed minimum payments are comically low   if you buy furniture using your credit card you will pay some interest be sure to pay way more than the minimum payment   you should avoid carrying a balance on a credit card   at 20 interest the approximate monthly interest charge on $ 1,000 is $ third if you carry a balance on your credit card you lose the interest grace period the first point above on new charges   if you buy your couch and carry the balance when you buy a soda at 7 11 the soda begins to accrue interest immediately   if you decide to carry a balance on a credit card stop using that card for new charges   it generally takes two consecutive billing period full balance payments to restore the grace period fourth to answer your question using a credit card to carry a balance has no impact on your score   make your payments on time do n't exceed your limits keep your utilization reasonable   the credit agencies have no idea if you 're carrying a balance or how much interest you 're paying to appease the people who think point four needs more words your credit report contains your limit your reported balance generally your statement balance and approximate minimum payment   there is no indication related to whether or not the balance contains a carried balance and/or accrued interest   the mere fact of carrying a balance will not impact your credit score because the credit reporting bureaus do n't know you 're carrying a balance   paying interest does n't help or hurt your score   obviously if your carried balance and interest charges push your utilization up that will impact your score because of the increased utilization make your payments on time do n't exceed your limits keep your utilization reasonable and your score will be fine

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

the thing you need to keep in mind is that if you take on debt you need to have a plan to pay it off and execute on it   you also need to understand what your carrying cost is what you will pay in finance charges every month   there are times when you need to take on debt in order to be a productive person   for example in many places in the us you need a car in order to have a job   it 's ludicrous for someone to assert that you should n't take on any debt in order to get a reliable vehicle   that does n't mean you go out and lease the car that you can get on your income in this case i 'd say it 's a bit of a grey area   could you live in an apartment for a while   perhaps   many people would have a hard time living like that and it could affect your ability to perform at work   i would argue that buying a decent mattress to sleep on falls under the same category as getting a car so that you can work   you do n't want to be missing work because your back is in from sleeping on the floor or a worn out mattress as far as the rest of it goes it really depends on how fast you can pay it off   if you are looking at more than a few months 6 tops to pay off the purchase in full you should reassess   realize that the interest you are paying is increasing the cost of the furniture and act accordingly   as mentioned you can often get 0 financing for a limited period   understand that if you do n't pay off the entire balance in that period you will normally be retroactively charged interest on the entire starting amount and that interest rate will likely be quite high the problem with credit is when you start using it and continually growing the balance   it 's easy to keep saying that you will start paying it off later and the next thing you know you are buried   it 's not a big one time purchase by itself that normally gets people into trouble it 's continual spending beyond their means month after month

never carry a balance on a credit card there is almost always a cheaper way to borrow money the exception to that rule is when you are offered a 0 promotion on a credit card but even then watch out for cash advance fees and how payments are applied typically to promotional balances first paying interest on daily spending is a bad idea generally the only time you should pay interest is on a home loan car loan or education loan   basically that 's because those loans can either allow you to reduce an expense e.g. apartment rent taxi fair or increase your income by getting a better job you can try to make an argument about the utility of a dollar but all aside you are better off investing than borrowing under normal circumstances that said using a credit card with no annual fee can build credit for a future car or home loan the biggest advantage of a credit card is cash back if you have good credit you can get a credit card that offers at least 1 cash back on every purchase   if you do n't have good credit using a credit card with no annual fee can be a good way to build credit until you can get approved for a 2 card e.g. citi double cash additionally technically you can get close to 10 cash back by chasing sign up bonuses however that requires applying for new cards frequently and keeping track of minimum spend etc credit cards also protect you from fraud if someone uses your debit card number you can be short on cash until your bank fixes it   but if someone uses your credit card number you can simply dispute the charge when you get the bill you do n't have to worry about how to make rent after an unexpected charge side note it is a common mis that credit card issuers only make money from cardholder interest and fees card issuers make a lot of revenue from interchange fees paid by merchants every time you use your card some issuers e.g. amex make a majority of their revenue from merchants

credit card interest rates are obscene try to find some other kind of loan for the furnishings if you put things on the card try to pay them off as quickly as possible i should say that for most people i do recommend having a credit card hotels car rental agencies and a fair number of other businesses expect to be able to guarantee your reservation by taking the card info and it is much harder to do business with them without one it gives you a short term emergency fund you can tap and then immediately pay back or as close to immediately as possible credit cards are one of the safer ways to pay via internet since they have guarantees that limit your liability if they are misused and the bank can help you charge back to a vendor who does n't deliver as promised and if you have the self discipline to pay the balance due in full every month they can be a convenient alternative to carrying a checkbook or excessive amounts of cash but there are definitely people who have n't learned how to use this particular tool without hurting themselves remember that it needs to be handled with respect and appropriate caution
# 34833
using the card but paying it off entirely at each billing cycle is the only good way to use a credit card   if you feel like you will be tempted to buy more than you can pay back do n't use credit as far as furnishing the apartment the best thing to do would be to save and pay cash but if you want to use credit the credit available at stores would be a far better deal than carrying it on a card
# 344052
everyone else seems to have focused rightly so on the negatives of credit cards high interest rates and why it is important to pay them off before interest starts accruing only 's answer briefly touched on rewards   to me this is the real purpose of credit cards in today 's age   most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 1 2 cash back on all purchases and sometimes more on other categories   again assuming you can pay the balance in full each month and you are good at budgeting money using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 1 2 of all of the spending you put on your card   again this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full using the above example of 20 interest that 's about 1.6 interest if the interest compounds monthly which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance

in the uk using a credit card adds a layer of protection for consumers if something goes wrong or you bought something that was actually a scam if you inform the credit card company with the necessary documents they   will typically clear the balance for that purchase essentially the burden of debt is passed to them and they themselves will have to chase up the necessary people section 75 of the consumer credit act   i personally use my credit card when buying anything one would consider as   consumer spending tvs furniture ect i then pay off the credit card immediately this gives me the normal benefits of the credit card if you get cashback or points plus the additional consumer credit protection on all my purchases   this in my opinion is the most effective way of using your credit card
# 516955
i just want to stress one point which has been mentioned but only in passing the disadvantage of a credit card is that it makes it very easy to take on a credit paying it off over time which i know is the point of the card then you fell into the trap of the issuer of the card they benefit if you pay off stuff over time that 's why taking up a credit seems to be so easy with a credit sic card all the technical aspects aside you are still in debt and you never ever want to be so if you can avoid it and for any voluntary non essential payment you can avoid it buy furniture that you can pay off in full right now if that means only buying a few pieces or used junk stuff then so be it save up money until you can buy more better pieces
# 275356
if you can use and pay off your credit card in full every month there are plenty of benefits including improved credit reward points and more many fall into the trap of just making the minimum payments and facing high interest charges or missing payments and getting a hit on their credit reports   to start off put something small that you know you can pay off every month it could be your netflix or your gas make sure you pay it off before any interest is accrued over time you can ask for higher limits to boost your utilization rate

credit cards have three important advantages none of them are for day to day borrowing of money safety credit cards have better fraud protection than checks or cash and better than most debit check cards if you buy something with a credit card you also get the issuer 's think visa assurances that your will get the product you paid for or your money back at almost any time if a product you buy is not what you expect you can work with the issuer even if the store says screw you security credit cards are almost universally accepted as a security against damages to the vendor hotels car rentals boat rentals etc will accept a credit card as a means of securing their interests without that you may have to make huge deposits or not be able to rent at all for example in my area you can not rent a car on debit or cash you must use a credit card around here most hotel rooms require a credit card as well this is different from area to area but credit cards are nearly universally accepted emergencies if you 're using your credit card properly then you have some extra padding when stuff goes wrong for example it may be cheaper to place a bill on a credit card for a couple months while you recover from a car accident than to deplete your bank account and have to pay fees bonus some cards have perks like miles points or cash back some can be very beneficial you need to be careful about the rules with these bonuses for example some cards only give you points if you carry a balance some only give miles if you shop at certain stores but if you have a good one these can be pretty fantastic a 3 cash back on purchases can make a large difference over time

one of the more subtle disadvantages to large credit card purposes purchases besides what the other answer mentions is that it makes you less prepared for emergencies if you carry a large balance on your credit card with the idea that your income can easily handle the payments to beat the no interest period you never know when you 'll have an unexpected emergency and you 'll end up having to pay less miss the deadline and end up paying huge interest even if you are about saving and budgeting what if your family comes under a large financial burden just as one possible example

what 's the present value of using the payment plan in all common sense the present value of a loan is the value that you can pay in the present to avoid taking a loan which in this case is the lump sum payment of $   that rather the question is a trick providing irrelevant information about the stock market however if some strange interpretation is required which ignores the lump sum and wants to know how much you need in the present to pay the loan while being able to make 8 on the stock market that can be done i will initially assume that since the lender 's apr works out about 9.6 per month that the 8 from the stock market is also per month but will also calculate for 8 annual effective and an 8 annual nominal rate the calculation if you have $ x in hand present value and it is exactly enough to take the loan while investing in the stock market the value in successive months is $ x plus the market return less the loan payment   in the third month the loan is paid down so the balance is zero i.e. so the present value of using the payment plan while investing is $ you would need $ to cover the loan while investing which is more than the $ lump sum payment requires   therefore it would be advisable to make the lump sum payment because it is less expensive if you have $ in hand it would be best to pay the lump sum and invest the remaining $ in the stock market   otherwise you invest $ initially pay the loan and end up with $ 0 in three months one might ask what rate of return would the stock market need to yield to make it worth taking the loan the apr proposed by the loan can be calculated    the present value of a loan is equal to the sum of the payments discounted to present value   i.e. with   by induction   so by comparing the $ lump sum payment with $ 997 over 3 x monthly instalments the interest rate implied by the loan can be found solving for r if you could obtain per month on the stock market the $ x cash in hand required would be calculated by this is equal to the lump sum payment so the calculated interest is comparable to the stock market rate of return   if you could gain more than per month on the stock market it would be better to invest and take the loan recurrence form solving the recurrence form shows the calculation is equivalent to the loan formula e.g. becomes + 1 = 1 + y p where = pv where in the final month = 0 i.e. when m = 3 compare with the earlier loan formula s = d d 1 + r they are exactly equivalent which is quite interesting because it was n't immediately obvious to me that what the lender charges is the mirror opposite of what you gain by investing the present value can be now be calculated using the formula still assuming the 8 stock market return is per month if the stock market yield is 8 per annum effective rate and if it is given as a nominal annual yield 8 compounded monthly

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

the simplest way to handle this is for you to rent the apartment and sublet to the girlfriend and friend   i 'd split the utilities evenly one third from each   the reason for this is that each of you contribute evenly to generating the utility bills   it 's not like your income makes the water cost more for you    utilities are driven by usage   dividing them other than equally is likely to lead to more problems than it solves   also it seems unlikely that a different apartment would use significantly different water electricity or internet   those are driven by the appliances rather than the size or location of the apartment   only pay more for the utilities if you want something that they do n't   for example maybe you want hbo etc   it would be reasonable for you to pay the entire premium if that 's a luxury that they simply would n't buy    i 'd also divide the groceries evenly if you share and share alike   if you eat separate meals you can buy separate groceries    if the rent ca n't be split evenly but you could afford it alone then you can just sign up for it   if you break up with the girlfriend and/or the friend moves out you 're still fine   you have your fancy apartment and can afford it    the bigger problem comes if you ca n't afford the apartment without both the girlfriend and friend contributing   if so you should probably avoid this situation   it 's fragile   any person leaving would put you in a financially untenable position   you can look for a new tenant to replace your friend but you ca n't exactly rely on getting a new move in girlfriend on demand    neither the girlfriend nor the friend can afford to be on the main lease   in case of emergency or tragedy they could n't replace you as a tenant   that 's why they should sublet   then their obligation is to you not to the landlord    how much apartment would the girlfriend and friend get if you were n't involved   what rents would they pay   that 's probably how much rent they should pay for this apartment   you want a better apartment or a better location   that 's on you    you should only do this if you want to do it   if you want to share apartments with the girlfriend and friend then do so   work out something equitable   if you plan on moving in together to reduce your costs then you do n't sound like you are compatible   obviously there are reasons to move in with the girlfriend aside from costs   why ca n't the friend get his or her own place   the added rent probably wo n't do more than pay for the added room you could get a one bedroom without the friend    that points to an alternative way of calculating the friend 's contribution   the difference between a two bedroom and a one bedroom apartment   that 's the additional cost of the bigger apartment   if the friend ca n't afford that then this might not be a good idea    make sure that you can afford the apartment if one or both of the friend and girlfriend move out   you can eventually replace the friend as the tenant but do n't rely on doing the same with the girlfriend   share utilities evenly   possibly groceries too   the friend should pay at least the added cost of the additional bedroom   do n't expect either to pay more in the new apartment than they would pay without you   you should be the only one on the main lease sublet to them

it can be difficult when all your disposable income is spoken for   your options depend on how good your credit is and how flexible your expenses are   i do n't have all the answers without more details possibly not then   however couple of points of advice paying off that credit card debt and not adding any more to it is your 1 priority   you should make minimum payments to every other debt until you have done that because the interest on it will kill you in the mean time   it is always optimal to pay the maximum to your highest interest debt and minimum to all other debts 11 does n't sound very good on your house loan   you may want to consider refinancing   that is if you can get a lower rate   you may also want to get a longer term loan if you have enough discipline to use the extra income to actually pay off your credit card and then the put it toward the house when the cards are paid off look at options to increase your income at least temporarily   second jobs and such   when your finances are more in order you can back off the debt trap is behavioral   we humans tend to increase our spending until we ca n't any more   but the reason we ca n't spend any more is that we have increased our debt until we have no flexible income   then we are stuck for a long time and have few options the only way out long term is to change our habits so that we do n't increase spending each time we pay down a debt or get an increase to our income   financial discipline is the only way to have financial security   almost always the first step is to pay off credit cards and stop maintaining a balance always pay off every card at the end of each month   then start paying off other debts from highest interest rate to lowest this is a hard challenge and one most of us face at some point in our lives   good luck

i expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here your question needs slight revision in its current form rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company the quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc but we will ignore it for simplicity   the net profit of sales for any firm is equal to   qty x sale price cogs taxes other expenses where cogs means cost of goods sold means sales general and admin costs e.g. cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale now if everything in that equation remains same cogs taxes and other expenditures rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin prices may also rise simply as a response to risking cogs or other expenditures latter may be observed in inflationary environments in such a case the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise

my question is how do you rebuild a home without the money to rebuild the home i thought that was why we paid for insurance the reason that you have insurance is so as to keep the mortgage lender from losing money   that 's why you buy the insurance through the mortgage lender and they get paid   without the insurance you 'd have no home but still have a mortgage   you 'd either have to pay off a mortgage with no house or have to declare bankruptcy to shed the mortgage    you essentially have two paths   if you or the builder suppliers can afford to float the cost you can rebuild the original house   you 'll eventually get the $ and can pay off the builder and suppliers   this may involve taking out a construction mortgage to refinance the original mortgage   presumably the construction mortgage would be with a different lender    the other path is that you can sell the existing property as is and use the insurance and proceeds to pay off the existing mortgage   then you 'd have no house and no mortgage   you start over and buy a house with a mortgage    it 's possible that your insurance payoff is n't enough to pursue either path   then your option is to get the insurer to make a bigger payoff   this may involve suing them   note that you may be able to talk the government into suing the insurer for you   they do have regulators who can review things   if you ca n't get government action there are lawyers who will do the suing and take their fees out of their winnings

this is actually to me an interesting point to note   while the answer is that 's what congress wrote there are implications to note first for many the goal of tax deferral is to shift 25 or 28 income to 15 income at retirement with long term gains at 15 simply investing long term post tax can accomplish a similar goal where all gain is taxed at 15   looking at this from another angle an ira or 401(k for that matter effectively turns long term gains into ordinary income   it 's a good observation and should n't be ignored

by the time you 've earned the income it is basically too late to decide who it belongs to   if the assets belong to one person income from those assets must be declared by that person   if you earn interest on a shared account you must declare 50 of it each   and so on   if you 're tempted to fudge it bear in mind that banks report to the ato about interest paid and account ownership i do n't think family tax benefits are taxable income but i do n't get them myself so i do n't know what you can do is think about how you want things arranged going forward   that means making a prediction about who will have the higher income it sounds like that 's going to be you and she will be working at most part time therefore she should hold anything that generates taxable income bank accounts etc and you should hold anything that generates losses negatively geared investments charitable deductions etc   you could look into making a voluntary super contribution into her account which will be deductible for you and get it into a lower tax area if you 're earning on the order of $ 30k per annum in interest you 're looking at paying $ tax on it if it 's in your name vs $ 5k if it 's in hers so it 's not a moot point $ in cash is arguably quite a lot and perhaps you want to look at putting some of it into a low cost balanced managed fund such as those from vanguard   that will be somewhat more tax effective though less stable   if you 're looking to buy a new house within a few years perhaps cash is the best place for it one kind of exception is that if you have a family trust the trust can decide at the end of the year to whom it will distribute its income   however you still have to decide to establish a trust in advance

when you contribute to a 401k you get to invest pre tax money that means part of it e.g. 25 is money you would otherwise have to pay in taxes deferred money and the rest e.g. 75 is money you could otherwise invest base money   growth in the 401k is essentially tax free because the taxes on the growth of the base money are paid for   by the growth in the deferred portion   that is of course assuming the same marginal tax rate both now and when you withdraw the money if your marginal tax rate is lower in retirement than it is now you would save even more money using a traditional 401k or ira an alternative is to invest in a roth account 401k or ira in which case the money goes in after tax and the growth is untaxed   this would be advantageous if you expect to have a higher marginal tax rate during retirement moreover it reduces tax risk which could give you peace of mind considering u.s marginal tax rates were over 90 in the 1940 's a roth could also be advantageous if you hit the contribution limits since the contributions are after tax and therefore more valuable lastly contributions to a roth account can be withdrawn at any time tax and penalty free however the growth in a roth account is basically stuck there until you turn 60 unlike a traditional ira/401k where you can take early retirement with a plan another alternative is to invest the money in a normal taxed account   the advantage of this approach is that the money is available to you whenever you need it rather than waiting until you retire   also investment losses can be deducted from earned income e.g. 15 25 while gains can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate e.g. 0 15 the upshot being that even if you make money over the course of several years you can actually realize negative taxes by taking gains and losses in different tax years finally when you decide to retire you might end up paying 0 taxes on your long term capital gains if your income is low enough currently for a single person the biggest limitation of this strategy is that losses are limited to per year also this strategy works best when you invest in individual stocks rather than mutual funds increasing volatility aka risk lastly this makes filing your taxes more complicated since you need to report every purchase and sale and watch out for the wash sale rules side note you should contribute enough to get all the 401k matching your employer offers   even if you cash out the whole account when you want the money the matching typically should exceed the 10 early withdrawal penalty

so does a post dated check have any valid use in a business or    personal transaction does it provide any financial or legal    protections at all yes most definitely you 're writing a future date on the check not past to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day keep in mind that this may change from place to place since not every country has the same rules in the us for example such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation however in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it while in the us the date on the check is the date on which it was supposedly written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date for example in canada if you write a post dated cheque under the clearing rules of the    canadian payments association cpa your cheque should not be cashed    before the date that is written on it if the post dated cheque is cashed early you can ask your financial    institution to put the money back into your account up to the day    before the cheque should have been cashed

first off you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is safe meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations   your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough   that rules out things like stock market investments secondly you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money   if you have an emergency odds are you do n't want to be waiting around for weeks months years for the money to become available   this rules out most fixed term investments bonds traditional cds etc if you are concerned that you will need near instant access to your emergency money then you probably want to keep it in a savings or money market account at the same bank as your checking account   most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly unfortunately your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the savings mma far below the inflation rate   this means your money will slowly lose value over time   be prepared to keep contributing to it for most people being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days < 1 week is sufficient   worst case you charge something on your credit card and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives if money within a few days is okay for you there are a few options money market mutual funds not to be confused with a money market account this is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund   these are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account   an example of such a fund would be fidelity cash reserves   are not fdic insured so they are not exactly zero risk   however they are considered extremely safe   they almost never go down in value only a few times in the past few decades and when they have the fund manager or the federal govt stepped in to restore the value   they usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account and are available in taxable and non taxable varieties online high yield savings or money market account these are a relatively new invention   it 's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers but it 's online only   no local branch means low overhead so they offer higher interest rates 2.0 vs 0.5 for your local bank   some of them used to be over 5 before the economy tanked   like your local bank it is fdic insured one bit of caution   some of these accounts have become lately   they have started to do things like promo rates for a few months only offering the high interest rate on the first few $ k deposited limiting the amount that can be withdrawn etc   be sure to read the details before you open an account no penalty cds certificates of deposit usually offer a better rate than a savings account but your money is locked up until the cd term is up e.g. 36 months   if you need to cash out before then you pay a penalty   some banks have begun to offer cds that you can cash out with no penalty at all   these can offer better rates than the savings account   make sure it really is no penalty though   also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time   this can be an issue if you want to deposit $ 100 from every paycheck rewards checking accounts these are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate 3 or more provided you generate enough activity   most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month   if you can stay on top of the requirements these can be a great deal   if you do n't stay on top of it your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful though personally we use the online high yield savings account for our emergency fund   i 'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use   the best deal changes almost week to week   instead i will say to check out bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and cds that you can sort   the bank deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

another vote for a bigger downpayment for the reasons benjamin mentions also from experience i would save up at least a small pile as a separate house emergency fund because you will find things that are wrong and/or that got by the previous owner and it 's probably not going to last past the first few months of home ownership in my case the home inspector missed amongst other things that the shower on the 2nd floor was leaking both into the bedroom and the living room below that added a little unexpected expenditure as you might guess

congrats to your gf   how much depends a lot on how stable her income tends to be if she has stable salary $ 20 k plus $ k in contract work then having a larger ef is important if she has a consistent track record of pulling in $ 35 k each year with contract work then she may still need a somewhat higher emergency fund to tide her over between gigs   the rule of thumb is at least 3 months expenses before you start investing for better returns if she is reliant on contract work then holding up to 6 months expenses could be wise just in case she hits a slow patch with work   after that emergency fund is covered she can look at investment opportunities with varying levels of risk return   i would also recommend putting it down in writing why she 's investing saving is she saving up for an awesome vacation maybe that 's why she really is so far above a normal ef does she want a new car maybe there 's not really so much to spare bottom line assuming her monthly expenses are around $ 2 k per month she might have $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 that she could look to start investing safely

here are a few points to consider taxes as a consultant you will be responsible for the employer portion of the social security and medicare taxes and you might have to pay for state unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as well office expenses as a consultant you may be required to buy your own laptop pay for your own software licenses and buy other office related supplies for higher end services you may be setting up a complete office and even hire your own secretary and other support staff benefits as a consultant you will be responsible for your own health insurance retirement plan and other benefits that an employer would ordinarily provide education your employer will likely pay for books and magazine subscriptions and send you to seminars in order to keep your skills current your client wo n't liability consultants face certain liabilities that employees do n't and have to factor the cost of insuring against those risks into their rate let 's say you 're a software developer and your faulty code causes a nuclear plant 's reactor core to and melt down as an employee you 'll get fired as a consultant you will get sued even consultants in low risk fields can easily shell out thousands of dollars per year for a basic general liability policy sales marketing do n't forget that when your contract ends you will have expenses associated with finding your next client including the opportunity cost of not getting paid for your services during that time all these factors contribute to your overhead which you have to roll into your consulting rate you should also add a margin of profit after all as you 're in business for yourself you should be compensated for taking this entrepreneurial risk    if you 're looking for a quick over the thumb rule you can figure that your equivalent consulting rate should be about twice what you would be paid hourly as an employee assuming you work 2,000 hours a year if you would receive a $ 100,000 salary your hourly rate should be $ 100 of course this is only a very rough guideline ultimately your rate will mostly be influenced by how established you are and how much your services are in demand

if the mortgage is against your primary residence then the only part that 's probably deductible is the mortgage interest   if you pay down your loan principal faster then all other things being equal you 'll get less of a tax deduction because you 'll accrue less interest in the months after you throw a big chunk at the principal the principal is less so the interest is less but do n't worry that 's all right   it 's a tax deduction so your actual tax savings will be only a fraction of the interest you paid so at the end of the day you 'll be saving yourself money

first of all in the u.s. no federal gift tax has to be paid by the recipient of   the gift it is the donor who has to pay gift tax if any is due nor does the recipient have to pay federal income tax on the gift it is not considered taxable income   i do not believe that any states view matters differently for the purposes of state gift and income taxes but i am always ready to be of any such held notions if your parents were required to pay any gift tax that would have been at the   time the gift was originally given and only if they gifted more than the maximum allowable exemption per person for that year currently the exemption is $ 14 k from each donor per recipient per year additional gifts were made by your parents to you during your minority when your parents paid any income tax   due on the distributions in your account but these amounts would unlikely to have been larger than the exemption for that year in any case gift tax is   none of your concern if you have been declaring the income from distributions from the mutual funds all these years then the only tax due on the distributions from the funds in 2013 is the federal income tax for the 2013 tax year plus a special assessment of medicare tax on investment income if your income is large unlikely based on your question and follow up comment   if you sold all or part of your shares in the funds in 2013 then you would need to calculate the basis of your investments in the fund in order to figure out if you have capital gains or losses   ditto if you are thinking of cashing out in 2014 and wish to estimate how much income tax is due but if you want to just hang on to the funds then there is no immediate need to figure out the basis right away though taking care of the matter and keeping in top of things for the future will be helpful as a final note there is no tax due on the appreciation of the fund 's shares the increased value of your account because the fund 's share price rose is not a taxable event nor are decreases in the account deductible these are called unrealized capital gains or losses and you do not pay tax on them or deduct them as losses until you realize the gains by   disposing of the property

will 2 millions dollars check to be cash will a bank convert a check to cash   in my experience no   even for small checks    unless you happen to have a very good relationship with your banker read as have an existing large bank balance    the exception is if you go to the bank the check is drawn on    but even then i doubt they 'll cash a $ 2 m dollar check can you deposit a $ 2 m dollar check   most definitely how long will 2 millions dollars check to be cash depends on your bank 's policies relationship with you and the origination of the check   you 'll need to talk to the exact bank in question to find out   some guidelines from my own experiences out of country checks will take quite awhile say 4 weeks even for trivial amounts   i 'm not sure what a $ 2 m size would do    beyond that situation it will likely depend on whether you have more money than the check 's worth in your bank accounts   if so they may be willing to give you cash in a few days   or if you only want some of the money as cash in a few days that might be possible if the bank could n't cash for him will the bank give him some of cash    for example $ 500,000 for now and the rest wait to be cash at later    time like 24 hours or 1 week unless you already have a lot of money in your relationship with the bank i think it is highly unlikely they will let you have any of the money in 24 hours   you might get some of it in a week    the issue will be that such a large check will be viewed as having a high chance of being fraudulent so they will want to be exceptionally conservative

the card holder agreement does not explicitly specify a minimum spending requirement it does though have the following catch all clause for closing the account we may    cancel your account    suspend the ability to make charges    cancel or suspend any feature on your account and    notify merchants that your account has been    cancelled or suspended    if we do any of these you must still pay us for all    charges under the terms of this agreement we may do any of these things at our discretion even if you pay on    time and your account is not in default if your account is cancelled    you must destroy your cards we may agree to reinstate your account    after a cancellation if we do this we may reinstate any    additional cards issued on your account charge you any applicable    annual fees and charge you a fee for the account one would suspect that american express would happily collect the fee from anyone who holds the card but is not using it in any way someone though that is n't spending the expected amount of money but is availing themselves of the 24 hour concierge service etc would probably find their privileges revoked and/or their card canceled

that 's not the case where i 'm located techs are hired temp to hire on contract they are paid less than permanent employees they are n't given any of the benefits of permanent employees they are just as the article says treated like second class employees even third class at one company i worked for and they are along with we just are n't hiring right now lines and told we 'll extend your contract again and see if we are hiring at the end next time   i was laid off from a full time position because we were bought out by another company i spent 7 months unemployed i got a call for contract work and it only lasted two weeks i was paid significantly less than my previous full time job and was not offered any kind of benefits at all when that contract was up i was offered a contract at another company again i was paid significantly less than i was making before and i was along by that company for two years before another contract offered me more money with that contract i was finally getting paid what i was getting paid at my last permanent position but again i did not receive the same benefits as a full time employee that contract let me go after 18 months due to policy that they could n't string contractors along i was told that i could wait 6 months and be hired again though i then spent four months unemployed until i found my next contract which then hired me full time after 6 months i 've been full time for 2 years here now but who knows how long that 'll last i 've seen companies suddenly restructure which means they bring in   and i ca n't even blame this on me being a low level tech with no marketable skills i 've been in it professionally for just a few months shy of 20 years i 've done everything from technical support to security to software qa to system administration i 'm now in a job specializing in hardware i have a resume that could be pages long with many different skill sets and roles this is typical for nearly all of the contractors i know in this area i run into people i know all the time floating from company to company around here we 're passed around like disposable commodities but mention the word union and you 'll get replaced with the tech industry is shitty that way

well again i think you 're grasping at straws to try to justify monopoly   it 's entirely possible that in a free market there will be some rich individuals who choose to risk it all and hire a small army to attack their enemies or destroy property   but the whole point is that their armies will be far less powerful than the militaries governments currently have and they wo n't have popular acceptance as legitimate   i 'm well aware that anarchy would n't be a cake walk   the only claim i 'm making is that it would be superior to what we currently have a system whereby a monopolist millions of people each year for 1/3 of their income and their children for the first 18 years of their lives   that kind of centralization of power is extremely dangerous   gt;your security will have to be handled somehow do you think calling something a fee perhaps fundamental nature of the payment   of course not   we believe that people should pay for their security voluntarily just like they pay for their food and clothes   most people probably would n't even need security just some cameras a fence and a small gun   some societies are more violent than others naturally   we do n't expect to spring up in a particularly violent society as they tend to property rights anyway   we think its will happen in a first world atheist non violent country like denmark or new zealand   gt;again explicitly how are you going to handle security   i take with the way you 've phrased this   i will not be handling anything   it is up to consumers to decide what is best for them and entrepreneurs to experiment to determine the best way to do things   the market is a system of trial and error like the scientific process   here 's a video of one possible way it could be done

i 'll answer your question but first a comment about your intended strategy   buying government bonds in a retirement account is probably not a good idea   government bonds generally are tax advantaged themselves so they offer a lower interest rate than other types of bonds   at no tax or reduced tax many people will accept the lower interest rate because their effective return may be similar or better depending for example on their own marginal tax rate   in a tax advantaged retirement account however you 'll be getting the lower interest without any additional benefit because that account itself is already tax advantaged buying bonds generally may be a good idea or not i wo n't comment on that but choose a different category of bonds for the general question about the relationship between the fed rate and the bond rate they are positively correlated   there 's not direct causal relationship in the sense that the fed is not setting the bond rate directly but other interest bearing investment options are tied to the fed rate and many of those interest bearing options compete for the same investor dollars as the bonds that you 're reviewing   that 's at a whole market level   individual bonds however may not be so tightly coupled since the creditworthiness of the issuing entity matters a lot too so it could be that bond rates generally are going up but some specific bonds are going down based on something happening with the issuer just like the stock market might be generally going up even as specific stocks are dropping also keep in mind that many bonds trade as securities on a secondary market much like stocks   so i 've talked about the bond rate   the price of the bonds themselves on the secondary market generally move opposite to the rate   the reason is that for example if you buy a bond at less than face value you 're getting an effective interest rate that 's higher because you get the same sized incremental payments of interest but put less money into the investment   and vice versa

the following advice assumes that you have a significant amount already in the account in cash equivalents if you are only talking a few hundred bucks or so then just jump in at the next dip like today 's if you have a larger amount to move into equities the safest approach is to gradually move it into investments over some period of time at regular intervals regardless of what is going on in the market this mitigates the risk of investing it all into an fund that is peaking at the exact moment you buy   so for example you might invest 20 of the total amount each month for 5 months to gradually get into the market the larger the amount you are investing the more you probably want to spread it out but do n't spread it out much further than a year or you are losing opportunity cost by leaving your money in cash type investments with likely a very poor rate of return this strategy is called dollar cost averaging if you want to research it more

is it worth it you state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an s&p500 index   not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them   unless you plan to buy the index itself you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these you are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now   but that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing $ month   no matter what asset you choose to invest in it 's going to take some time to build up to producing $ 20k year income at that rate   investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways given you have some time immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends or other investments on in my opinion   income investors usually focus on yield on cost a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income   if you do go with dividend investing and your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis it 's not unheard of for to be north of 6 in 10 years   the same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly so i assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to i know more about dividend growth investing than i do property investing so i can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 and only then when the company has a long consistent track record of growing eps and dividends at a good rate a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers   amongst many other possible measures   they then buy only on dips or where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal p e at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 + year or longer hold time there are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a $ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years   check out dividend growth investor 's blog for an example   there 's a whole world of dividend growth investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them i want to point out that income is not just for those who are old   some people planned and have achieved the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses    assuming you want that the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that with you or if something else fits you better   i believe the op says they 'd prefer long hold times with few activities once the investment decisions are made and is n't by significant work to identify his investments   both real estate and stocks fit the latter but the of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing which i assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former   in my opinion the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns   post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio   whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

what most of these answers here seem to be missing is that a stock price is not exactly what we typically expect a price to be for example when we go in to the supermarket and see that the price of a gallon of milk is $ 2.00 we know that when we go to the cash register that is exactly how much we will pay   this is not however the case for stocks for stocks when most people talk about the price or quote they are really referring to the last price at which that stock traded which unlike for a gallon of milk at the supermarket is no guarantee of what the next stock price will be   relatively speaking most stocks are extremely liquid so they will react to any information which the market believes has a bearing on the value of their underlying asset almost if not immediately   as an extreme example if allegations of accounting fraud for a particular company whose stock is trading at $ 40 come out mid session there will not be a gradual decline in the price $ 40 > $ > $ instead the price will jump from $ 40 to say $ 20   in the time between the the $ 40 trade and the $ 20 trade even though we may say the price of the stock was $ 40 that quote was actually a terrible estimate of the stock 's current post fraud announcement price considering that the price of a stock typically does not remain constant even in the span of a few seconds to a few minutes it should not be hard to believe that this price will not remain constant over the 17.5 hour period from the previous day 's close to the current day 's open   do n't forget that as americans go to bed the asian markets are just opening and by the time us markets have opened it is already past in london   in addition to the information and therefore new knowledge gained from these foreign markets movements macro factors can also play an important part in a security 's perhaps the ecb makes a morning statement that is interpreted as negative news for the markets or a foreign government before the us markets open   stock prices on the nyse nasdaq etc wo n't be able to react until 9:30 but the $ 40 price of the last trade of a broad market etf at 4pm yesterday probably is n't looking so hot at this morning do n't forget either that most individual stocks are correlated with the movement of the broader market so even news that is not specific to a given security will in all likelihood still have an impact on that security 's price the above are only a few of many examples of things that can impact a stock 's valuation between close and open all sorts of geopolitical events announcements from large multi national companies macroeconomic stats such as unemployment rates etc announced in foreign countries can all play a role in affecting a security 's price overnight as an aside one of the answers mentioned after hours trading as a reason in actuality this typically has very little if any impact on the next day 's prices and is often referred to as amateur hour due to the fact that trading during this time typically consists of small time investors   prices in ah are very poor of a stock 's price at open

i 'm guessing you 're asking about the us please add a location tag to your question   unfortunately you can not claim expenses paid for someone other than yourself or your dependents in irs publication 970 that deals with education credits they give the following guidance expenses paid by others    someone other than you your spouse or    your dependent such as a relative or former spouse may make a    payment directly to an eligible educational institution to pay for an    eligible student 's qualified education expenses in this case the    student is treated as receiving the payment from the other person and    in turn paying the institution if you claim an exemption on your tax    return for the student you are considered to have paid the expenses also you should keep the gift tax in mind your help to your friend is only exempt from gift tax if you pay the tuition directly i.e. you write the check to the school cashier not to your friend if you give the money to your friend it is subject to gift tax which you have to pay in some cases someone who is not family may in fact qualify to become your dependent for that he must live with you in the same household and be supported by you and not have any significant income if that 's the case with you and your friend you might be able to claim him as a dependent and get some significant tax benefits including the education credits consult your tax adviser if its relevant to your situation

thanks for your question definitely pay the car down as soon as possible reasoning to follow in fact i would go even further and recommend the following why 1 make money risk free the key here is risk free by paying down the loan now you can avoid paying interest on the additional amount paid toward principal risk free imagine this scenario if you walked into a bank and they said if you give us $ 100 we 'll give you $ 103 back today would you do it that is exactly what you get to do by not paying interest on the remaining loan principal 2 the spread you might make by investing is not as large as you may think let 's assume that by investing you can make a market return of 10 however these are future cash flows so let 's discount this for inflation to a real 8 return then let 's assume that after fees and taxes this would be a 7 real after tax return you also have to remember that this money is at risk in the market and may not get this return in some years assuming that your friend 's average tax rate on earned income is 25 this means that he 'd need to earn $ 400 pre tax to pay the after tax payment of $ 300 so this is a 4 risk free return after tax compared to a 7 average after tax return from the market but one where the return is at risk the equivalent after tax risk free return from the market think t bills is much lower than 7 you are also reducing risk by paying the car loan off first in a few other ways which is a great way to increase peace of mind first since cars decline in value over time you are minimizing the possibility that you will eventually end up under water on the loan where the loan balance is greater than the value of the car this also gives you more flexibility in terms of being able to sell the car at any point if desired additionally if the car breaks down and must be replaced you would not need to continue making payments on the old loan of if your friend loses his job he would own the car outright and would not need to make payments finally ideally you would only be investing in the market when you intend to leave the money there for 5 + years otherwise you might need to pull money out of the market at a bad time remember annual market returns vary quite a bit but over 5 10 year periods they are much more stable unfortunately most people do n't keep cars 5 10 + years so you are likely to need the money back for another car more frequently than this if you are pulling money out of the market every 5 10 years you are more likely to need to pull money out at a bad time 3 killing off the buy now pay later mindset will result in long term financial benefits stop paying interest on things that go down in value save up and buy them outright and invest the extra money into things that generate income dividends this is a good long term habit to have people also tend to be more prudent when considering the total cost of a purchase rather than just the monthly payment because it feels like more money when you buy outright as a gut check for whether this is a good idea here is an example that dave ramsey likes to use suppose that your friend did not have the emergency fund and also did not have the car loan and owned the car outright in that case would your friend take out a title   loan on the car in order to have an emergency fund i think that a lot of people would say no which may be a good indicator that it is wise to reduce the emergency fund in order to wipe out the debt rather than maintaining both

ultimately you are the one that is responsible for your tax filings and your payments it 's all linked to your ssn after all if this fee interest is the result of a filing error and you went through a preparing company which assumes liability for their own errors then you should speak to them they will likely correct this and pay the fees   on the other hand if this is the result of not making quarterly payments then you are responsible for it source comptroller of maryland site if you do not have maryland income taxes withheld by an employer you can make quarterly estimated tax payments as part of a pay as you go plan if your employer does withhold maryland taxes from your pay you may still be required to make quarterly estimated income tax payments if you develop a tax liability that exceeds the amount withheld by your employer by more than $ 500 from this watered down public facing resource it seems like you 'll get hit with fees for not making quarterly payments if your tax liability exceeds $ 500 beyond what is withheld currently $ 0

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

as previously answered the solution is margin it works like this you deposit e.g. usd at your trading company they give you a margin of e.g. so you are allowed to trade with usd   let 's say you buy pieces of a stock at $ 20 usd fully using your limit and the price changes to $ your profit is 5000 $ 0.50 = $ fast money if you are lucky let 's say before the price went up to it had a slight dip down to $ your loss was 5000 $ 0.2 = wait you had just 1000 to begin with you 'll find an email saying margin call or termination notice your shares have been sold at $ and you are out of business the broker willingly gives you this credit since he can be sure he wo n't loose a cent of course you pay interest for the money you are trading with but it 's only for minutes so to answer your question you do n't care when you have your money back the trading company will always be there to give you more as long as you have deposit left i thought no one should get margin explained without the warning why it is a horrible idea to full use the ridiculous high margins some broker offer 1:10 might or might not be fine but is

in orange county southern california one agent has pretty extensively about using rental parity to determine when it is time to rent or buy rental parity is achieved when the cost of renting is equal to the cost of owning in theory if you buy when a home is selling above rental parity you 're overpaying and you 'd be better off renting he has many posts on the subject a few you might care to read would be this one and this other one you might get a better sense of how to calculate rental parity by looking at an example or two there is also the ny times calculator mentioned in other responses and the calculator be aware the calculators are garbage in garbage out in other words you have to consider the input carefully in particular i found the defaults on the calculator were not realistic so far as i am aware the agent at does not make his calculations public though i have never actually asked he 's using a spreadsheet which i have never seen that is another option if you care to do this kind of analysis yourself search around you can find a spreadsheet that someone has posted here and there but keeping something like that updated is not trivial in my experience in practice it 's difficult to be totally rational and mathematical when it comes to many decisions and as other respondents have noted where you live is one of those decisions too saying buy when rental parity is achieved is sort of like saying buy low sell high as though it were perfectly clear when stocks are at a bottom and/or a peak in our case we bought a house about 12 years ago before rental parity was being discussed in the looking back we supposedly bought at the wrong time according to that agent 's rating system but it turned out fine for us our house has appreciated whereas the s&p 500 is basically where it was 12 years ago had we been thinking in terms of rental parity we might not have bought at that time of course your mileage may vary and hindsight is always 20/20 i think the most helpful advice i can offer was something i got from a real estate agent around the time we were looking he told me when you 're looking at houses be sure you like the floor plan and the location because those two things are not easily changed that advice really helped us to see things more clearly

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

disclaimer i am not canadian and have no experience with their laws and regulations there really are n't any safe short term investment options at the moment with interest rates being close to zero so just put the money aside you will need for the car and the computer maybe on a callable savings account to make at least a few dollars do not take out any loans it is very unlikely you will earn more than the cost of the loan you did n't say how much will be left but unfortunately it really is not much to go on anyway considering that you seem to have enough income to cover your expenses you could transfer the rest to your rrsp invest and just forget about it i suggest to follow this rule of thumb the growth portion of your portfolio which for you means equities should be directly related to the number of years you wo n't need to touch these funds 1 year 0 equity 2 years 10 3 years 20 and so on what 's not in equities you could put in short term bonds meaning an average duration of about 3 years needless to say single stocks bonds are out of question ideally you can find 2 etfs one for stocks and one for bonds respectively however if there is any possibility you did not mention that you could suddenly depend on this money you have to keep your equity exposure and thus your potential earnings low just a humble thought i really do n't know your specific situation my apologies if i 'm out of line often disability means that you are not capable of doing one particular thing anymore i.e. work physically just maybe you would still be capable to do some other type of work maybe even from the comfort of your home that would allow you to generate a certain income and also keep you busy   i hope this helps good luck

i know that there are a lot service on the internet helping to form an llc online with a fee around $ 49 is it to pay them to have an llc or i can do that myself no you can do it yourself the $ 49 is for your convenience but there 's nothing they can do that you would n't be able to do on your own what i need to know and what i need to do before forming an llc you need to know that llc is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections as such it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser i.e. a virginia licensed attorney is it possible if i hire some employees who living in india is the salary for my employees a expense do i need to claim this expense this i guess is entirely unrelated to your questions about llc yes it is possible the salary you pay your employees is your expense you need to claim it otherwise you 'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud what i need to do to protect my company for physical protection you 'd probably hire a security guard if you 're talking about legal protections then again talk to a lawyer what can i do to reduce taxes vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes most of them never deliver though otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing tax planning that is plan ahead your expenses time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc talk to your tax adviser who should be a ea or a cpa licensed in virginia what i need to know after forming an llc you 'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your state annual reports tax reports business taxes sales taxes payroll taxes etc most are the same for same proprietors and llcs so you probably will not be adding to much extra red tape your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this but you can also research yourself on the virginia department of corporations state department whichever deals with llcs

first i do n't claim to have all the answers but can appreciate the dialogue and question you 're posing   as you stated you love the overall advertising experience and i 'm assuming sales generation from those experiences since that is how you 'll generate revenue   integrated marketing to me has always seemed like an especially narrow subject matter i do n't mean that it is simply or easy by any means but rather you become a story teller in the advertising world and your story is to impact your target audience in a particular way i 'll use myself as an example i am a former college athlete and currently work in sales marketing supply chain i watch a lot of sports with my two sons and saw the recent gatorade ad about in order to win you have to lose that ad has stuck in my head because i know that commitment from to school to work it 's a brilliant concept that has me hooked to me that is what is all about a concept that was tailored to tell a story of success through failure and having athletes that repeat that story a truly hand crafted product that now has me opt for a gatorade when leaving the gym    when i consider marketing as a whole i do n't think of these types of tailored situations but rather the whole puzzle marketing and its counterpart analytics create a solid shape for a business to thrive your personal sales lines and how your sales people are performing are a part of your marketing potential customer service to build relations and increase your net promoter scores technical applications to develop products that are in line with customer demand and in turn the supply chain foresight to deliver on said products all of it is marketing    hope this helps

30 year loans usually have higher interest rates you pay more interest over the life of the loan on a 30 year loan a 15 year loan will have higher monthly payments than a 30 year loan 30 year loans are virtually all fixed interest rate loans 10 year loans often are variable interest rates

firstly it is n't so generous   it is a win win but the bank does n't have to mail me a free box of checks with my new account or offer free printing to compete for my business   they already have the infrastructure to send out checks so the actual cost for my bank to mail a check on my behalf is pretty minimal   it might even save them some cost and reduce exposure   all the better if they do n't actually mail a check at all per my bank individuals and most companies you pay using send money will be mailed    a paper check your check is guaranteed to arrive by the delivery date    you choose when you create the payment a select number of companies very large corporations such as telecoms    utilities and cable companies are part of our electronic biller    network and will be paid electronically these payments arrive within    two business days so the answer to your question depend on what kind of bill pay you used   if it was an electronic payment there is n't a realistic possibility the money is n't cashed if your bank did mail a paper check the same rules would apply as if you did it yourself   i suppose it would be up to the bank   when i checked with my bank 's support this was their answer therefore per this answer do personal checks expire us it is really up to your bank whether or not they allow the check to be cashed at a later date   if you feel the check is n't cashed quickly enough you would have to stop payment and contact whoever you were trying to pay and perhaps start again   or ask them to hustle and cash the check before you stop it finally i would bet a dime that your bank does n't pre fund your checks   they are just putting a hold on the equivalent money in your account so you do n't overdraw   that is the real favor they do for you   if you stopped the check your money would be and available edit please read the comment about me losing a dime seems credible

most people on reddit do n't seem to get any system they 're talking about and this is the perfect example    the patent was approved before the sale it takes about 2 years to get a non controversial patent in the us maybe they were in talks for this acquisition 2 1/2 years ago but that 's somewhat unlikely given the timelines for most acquisitions    it would be so far and away more valuable to amazon to prevent a shopper at a competitor from seeing that they could get the same product for 30 less on amazon than to ever prevent someone in their forthcoming brick and mortar empire from doing it   as far as a brick and mortar store goes groceries is also a very low margin one yes they picked the high end market that would be better than your average safeway bi lo or walmart but it 's also a relatively small one compared to the alternatives and i think it 's dumb to expect that to make a difference groceries are the final frontier for amazon as far as making sure they can deliver anything anywhere today it 's basically having cold storage warehouses in every metro area without having to build them    edit yeah there was a missed double negative there obviously it 's in their interest to keep other businesses from preventing people in their stores from realizing they can get things cheaper on amazon

you need to hope that a fund exists targeting the particular market segment you are interested in for example searching for cloud computing etf throws up one result you 'd then need to read all the details of how it invests to figure out if that really matches up with what you want there 'll always be various trade offs the fund manager has to make for example with this fund one warning is that this etf makes allocations to larger firms that are involved in the    cloud computing space but derive the majority of their revenues from    other operations bear in mind that today 's stock prices might have already priced in a lot of future growth in the sector so you might only make money if the sector exceeds that predicted growth level and vice versa if it grows but not that fast you could lose money if the sector grows exactly as predicted stock prices might stay flat though you 'd still make a bit of money if they pay dividends also note that the expense ratios for specialist funds like this are often quite a bit higher than for general market funds they are also likely to be traded less frequently which will increase the bid ask spread i.e. the cost of buying into and getting out of these funds will be higher

i have no idea where you are getting your years from   millennials are typically defined as being born between 1980 and 1996   gen x ends around 1979 and the not yet generation z perhaps suggested by some starts around 1997   of course there is n't full agreement on the start year as you even quoted but it 's typically early 1980s i 've seen 1979 1982 your given start year of 1993 makes no sense   the end year is more up for debate 1996 is very common but i 've seen as early as 1995 and as late as 2000 depending on who you talk to   one common definition of millennials is people who are too young to be gen x but old enough to remember the september 11 attacks   the 18 to 34 range that you quoted was probably written a couple years ago or at least from the mindset of a couple years ago when that would have been accurate   and quoting wiki millennials not that it is a definitive source   gt researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the to early 2000s as ending birth years

i think you are confusing understands technology with is technology guru or technology visionary   gt as i noted the whole timeline simply doesn't match up with reality at all no matter how desperately one the timeline into trying to make it plausible   your timeline is flawed as sony 's early work goes back well in to the 50 's   gt his son by having a patent attorney look at it and then came back and told junior some cock amp bull story about having been beaten to the patent   maybe the whole thing is a lie however the story goes that the patent application was actually filed   gt lol go to any sizeable bar and talk to a number of people ask them if they ever had an idea that was later patented and became a big time thing you 'll end up with hundreds of similar well i had this idea once for stories and a lot of them will come from when they were teens or twenty somethings very few of them have even a tiny kernel of truth   agreed that 's exactly why i 'm saying having the idea is n't important like you said he might have just been working off of some designs he read in a magazine i do n't look at his work with the crt as a demonstration of any particular brilliance just an interest and enough competence to actually get the damn thing to work which already separates him from pretty much all non tech ceo 's and even puts him in a reasonably cloud amongst ceo 's or large tech companies   gt as the apple ceo he was a fish out of water but given that the advertising amp pr people had already once done the let 's dress up our ceo as a technical visionary with jobs they simply did their best to repeat the same thing with even less basis in reality with sculley   you should read jobs own accounts of meeting and recruiting sculley they had very extensive conversations about technology and while jobs no doubt did n't see him as a visionary the computer industry was new to sculley so he had a lot to learn particularly the first year and sculley clearly did n't get jobs design but jobs very much felt he could share his vision and sculley would understand it and its implications similar comments from and others who worked with the guy then   gt and of course subsequently he 's been on and trying to capitalize on that bullshit ever since gt gt he probably should have just gone back to the beverage amp advertising world but by then i think he had begun to believe his own pr myth and his ego just would n't allow for admitting the truth   ironically i think the post apple track record shows quite the opposite sculley definitely sees himself not as a technical visionary or even a but as a master marketer yet the evidence is he has n't done terribly well marketing most of the fairly interesting tech that he 's found out there so i 'm not sure what your basis is for this narrative you 've constructed
# 499336
as others have already pointed out there is no monetary sensible reason to borrow at 5 cost to invest at 1 return however just because it does n't make perfect sense financially does n't mean it ca n't make sense for peace of mind and you should not dismiss the peace of mind argument out of hand ignoring tax effects credit score effects cost of higher levels of insurance required etc and assuming a five year repayment plan borrowing $ 15,000 at 5 will cost you about $ for a total cost of $ 1 interest on the same $ 15,000 would give you about $ in other words your loan premium is $ interest expense about $ on the car loan reduced by interest earned $ on the retained savings plus the capital repayment amount if you were to take the money out of savings you would probably want to replenish that over a similar time period ignoring interest saving $ 15,000 in five years means $ so this boils down to the $ interest premium now consider that the times when an emergency fund is most often needed are very often the times when banks will be reluctant to extend a loan a job loss being a common example while foreclosing on an existing loan can still happen as long as you keep making payments i suspect that most banks are far more willing to overlook the fact that you would not have qualified for the loan after the job loss if a loss of income situation develops after you pay the car with your savings without a loan you start out with $ 15,000 in the bank plus whatever car payments to yourself you have been able to save afterwards depending on when things turn bad for you this could mean that you having only half of the savings that you used to but of course you also have no car payment expense which is the same as you do now if a loss of income situation develops while you are still paying off the car you start out with $ 30,000 in the bank instead of $ 15,000 but run the risk of having to make the car payments with money out of your savings the net result of that is that your savings are potentially effectively reduced by whatever the remaining debt outstanding on the car is which in turn is reduced over time even if you were not to actively save your net financial situation becomes better over time if a loss of income situation develops after you have paid off the car you now own the car free and clear and still have $ 30,000 in the bank assuming that you would repay yourself on a schedule similar to that of a car loan if you took the $ 15,000 out of the bank instead this is a very similar situation consequently the important consideration becomes is it worth it to you to pay $ extra to have an extra $ 15,000 on hand if something happens to your financial situation i have been in pretty much exactly the same situation albeit with smaller amounts and determined that having the cash on hand was worth the small additional interest expense not the least of which because i was able to secure a loan at a pretty good interest rate and with no early repayment penalties you may reach a different conclusion and that 's okay but do consider it

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

you can explain things in more detail with more thorough examples links references and diagrams on your site this question just happened to be something i was thinking about recently   you could also cover the tax consequences of capital gains on tax free bonds since i expect they are treated the same as other capital gains term and are not tax free   edit my additional explanation of why municipal bonds are tax free in addition to federal bonds is clunky perhaps you can approach it more concisely

in my experience dealing with credit cards and store cards you may find that the store card is much more flexible than the credit card in terms of the enforcement of the card agreement   for instance i 've missed payments on credit cards and only been 1 day late and saw a rate increase but on a store card when the same thing happened it was like they did n't even notice   granted this was a 100 store card with no visa mc logo on it and it was through their bank this may not be true of all store cards and your experience may differ but i felt like the store card was more of a tool for acquiring the merchandise and helping the store make a sale than it was for some big bank to make money off of my interest with credit cards you are the product and the bank makes money purely from interest the store on the other hand makes money from selling the product and credit helps increase sales my suggestion is to avoid credit altogether as all debt is risk but if you must use credit you may have a better experience with the store card of course do n't forget to consider the interest rates payment plan and other fees that may apply as they may affect your decision in terms of which to go with

the projects are expensive because they are technically challenging   the point is that bart an existing public transit system has no money for infrastructure investments because it 's spent on employee benefits gross salary overtime and pension benefits     paying a janitor $ 100k in any locality is ridiculous and that includes the bay area   a private corporation such as facebook does n't pay their janitors $ 100k   they contract the labor out to a company who pays $ 20/hr and they hire another employee instead of paying 1.5x or overtime

as michael pryor answered a bond fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds i 'd also consider an etf based on bonds to be a bond fund but i 'm not sure that all investors would consider these as bond funds not all bond funds are the same just like stock funds you can classify bond funds based on the issuer of the bonds you can also classify funds based on the time to maturity in general bond funds have lower risk and lower expected return than stock funds sometimes bond funds have price movements that are not tightly correlated to the price movements in the equity markets this can make them a decent hedge against declines in your equity investments see pryor 's answer for some info on how you can get tax free treatment for your bond fund investments

i respectfully disagree with eric   if you invest from day one in a roth where exactly will taxable income come from to put you in a higher bracket at retirement i agree maybe for other reasons than you list that early on post tax is the way to go because i 'll assume that one starts work in a lower bracket there 's probably a majority who start work in the 15 bracket but over time work their way to 25 as they grow to 25 using the pretax 401(k and ira can keep them at 15 for some number of years in any year of low income for whatever reason they can convert the pretax money to roth to top off the 15 bracket   to bring the point home if you went post tax the whole way imagine retiring with $ 2 m in the roth but no pretax money you now have a standard deduction exemption and the full 10 bracket each and every year gone to waste money you paid 25 tax when you could be paying zero on some of it the deduction and exemption add to $ in 2012 and the 10 rate applies to the first $ of taxable income if you do the math this is $ 17,500 and if you plan a 4 withdrawal rate you 'd need pretax money to give you the each year last all three factors standard deduction exemption and bracket limits all rise a bit each year an increase of $ 200 is another $ 5000 to save pretax   edit 2013 brought the ability to convert within one 's 401(k from the traditional pretax side to the roth side this makes possible turning 100 of one 's 401(k money to roth and retiring without the of the standard deduction exemptions etc

volume is really only valuable when compared to some other volume either from a historical value or from some other stock   the article you linked to does n't provide specific numbers for you to evaluate whether volume is high or low many people simply look at the charts and use a gut feel for whether a day 's volume is high or low in their estimation typically if a day 's volume is not significantly taller than the usual volume you would n't call it high the same goes for low volume if you want a more quantitative approach a simple approach would be to use the normal distribution statistics calculate the mean volume and the standard deviation anything outside of 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations either high or low could be significant in your analysis you 'll need to pick your own numbers 1.5 or 2.0 are just numbers i pulled out of thin air it 's hard to read anything specific into volume since for every seller there 's a buyer and each has their reasons for doing so the article you link to has some good examples of using volume as a basis for strengthening conclusions drawn using other factors

i 'd answer it this way   what do you want to do i 'd say any amount is acceptable from as low as $ 100   when you look at the specific tree of investing paying $ 5 for a $ 100 seems unacceptable   however when observing the forest what does it matter if you waste $ 5 on a commission   your friends and maybe you probably waste more than $ 5 multiple times per day   for them buying a latte might empower them if buying another share of hd for a similar cost you than do it   in the end who will be better off studies show that the more important part of building a significant investment portfolio is actually doing it   rate of return and the cost of investing pales in comparison to actually doing it   how many of your peers are doing similar things   you are probably in very rare company if it makes you happy it is a wonderful way to spend your money

to expand on the comment made by you 're looking to take a short position   a short position essentially functions as follows   here 's the rub you have unlimited loss potential   maybe you borrow a share and sell it at $ 10   maybe in a month you still have n't closed the position and now the share is trading at $ 1,000   the share lender comes calling for their share and you have to close the position at $ 1,000 for a loss of $ 990   now what if it was $ 1,000,000 per share etc to avoid this unlimited loss risk you can instead buy a put option contract   in this situation you buy a contract that will expire at some point in the future for the right to sell a share of stock for $ x.   you get to put that share on to someone else if the underlying stock price were to instead rise above the put 's exercise price the put will expire worthless but your loss is limited to the premium paid to acquire the put option contract there are all sorts of advanced options trades sometimes including taking a short or long position in a security   it 's generally not advisable to undertake these sorts of trades until you 're very comfortable with the mechanics of the contracts   it 's definitely not advisable to take an unhedged short position either by borrowing someone else 's to sell or selling an option when you sell the option you take the risk because of the unlimited loss potential described above

congratulations   it sounds like you 're off to a good start   establishing credit history and starting a roth ira now and getting some investment in at this point is likely to save you a great deal later on   a good way to diversify investments in a roth ira is to use etfs especially index funds which bundle a whole bunch of diverse investments together into one symbol that you can get into with a single transaction fee commission   as a small piece of advice if there 's inaccurate information on that credit card e.g. balances due and payments made showing up on your credit report do n't ask the credit bureaus to correct that data as long as the rest of the information shows generally good standing they 'll just remove the whole thing    if you have the discipline to pay off your credit card balance in full every month and view credit card purchases as electronically spending cash you could consider applying for a credit card of your own to help build that credit history further    also welcome to this site feel free to check it out as you learn more planet money might also have some interesting ways to learn about these topics   finally do n't forget to regularly let your parents know how much you appreciate all they 're doing for you

it might be reasonable or it might be their error    right now you have their assertion that they overpaid    so the range of outcomes runs from them collecting $ 0 to the full amount they assert   you are in a negotiation now get your mind in this game if they demonstrate to your satisfaction that they overpaid you should pay   if the reason is not convincing well can they collect it   if there is a final pay then that s their last shot to do it internally   is the amount in question more than the pay when you were hired you may have authorized them to make correction withdrawls from direct deposit   i do n't know if your new orders to your bank override this   if this is a risk ask the bank for a new account and close this one     did you already sign exit interview paperwork that may ask you to do certain things like not work for a direct competitor release and hold them harmless or not discuss the company publicly if not then   there are two negotiations in play and it is fair to ask in for your signature to settle any potential overpayment claims for $ 0 or as the money now stands   do they do this to other people who leave

i am interested in seeing what happens to your report after you test this but i do n't think it 's possible in practice would not affect your credit score and also would n't be worth it for you to carry a negative balance like that having a -1 credit utilization essentially means that you are lending the credit card company money which is n't really something that the credit card companies do they would likely not accept an agreement where you are providing the credit to them having credit is a more formal agreement than just i paid you too much this month even if your payment does post before the transaction and it says you have a negative balance and gets reported to the credit bureau like that this would probably get flagged for human review and a negative credit utilization does n't really reflect what is happening credit utilization is how much do you owe amount of credit available to you and it 's not really correct to say that you owe negative dollars carrying a negative balance like that is money that could be invested elsewhere my guess is that the credit card company is not paying you the apr of your card on the amount they owe you if they are please provide the name of your card they probably do n't pay you anything for that negative balance and it 's money that 's better used elsewhere even if it does benefit your credit score you 're losing out on any interest each month you could have earned with that money to get maybe 1 2 better rate on your next home or car loan when will that be   tldr i think credit utilization approaches a limit at 0 because it 's based on the amount you owe and you do n't really owe negative dollars i am very interested in seeing the results of this experiment please update us when you find out

gt the system is designed   would n't that be more the union is designed why not just end the union 's contract entirely and hire from outside the union or find a different union to negotiate with maybe someone wants to form a union of teachers who want to teach that focuses on job security for the best teachers not the longest serving   i mean if i was negotiating for myself i 'd want merit based pay increases rather than seniority based i 'd probably also be asking that my health benefits be the same as the district administration i might ask for a clause saying that i ca n't be fired unless all worse performing teachers have already been fired yeah about measuring that have n't figured that out yet i might also ask for some sort of third party policy for representation in the event that there 's a need to lawyer up under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists between myself and the district   the last of those the lawyer issue i 've been told by at least one teacher that they feel that 's the primary service the union provides they hate the contract negotiations because they always seem to go to threats to strike before being resolved   i guess it just seems weird to me that once a union has formed the union has a monopoly on providing the services you 'd think that some could join the union while others could choose to operate independently if the advantages of being in the union outweigh the advantages of being independent then you 'd expect everybody to join a 51 vote to unionize seems like a terrible reason to bring the rest of the employees and any new hire along for the ride it should be an individual 's choice to be represented by the union and whether to accept the union terms or negotiate on their own

tax questions require that you specify a jurisdiction   assuming that this is the us you owe federal income tax at the special long term capital gains tax rate on the net long term capital gains total long term capital gains minus total long term capital losses and so yes if these two were your only transactions involving long term holdings you would pay long term capital gains tax on $ = $   many states in the us do n't tax long term capital gains at special rates the way the federal government does but you still pay taxes on the net long term capital gains i suspect that other countries have similar rules

for starters like some other people have said just talk to someone in ib and get some advice on how to break in and what it 's really like i 've spoken to people in ib and learned that it 's really just not going to be for me in response to your four questions   1   get your degree at depaul and wait a few years to get your masters you do n't need an mba for ib and it 'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network   1 it definitely would n't hurt for you to double major in cs but if you do you 're going to have to keep your grades up and still stay sharp in both majors you do n't want to have a 3.0 and have both it 'll kill your chances you 're going to need at least a 3.8 if you 're under that it 's gon na be a lot harder to get anywhere    1 if there are other industries you want to turn to then sure i used to be interested in ib but now i 'm leaning more towards private equity and working with reg d. clients 1031 exchanges etc    1 network if you are n't already seriously get out there and network like hell but do n't just cold call random people you really need to make meaningful connections with people and continue to stay in contact with them you can also learn a lot from wso and various ib books guides etc i have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it    and some general   do n't stress about the school you go going to a prestigious school really does help but if you work hard enough make the right connections and are good at what you do you can land a role in ib i know several people that have gone into ib from my school and i would consider us maybe a grade c state school it 's possible   i 'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle mark companies rather than your bulge bracket banks it 'll have less competition and could be easier to break into and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into ib but if you ca n't get into ib right after school do n't fret go somewhere get some experience get your certifications series 7 series 63 etc and try again   know your technicals you need to be able to walk through a dcf an lbo and all of the financial statements in an interview there are billions of guides on how to do this but you need to know this   stay on top of current events just be well versed in how the market is doing which industries are hot right now and what 's not and why   know your story believe it or not but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important i have a friend that did n't make it into a certain firm solely because they just did n't think he was a good enough fit for their culture i want to make a lot of money wo n't work instead think more along the lines of i want to challenge myself   good luck man

i am a flight attendant on a private jet and i hear a bank ceo    discussing a merger or a buyout i proceed to purchase that stock    before the announcement the ceo did not tell me to buy it i just    overheard him if you are a flight attendant on a private jet that is operated by one of the principals probably including a bank attorney consultant broker etc in the merger or buyout then you probably have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the information and are prohibited from trading please see you ’re a janitor at a major company you hear members of the company ’s    board outside the room you ’re cleaning and decide to hide in    the closet the board a deal to sell the company for a fat    premium to the current share price you load up on the shares illegal    insider trading definitely this is not a public place and you ’d be in a position to    understand that confidential information was being disclosed which    changes the calculus says andrew a chicago based    securities lawyer also see however between these two extremes of a bystander with no duty to the    corporation and a corporate officer with a clear duty to the    corporation stood a whole group of people such as printers lawyers    and others who were involved in non public transactions that did not    necessarily have a duty to the company whose securities they traded    to address this group of people the courts developed the    theory the theory covers people who    inside information and who are prohibited from trading on such    information because they owe a duty to a third party and not the    corporation whose securities are traded yours is the perfect example you owe a duty to your employer to operate in its best interests as for the broader more common example where you information in an elevator restaurant in line at the coffee shop etc trading on such information was found not to be insider trading in sec v.   in this case mr. overheard information at a track meet and traded on it with profits the court found   the information was inadvertently overheard by at the track meet rule does not bar trading on the basis of information inadvertently revealed by an insider on the basis of the above findings of fact and conclusions of law the    court orders judgment in favor of defendants

well perhaps have a dedicated tax advisor is an answer then i    would n't have thought of this as it 's not specifically about    taxation is it or more broadly consult with a dedicated    professional for the situation in detail yes that is the only real answer you can get anything else will vary between highly localized to entirely incorrect pensions are rarely defined benefit anymore and not many countries still keep state sponsored defined benefit pension plans for most what 's left is social security system which is in no way a pension this is an insurance and is paid as tax which is rarely refundable but you wo n't always have to pay it if you 're a foreigner in the country usually social security benefits are only available to citizens and in some rare cases residents of that country so it is unlikely although possible that you 'll benefit from social security payments of more than one country some countries have treaties that make your social security payments in one count in the other if you 're in a country that has such an agreement with the netherlands you 're lucky your personal pension savings are basically tax deferred investment accounts but tax deferral in one country does n't necessarily work in another in the us you have 401k or ira accounts but in your own country they may very well be taxable so you gain the tax deferral in the us but if your own country taxes them you lost the benefit and you will still have to abide by the us tax rules when taking the money out if you do n't plan properly you can easily be hit by double taxation in such cases bottom line you need to plan your pension savings on your own privately with a good and solid tax advice and pension planning advice that would be relevant to all the countries that you are tax resident at at any given time you can easily be resident for tax purposes in more than one country these advisers have to take into account the laws of the countries involved the tax treaties between themselves and between them and the country of your citizenship   and the future countries you 're planning on visiting or getting old at its complicated and most likely you wo n't be able to predict everything especially because the laws and treaties tend to change over time

understand your own risk tolerance and discipline from moneychimp we can see different market results   this is a 15 year span containing what was arguably one of the most awful decades going a full 10 year period with a negative return yet the 15 year return was a cagr you 'd net after long term cap gains your mortgage is likely costing ~4 or 3 after tax this is not applicable to my canadian friends i understand you do n't deduct interest in my not so humble opinion i 'd pay off the highest rate debts first unlike the david followers who are happy to pay off tens of thousands of dollars in 0 interest debt before the large 18 debt and invest at the highest rate i 'd get long term the problem is knowing when to flip from one to the other   here 's food for thought the david insists on his use of the 12 long term market return the last 100 years have had an average return but you ca n't spend average the cagr the real compound rate was why would he recommend paying off a sub 3 loan while using 12 for his long term planning all my david remarks are not applicable to canadian members you all probably know better than to listen to us entertainers   i am retired and put my money where my mouth is the $ 200 k i still owe on my mortgage is offset by over $ 400 k in my 401(k the money went in at pretax has grown over these past 20 years and comes out at 15 to pay my mortgage each month no regrets anyone starting out now and taking a 30 year mortgage but putting the delta to a 15 year mortgage payment into their 401(k is nearly certain to have far more in the retirement account 15 years hence than their remaining balance on the loan even after taxes are considered even more if this money helps them to get the full matching which too many miss   all that said keep in mind the market is likely to see a correction or two in the next 15 years one of which may be painful if that would keep you up at night do n't listen to me if a fixed return of 4 seems more appealing than a 10 return with a 15 standard deviation pay the mortgage first   last if you have a paid off house but no job the town still wants its property tax and the utilities still need to be paid if you lose your job with $ 400 k in your but have a $ 200 k mortgage you have a lot of time to find a new job or sell the house with little pressure from the debt collectors   to answer the question in advance joe at what mortgage rate do you pay it off first good question i 'd deposit to my 401(k to grab matching deposits first and then if the mortgage was anywhere north of 6 prioritize that this would keep my chances at near 100 of coming out ahead

what teachers have is not ridiculous stop blindly accepting what the media is throwing at you what teachers have is the right to a due process when they are being evaluated that 's all    why try this the next time you assert pseudo free market principals into education at least take into account the fact that unlike a free market schools can not hire anybody to teach simply because you want to someone on wall street can hire literally anyone they want based simply on the idea that they 're convinced the person can do the job   not in education the people demand that a teacher go through literally years of classes observations training and tens of thousands of dollars to earn their credential in other words if you were a principal and you stumbled across somebody that you were convinced would make an excellent teacher you could n't hire them   there is no free market system in education because the people have demanded standards for what qualifies someone as a professional teacher   here 's the point what kind of people would jump through all those hoops to become a teacher or or policeman without something to protect what they 've earned we 're already losing record number of teachers because of the bullshit that comes from letting politicians run our schools take away union protections and they 'll be leaving in droves   what 's fucking ridiculous is a public that wants no child left behind performance at a fraction of what they paid forty years ago

gt 1 what exactly happens when i deposit $ 1000 to the bank does it lend to other parties $ 900 of what i have given them   yep   gt or it turns my whole deposit into their reserve then borrows $ 9000 from the central bank and lends this sum to their customers   no the bank ca n't loan more money than it has in deposits note that this does create money because in this example the bank loaned someone $ 900 but it still owes you $ 1000   gt 2 what happens when i 'll make final payment on my loan   is this a different example or are we assuming your original $ 1000 was loaned to you   regardless every time you make a payment on a loan the bank can re loan that money to someone else   gt does the bank also pay its base to the central bank + base interest rate and keeps only their interests   the central bank has not been involved in this transaction so it does n't receive anything   gt does the central bank remove from the circulation money it received back   yes but i think you 're switching topics   a central bank 's transactions are more about managing the money supply and inflation of a fiat wiki   ideally a central bank trades a bank 's paper assets for reserves adding or subtracting to the bank 's ability to issue loans

i would be surprised if a bank cared about an undergraduate major usually such things are only important if it is a professional degree like a law degree or medical degree the big issue is that if you are not a us citizen a us bank would be unlikely to make an unsecured loan because you could just return to your country and on the loan and they would have no way to collect therefore a bank in your own country might be more logical if you get accepted by a top ivy school they all have financial policies that will allow you to attend regardless of how rich or poor you are so if you are applying to a top school harvard princeton mit stanford yale and get accepted they will fully finance your attendance the only exception is if a they find out you lied about something or b your parents family are wealthy and they refuse to pay anything as long as neither of these two things is true all of the schools listed guarantee they will provide sufficient financial aid princeton even has a no loan policy which means not only will they fund your attendance they will do so without you having to take on any loans

i would go to the bank and just express the concern that the check sent to you might not fully clear you do n't want to spend it until you 're sure it cleared i 'd ask for a manager to tell you when it will clear then confirm after that date that it 's cleared with the same guy   perhaps someone in the industry can explain how long the bank has before deciding the check is bad 10 days 2 weeks really it should either clear or bounce by the second night   i 'd not risk doing this for anyone anyone i know personally can cash their own check and i 'd not get involved with anyone i do n't know on a financial matter like this edit see littleadv comment below good checks clear fast a forged check has time for the victim to go to the bank and challenge the signature and cashing of the check the victim can have 60 days to do this that 's the issue i am wrong the bank manager could n't confirm the check was good so soon

before you decide on moving into trading whether you have experience or not you need to sort out a couple of questions how much do you really understand about the markets   how much money you have and what would be the maximum loss you may be able to take   what supporting eco system you have to help you in terms of trading i.e. hardware software research connections who can provide you with solid information and sorts of it are you really prepared to take on institutions who have billions to spend and take losses i.e. amounts which might break you will be peanuts for them i am assuming you are in us so this website   may help you a bit trading websites where you can open an account   even if you reply in affirmative to the above questions you should still be wary about making money by trading it is a field where even the best people have been in the face without any mercy and above all do n't expect any person will take mercy on your hard earned cash they will take you to the cleaners if they have to there are some websites which allow you to participate in trading not involving real money try that out and see where you get to that should give you some pointers on where you are headed   and realize that it is human nature to assume when you hear news that such and such trader make loads of money in such and such trades trading is easy unless you do it for yourself the truth is such traders would be on their desk for 18 20 hours at a stretch 6 7 days a week without a life to make such money and they have loads of support staff i.e. analysts it guys who makes it easier for them do you have such help if no then look the other side   but giving up without trying at all will be but do it in limits which you can bear and not to get carried away when things are good

that is called substitution of collateral and yes it can be done but only with consent of the lender the best case for this kind of maneuver is if the second house is larger and more valuable than the first another possibility is that you have two mortgages on the first house and none on the second and you want to move the second mortgage on the first house to the second one effectively making it a first mortgage in these instances the lender has a clear incentive to allow a substitution of collateral because the second one is actually better than the first one the potential problem in your case is if the second house were more expensive than the first house you could not use the sale proceeds of the first house as to buy the second house without borrowing additional money in that case a possible solution would be to go back to the lender on your first house for a larger mortgage with the proceeds of that mortgage being used to retire the earlier mortgage depending on your credit payment record etc they might be willing to do this

most of the information we get about how a company is running its business in any market comes from the company if the information is related to financial statements it is checked by an external audit and then provided to the public through official channels all of these controls are meant to make it very unlikely for a firm to commit fraud or to cook its books in that sense the controls are successful very few firms provide fraudulent information to the public compared with the thousands of companies that list in stock markets around the world   now there is still a handful of firms that have committed fraud and it is probable that a few firms are committing fraud right now but these companies go to great lengths to keep information about their fraud hidden from both the public and the authorities all of these factors contribute to such frauds being black swan events to the outside observer   a black swan event is an event that is highly improbable impossible to foresee with the information available before the event it can only be analyzed in retrospect and it has very large impact the classification of an event as a black swan depends on your perspective e.g. the enron collapse was not as unexpected to the enron executives as it was to its investors   you can not foresee black swan events but there are a few strategies that allow you to insure yourself against them one such strategy is buying out of the money puts in the stocks where you have an investment the idea being that in the event of a crash due to fraud or whatever other reason the profits in your puts would offset the loses on the stock this strategy however suffers from time and loses a little money every day that the black swan does n't show up thanks to theta decay   so while it is not possible to detect fraud before investing or at least not feasible with the resources and information available to the average investor it is possible to obtain some degree of protection against it at a cost whether that cost is too high or not is the million dollar question

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

if you have a lump sum you could put it into a low risk investment which should also have low fluctuations right away to avoid the risk of buying at a down point   then move it into a higher risk investment over a period of time   that way you 'll buy more units when the price is lower than when it 's higher usually i hear dollar cost averaging applied to the practice of purchasing a fixed dollar amount of an investment every week or month right out of your salary   the effect is pretty minimal though except on the highest growth portfolios and is generally just used as a sales tool by investment councilors in my opinion

if they 're not matching and their profit sharing has nothing to do with how much you invest then i 'd say do n't bother with the company 401k at all   if you need to at least have an account open to get the profit sharing then contribute the bare minimum having your retirement account through your company forces you to follow their standards choose from their funds use their broker etc   it also means that when you leave the company you either have to move your money anyway or else have an account through a company you do n't work for which i would n't feel all that comfortable doing anyway if you open a retirement account through your bank or a private financial planner then it 's yours and you can contribute what you want when you want and buy the securities that you want   your account executive is there to service you not your company

depends on how far down the market is heading how certain you are that it is going that way when you think it will fall and how risk averse you are   by better i will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital if you are very certain the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put   if you can borrow some money to buy even more puts you will make even more   use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today 's prices   but remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor   a short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage   the of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required   futures trade in large denominations so think about how much you are able to put to risk the inverse etfs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above   the levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward   you can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower directly short selling an etf or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky   on par with the inverse etfs

summary the fees used to differ but no longer do fees are the same if you have a personal account feel free to upgrade it to premier to get access to more features longer answer the two account types used to differ but that changed a few years ago maybe circa 2011 paypal wants person to person payments to be free except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments originally paypal required merchants to have premier or business accounts and charged fees for payments made to those account types personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments but did not pay fees upon receiving payments   eventually paypal the question of is this a person to person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services from the paypal account type so now the same account can receive both a p2p payment e.g. splitting lunch costs on which it will not pay fees and can receive a payment for goods or services e.g. from a web checkout on which it will pay fees regardless of the account type

do n't be afraid to shop around every couple of years when it 's time to renew my auto insurance i call a couple of places to see if i can get a better deal it 's especially important to do this as you get older because your rates go down assuming you keep a clean driving record also as your life changes e.g. if you get married move buy a home get a new car etc at 30 my rates dropped a lot when i bought a home i qualified for a discount by combining my home and auto insurance through the same carrier my suggestion would be to call 3 insurance companies for quotes all on the same day you 'll need to be able to identify the car you 'll be insuring for the most accurate quote do you belong to any organizations that offer insurance discounts e.g. my college alumni association had a program with one of the larger carriers that had the best rates on that i could find

i can see where you are coming from but with that logic then apple spent all that time and money to develop and market the iphone 8 just to use it as an expensive marketing device and i do n't buy that if they did do that however it would have made more sense for them to increase the storage slightly and keep the price of the iphone 7 the same and then release the iphone x. that way they would have a little more profit from the 7 since cost of production is cheaper now that it is a year old and consumers can either have the newest iphone and shell out for it or have an iphone that still works great and now comes with more storage now if they called the iphone 8 the iphone i think there would n't be such a negative image about it in terms of it being a rather small upgrade because the s iteration usually is just a spec bump and no one would bat an eye at that but since it got the title of being the 8th iphone people expect more from it

if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate you can always make money buy it when it 's cheaper and sell it when it 's more expensive if you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently then you do n't know what it will do next most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first   but you do n't know when they 'll move lower or higher   so how could you figure out if you 'll make money you ca n't know dca will on average make you better off unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes but it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases this is true of many investment disciplines such as rebalancing they are all based on averages   if the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using dca but when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day you 'd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day no way to know in advance   degree of volatility should n't matter any fluctuation is enough for dca or rebalancing to get you ahead though it 's true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger since there 's then more difference between dca and a lump purchase   i think the real reason to do dca and rebalancing is risk control they reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day and they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant

typically there are three ways an acquisition is financed what is used is called the consideration   1 cash existing cash on the balance sheet is used think of it like purchasing something with your debit card   2 stock this a bit more complicated the acquiring company issues new shares and exchanges those shares for shares of the because new shares are issued this can have a effect on the stock price of the acquirer however it can have an accretive effect if enough value between the two companies is realized and/or expected   3 debt basically like taking out a loan    the consideration for a deal is often reported as you read in your article   most deals are a combination of cash stock debt debt is often referred to as cash i.e. if you take out a loan you are essentially receiving cash     when it comes to which is best to use there are quantitative analyses for that with a specific focus on the acquirer 's eps earnings per share post deal   the factors that are considered are the forgone interest on cash the additional interest gained from taking on debt and the effects of issuing new stock there is no right answer for which is best as there are multiple different factors and circumstances involved across m&amp;a deals each company has different borrowing rates and value expected from their deals one big factor is the timing and stock price of both companies during the deal if the acquirer is trading at an all time high and the is at an all time low then perhaps an all stock deal would be advantageous to the buyer    typically companies want to avoid stock deals because they are the most

please clarify your question what do you mean by loan in greece if you are referring to taking a mortgage loan to purchase residential property in greece there are two factors to consider if the loan originates from a greek bank then odds are likely that the bank will be nationalized by the government if greece defaults if the loan is external i.e. from j.p. morgan or some foreign bank then the default will certainly affect any bank that trades maintains euros but banks that are registered outside of greece wo n't be nationalized so what does mean for your loan you will still be expected to pay it according to the terms of the contract i 'd recommend against an adjustable rate contract since rates will certainly rise in a default situation as for property that 's a different story there have been reports of violence in greece already and if the country defaults imposes austerity measures etc odds are there will be more violence that can harm your property furthermore there is a remote possibility that the government can attempt to acquire your private property unlikely but possible you could sue in this scenario on property rights violations but things will be very messy from that point on if greece does n't default but just exits the euro zone the situation will be similar the drachma will be weak and confidence will be poor and unrest is a likely outcome these are not statements of facts but rather my opinion because i can not peek into the future nonetheless i would advise against taking a mortgage for property in greece at this point in time

since all the other answers thus far seem to the risk likelihood of the money being seized i figure i may as well make my comment an answer unless you happen to have your legal team travelling with you and your suitcase of cash you should expect that you 'll be questioned extensively so that any sign of in your answers or anything you say that does n't make sense to the officer will be used as an excuse to seize your money and you 'll learn an expensive lesson in civil asset forfeiture the government will file a complaint against your money leading to a ridiculously named case such as united states v. $ in u.s. currency worth noting that while the outcome in this case was not in the government 's favor in the vast majority of cases the government keeps the cash between 9/11 and 2014 u.s police forces have seized over 2.5 billion dollars in cash without search warrants or and returned the money in less than 10 of cases   that last link is kind of a long read but contains cases where people with completely legitimate money and documentation for their money had it seized anyway and were only able to recover it after months or years in court

of course the rationale is exactly the same as always profit is taxed the fact that you use intermediate barter to make that profit is irrelevant to clarify as it seems that you think it makes a difference that no money changed hands consider this situation so far your cost is $ 10000 how will the tax authority address this they will look at the fair market value of the barter you got gold worth of $ 20000 so from their perspective you got $ 20000 and immediately exchanged it into gold what does it mean for you that you 're taxed on the $ 10000 gain you made on your product x the $ 20000 worth of barter that you received minus the $ 10000 worth of work material expenses that you spend on producing the merchandise and that you have $ 20000 basis in the gold that you now own if in a year when you plan to sell the gold its price drops you can deduct investment losses if its price goes up you 'll have investment gain but for the gain you 're making on your product x you will pay taxes now because that 's when you realized it sold the and received in return something else of a value

when investing in index funds index fund as the name suggests invests in the same proportion of the stocks that make up the index you can choose a index fund that tracks nyse or s&p etc you can not select individual companies generally these are passively managed i.e. just follow the index composition via automated algorithms resulting in lower fund manager costs is it possible to establish an offshore company yes it is possible and most large organization or high net worth individuals do this its expensive and complicated for ordinary individuals one needs and army of international tax consultants international lawyers etc but do i have to pay taxes from the capital gains at the end of the year yes canada taxes on world wide income and you would have to pay taxes on gains in canada note depending on your tax residency status in us you may have to pay tax in us as well

i do n't know where you live but $ 12 is an awful lot for a burger fries and soda   i do like five guys and eat there three or four times a year but it is too expensive   i live in the southwest and there are lots of small family owned mexican restaurants here   one of my favorites runs a $ 5.75 lunch special   last time i was there it was en su   that 's something between a soup and a stew with chunks of beef beans and bacon   it is served with fresh tortillas chopped onions rice beans and a basket of chips with salsa   all made right there   it is a more substantial meal and better tasting   at nearly half the price   the local italian place has a $ 5 lunch special   you get a salad bar and either a 12 pizza or a bowl of   again all from scratch   there is a good sit down restaurant that is excellent too   entrees with soup or salad and bread run $ or so   this is why i think $ 12 for a burger and fries is too expensive   it does n't compete with better products   you can feed two people better food for about the same amount or have lunch at a fine restaurant for the same amount

disclaimer i am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert this page on the hmrc site lists several pages that appear to be relevant starting with foreign currency delayed remittances and on to foreign currency example which seems pertinent to your case paraphrased a property bought in 1983 is sold for a taxable gain in one tax year but the proceeds can not be released remitted to the uk until later by which time currency fluctuations have created a second taxable gain the size of the first gain selling the property is determined by the exchange rate in effect at the time of the sale but because of local restrictions this can be deferred   the size of the second gain currency movement is determined by the change in exchange rate between the time of the sale and the time of conversion in your case the first gain was actually a loss so i believe you should be able to use this to offset any tax due second gain   this page states that losses can be claimed up to four years after the end of the tax year in which they were incurred so you are probably still ok the example makes application under to defer the gain made on the original sale because of the inability to transfer funds but as i understand it this is primarily to avoid a tax liability in that year   since you made a loss on the sale there would n't have been a tax liability so there would be no need to defer it

for 3x it 's about 114 and for 4x 144 which naturally is twice 72   these are close back of napkin results with smart phone apps offering scientific calculators you should get comfortable just taking the root of a number for a more precise answer   update in response to brick 's comment the rule of 72 says that to double your money it answers both questions how much time do i need given a rate and how much return do i need given a time   logic tells me that if 72 is the number to double 144 is the but i 'm a math guy and my logic might not be logical to op so   let 's take the 20th root of 4    this is the key to use 4 hit key 20 equals the result is or and this is the precise rate you 'd need to quadruple your money in 20 years now 20 = which rounds to 144 rule of 144 to quadruple your money   this now answers op 's question how to derive a rule of x for a return other than doubling   one more example i want 10x my money of course i need the initial guess to enter one calculation people like 8 in general it 's a bit below the 10 long term s&p return and a good round number the rule of 72 says 9 years to double so 18 years is 4x and 36 years is for my initial calculation i 'll use 40 years the root of 10 i get again the precise rate that gives 10 fold over 40 years and multiplying this by 40 i get a rule of 237 which i 'm tempted to round to 240   at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = 9.99 at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = you can see that you lose some accuracy for the sake of a number that 's easier to remember and manipulate 72 to double is pretty darn accurate so i 'll stick with rule of 237 to get 10x my money    to close the purpose of these rules is to create the tool that lets you perform some otherwise tough calculations away from any electronic device of course i know how to use logs and in real life i 'm paid to explain them to students who are typically glad when that chapter is over i 've shown above how the rule of x can be formulated with a power root key which for most people is simpler ironically log calculations as offered force a continuous compounding which may not be desired at all it would give a result of 230 for my 10x return example and the following using the first equation he offered at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = which is further away from the desired 10x than my 237 or rounded 240

the safest investment is probably a money market fund originally i said a tips fund but they appear to be riskier than i had thought   but you might not want to invest everything there because the returns are not going to be great   high returns come with high risk the best portfolio has some percentage which may be 0 of your money in a safe asset like a money market and some in a risky portfolio this percentage may also be zero for some people   you should consult your own risk aversion and decide how much money to put in each   if you are super risk averse put almost all of it in the money market   if you want a little more return put more of it in the risky portfolio   this is a fundamental result of finance theory what 's the risky asset   a fully diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks   people do n't agree on exactly what the weights should be   the rule of thumb back in the day was 60 stock and 40 bonds   these days lots of financial planners recommend 120 minus your age in stock and the rest in bonds   but no one really knows what the perfect weights in the risky portfolio should be the rules of thumb i just gave have little or no theoretical foundation so you have to choose for yourself what you think makes sense

edit i think it 's a fairly straightforward cause amp effect   you tax the transactions it lowers the incentive to do frequent trading   so yes i do think it would limit it effectively   i 'm under no illusion that speculating will end   but i think we need to dial it back a bit so that investment is the primary driver in the market not gambling   i 'm not anti speed but the markets serve a real purpose   they allow for liquidity amp for useful capital allocation   and liquidity is nothing if all the machines are set to sell sell sell   this is what caused some of the crashes   also we had liquidity prior to all this high frequency trading   i 'm unsure that the added liquidity makes up for the cons of turning an investment engine into a gambling engine   you do nt even have to believe me   there are a few big time investors that say they are out of the market because it is no longer governed by reason

so my question is this in reality is investment in equities like the    stock market even remotely resemble the type of growth one would    expect if investing the same money in an account with compounding    interest generally no as there is a great deal of volatility when it comes to investing in stocks that is n't well represented by simply taking the compounded annual growth rate and assuming things always went up and never went down this is adding in the swings that the market will take that at times may be a bit of a rude surprise to some people are all these vastly underestimating how much savers    need to be socking away by overstating what is realistic in terms of    growth in investment markets possibly but not probably until we know definitively what the returns are from various asset classes i 'm not sure i 'd want to claim that people need to save a ton more i 'll agree that the model misses how wide the swings are not necessarily that the averages are too low or overstated

yes you are right as per my understanding while doing trade you must consider specially for starters like me the volume of the stock you are trading in should be high enough to keep you secure for quick in and out whenever the bid volume is more than the ask volume the prices will move up and vice versa to give an example if a stock is at 100 points and there are bids the transaction will occur when either the bidder agrees to pay the ask price case 1 he pays 101 his bid offer will disappear and the next best ask will be 102 and the current price will be 101 which was the last transaction or when the person giving ask price agrees to deal at best bid which was 99 in which case the share will go down

it certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency   and yes if the bank makes some bad loans it can the problem generally this does not happen though   remember that banks usually have lots of customers and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day so there is usually enough on hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day   they also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default   a bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit making activity e.g. issuing loans and satisfying its account holders in the event of a major withdrawl demand there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency there are regulations that specify a reserve requirement   the bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand so they ca n't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once   regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation if a bank does run into trouble it can take out a short term loan   either from another bank or from the central bank e.g. the us federal reserve   banks do n't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do so if they are regularly borrowing money they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly if all else fails and the bank ca n't meet its obligations e.g. the fed loan fell through the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid   in the us this is what the fdic is for   worst case the bank goes under but your money is safe these protections have worked pretty well for many decades   however during the recent financial crisis all three of these protections were under heavy strain   so one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing   these tests showed that some banks did n't have enough money in reserve   not long after banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money loan it out invest it etc the current financial landscape would change considerably

as others have addressed the legality in their answers i want to address the idea of the dealership being a middleman a dealership serves more of a purpose than just a car to a consumer actually they consume a great deal of risk let 's remember that a dealership is really an extension of the oem albeit independently owned and operated the dealership must still answer to the brand they represent if people have a bad experience with a dealership a customer might go to another of the same brand but more often than not they will go to the competition out of spite therefore it 's in the dealership 's best interest to represent the brand as best as possible but unfortunately that does n't always happen   while the internet has made a certain part of a salesman 's role null and void and since this is a finance read money q a site let 's take a moment to consider the risk assume and therefore the value added by a dealership test drive a car is a huge purchase and while it 's okay to buy a pair of shoes online without trying them on a car is a bit different of course we want to make sure it fits before we shell out several thousand dollars yes you meaning consumers can look at car pictures and specs online but if you want to see how that vehicle handles on your town 's roads if it fits in your garage and/or driveway then you need to take it for a test drive it 's not feasible for to have millions of people showing up to car plants for a test drive right scalability aside some business that is handled in automotive plants are confidential and not for the general public to know about a dealership provides an opportunity for those who live locally to see and experience the car without flying or driving wherever the car was assembled they provide this at a risk banking on the fact that a good experience with the vehicle will lead to a sale service a car is a machine and no machine is perfect neither will it last forever without proper service a dealership provides a place for people to bring their vehicles when they need to be serviced let 's set aside the fact that the service prices are higher than we 'd like because the fact remains most of it is skilled and labor that the majority of people do n't want to do themselves trade ins it is not in an best interest to accept a vehicle just to sell you another vehicle especially if that vehicle is from another brand dealership 's assume this risk and often offer incentives to do so hoping it will lead to a sale that trade in was an asset to you but is a liability to them because they now have to liquidate that trade in just so that you can purchase a car sure you could sell your car yourself and now you would assume that risk what if your car is not in perfect shape or has a lot of miles for it 's age would it do well in the used car market what if it takes too long to sell and you miss that memorial day car sale at the dealer this might be okay for some but generally speaking most people would rather avoid the risk and trade it in at the dealer toward the purchase of a new car rather than the headache of selling it themselves i 'm sure there are more but those are the one 's that immediately sprung to mind just like starbucks there are terrible dealerships out there and there are great ones and very few of us venture to farms and just for fresh coffee beans

do you want to split expenses of the new apartment or split your income assets equally too as for instance with a marriage where no sort of yours mine and ours are split out i 'm going to assume you have beliefs similar to me in my answer in that you desire to split expenses of the new place but do n't suddenly want to split all of your assets and income 50/50 too so here 's how i 'd approach this i am somewhat unsure of what you mean by living expenses for your flat does this mean the cost of ownership per month what it takes to not get rid of the place and no portion of this is interest mortgage to make the calculations a little simpler i 'll assume that all the money you pay out as expenses is just gone none of it remains as equity or is dis proportionally accumulating value in some other such way so you move in with your girlfriend the cost for her place the place itself taxes utilities whatever is per month so since you are both getting equal use of the place you would split this into 3946 per month for each of you that 's it well i do n't see how that really matters at all anymore than if you owned a company or stocks and bonds if you rent it out for less per month than it costs you i do n't see why your girlfriend should take any part of the loss conversely if you make more money per month than it costs you that is your investment profit the payment you get for owning the apartment and dealing with renting it out now if your girlfriend is going to partner with you in handling renting out the apartment you own and you want to look at this as an investment partnership then you should pay all expenses out of the income first and then you can split the profit if you really want one question to ask would be what if you just sold your apartment completely would you give your girlfriend have the money from the sale if not then i do n't see why you would split the investment profit from holding on to the place while this is what i recommend and would feel comfortable with personally and if the situation was reversed and it was my girlfriend that owned a place and was moving in with me ultimately this is about your personal values beliefs and relationship you are very wise to seek something that both of you will find fair and so you should discuss a proposed arrangement with your girlfriend and see if you are on the same page if you are both fine with the agreement and feel ok with it then great none of us have to like or agree with it because we are n't a part of your relationship psychologically and financially this situation seems the most reasonable to me but ymmv after some more thought and from comments i realize that it 's probably best to explore a few possibilities numerically so i 'll run a few sets of numbers which may help pick which one is right for your relationship this is approximately the same as paying her rent for getting to live with her you pay her for sharing her place splitting the expense 3946 paid to you she pays the other 3946 for her place financially it 's like being room mates you can do whatever you want with your place rent or sell hold on to it for security etc this deal makes your girlfriend financially better off by 3946 the financial advantage to you is wholly dependent on what you do with your place   this option would give you each the most financial independence which is why i like it but you might be keen on being more interdependent   which leads us to the next option here you behave as before in splitting her expenses but you include renting out your place as part of the deal let 's say you get 10k a month for it you pay the expenses on that place from the rent then you have left as profit you split the profits monthly to each of you   there 's a bit of problem here though what happens when the place is vacant do you share the full expense of the rent so she 'd actually be paying you each month while it sits open what about repairs taxes costs and credits etc   i would recommend instead what you do if you go this way to account for the apartment as an investment and do n't pay out any of the profits right away all rents stay in their own account and you pay expenses from that same account for you both it 's like it does n't exist accept it is a nice earning asset when you decide it has accumulated more than enough to pay for itself and has enough money to cover vacancy repairs etc then when you pull out money for the duration you are together you just pay it out to both of you equally you might also pull this equity out and spend it on something for both of you like a nice vacation etc something you both enjoy so you are still sharing the profits i do n't object to this and it could be a nice arrangement i would only note that this makes you have a personal relationship you live together as roommates and now you are co landlords business partners that 's a lot of types of relationships and i can tell you from personal experience each type has it 's own stresses and this sort of stress can stack or if you do n't handle it well multiply so just make sure you are both clear what sort of responsibility you are really both signing up for up front and what you 'd do if you part   combine your apartment expenses which would equal so that 's cost to each of you a month if you rent your place then whatever money you get you split and whatever costs come up repairs cleaning etc you would also split so if you get an average of 10000 a month for the apartment you each are paying living expenses of total   but notice that this is n't exactly equal either you will pay less per month than you are now and she will pay less than she was before   there 's nothing morally wrong with this or anything it 's a 100 partnership across the board yet advantage is still not equal you actually will see a larger benefit to your budget than she will but if you seek equal benefit you will have to pay a month more than she does   this sort of thing is basically the model marriage uses a pure 50/50 partnership or communal property and note that one of you will either be paying more than the other will be benefiting more than the other no matter what you do it 's impossible to balance both costs and benefits because your income and expenses are not the same going in if you go this way you 'll need to choose what is most important splitting the expenses income equally or benefiting financially equally so i say again ultimately you have to choose based upon your individual and shared values and also on just what sort of relationship and layers of commitment you want to have together you could start slow with option 1 then progress to sharing more that 's what i 'd recommend because i like the idea of developing things one layer at a time rather than jumping in head first like i have personally done in the past haha once bitten twice shy i might just be more risk averse or careful than you desire to be but that 's a personal choice   i personally believe the relationship can be far more valuable than any investment but at the same time i 'll take $ 1 over a relationship that has turned sour any day of the week this is why i suggest the more gradual careful approach to let your love bloom and grow deeper one layer at a time without the complexities of fully shared finances or investment partnership relationships are hard enough so this is why i favor trying to protect them aggressively from unnecessary complexity some favor the sink or swim model of seeking out trials and challenges while i favor the relationship as tender growing model i hope seeing these options laid out more is helpful to you and good luck to you your relationship and lastly to your investments

having recently been given basically the same question it hinges on a few major factors what does your apartment provide e.g. heating internet etc my personal example with my numbers which includes taxes insurance estimates minor repairs to home as needed also ignoring all costs that are shared e.g. food internet car insurance etc i am only making a difference around $ 450 per month in 5 years i would save $ 450 12 5 $ 27,000 however i also have to pay costs for buying the house transfer deed fees home inspections etc which in my case cost around $ 3000 not to mention selling a home has some costs i think around $ 1500 + in my area as well as the taking a cut which i also think is around 2.5 = $ so we can probably estimate you would lose around $ 15000 at most buying and selling the home when all final costs come in which means in my case i would at most be saving around $ 12,000 probably less assuming i did not miss anything so basically 5 = $ 200 per month saved tldr i do n't think its worthwhile because there is a lot of risks involved and houses tend to require a lot of extra work money with apartments you have little no risk and can freely leave at the end

i do n't quite understand your thought process here   first in a tax advantaged retirement account you are not allowed to engage in a transaction with yourself    if you just want to run a business and be able to write off expenses how is using the self directed ira relevant you can either buy the condo using your tax advantaged account and rent it out to regular tenants   or you buy the condo yourself using your own money and then operate your business so you can deduct business expenses from doing so   401k 's allow you to take a loan out of it so you can look into that as well

the odd thing about primary school education that i hear from talking to teachers is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide or even state wide in the case of texas decision for which program to use for reading they generally include a set of books or single book with a sequence of things to be taught teacher 's who 've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material they might refer to them by names but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material when one teacher says to another i used $ x to supplement the required $ y it 'd be like a software engineer saying i used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case there 's a fair amount of baggage in the statement but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made   as to the master 's in reading there 's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the education departments at state schools a large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level they tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you 'd find in other subjects including mba take these classes part time and summers over the next 3 years and if you pass them all we give you a piece of paper that says masters of education reading or similar it comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something   gt basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them   i actually doubt that it 's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching some work some do n't the structure of the system discourages unfortunately and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied

i can think of one major income source you did n't mention dividends   rather than withdrawing from your pension pot you can roll it over to a sipp invest it in quality dividend growth stocks then depending on your pension size withdraw only the dividends to live on the goal here is that you buy quality dividend growth stocks    this will mean you rarely have to sell your investments and can weather the ups and downs of the market in relative comfort while using the dividends as your income to live off of    the growth aspect comes into play when considering keeping up with inflation or simply growing your income    in effect companies grow the size of their dividend payments and you use that to beat the effects of inflation meanwhile you do get the benefit of principle growth in the companies you 've invested in    i do n't know the history of the uk stock market but the us market has averaged over 7 total return including dividends over the long term a typical dividend payout is not much better than your annuity option though 3 to 4 is probably achievable    although looking at the list of uk dividend champion list companies that have grown their dividend for 25 years continuous some of them have higher yields than that right now    though that might be a warning sign btw given all the legal changes around buy to lets recently increases stamp duty on purchase reduction in mortgage interest deduction increased paperwork burden due to right to rent laws etc you want to check this carefully to make sure you 're safe on forecasting your return

just read the book flash boys by michael lewis   it describes this process in detail albeit a bit more dramatically than it has to   basically what hfts high frequency traders do is they set up their line to the exchange so its microseconds faster than everyone else   then they test out the market with tiny orders seeing how fast it 's getting filled if these are getting filled immediately it probably means there 's a big order coming in from an investor   so the algorithm and it 's all algo based obviously because no human can remotely hope to catch this will detect that as soon as there 's a spike in volume it will buy all of the volume at the current price and sell it back for higher forcing the big investor to take on higher prices     another case is that some hfts can basically buy the entire trade book from an exchange like nasdaq   so every time someone places a market order for 200 shares of a 6.5 stock the hft will see it buy up all the current stock from say 6.5 6.6 and sell it back at 6.7   not rocket science if you already get info about the trade coming in in fact this is basically market making but performed by an evil hft instead of a trustworthy bank     but honestly there are a lot more ways to make money from hft than front running which is n't even possible anymore because exchanges no longer sell their books to hfts

you have several issues at work if in the next few years you have a leak in the roof that causes another insurance claim they may decide not to cover it because they already paid you to replace the roof and it is your fault that it was n't that might also mean they do n't pay you for the stuff that is damaged because of the new leak if you minimize the claim that may make it less likely that they will drop you in the future or increase you rate next year but if you do n't return the excess funds they will evaluate you on the larger claim size of course if they are sending the money directly to the repair company they will only pay the bill up to a maximum amount usually the issue has been that the repair company wants to do a larger repair the dispute resolves around some aspect of the building code i had a car repair that had to be increased because the roof damage was within x inches of the windshield so the windshield had to be replaced the insurance company eventually agreed but it slowed down the process for a couple of days because they wanted to measure it it is possible that the insurance company has rules related to the age of the roof and the amount of damage that triggers a total replacement

it is possible to consolidate mortgages with nationwide in some circumstances quote from their website it is possible to consolidate different mortgages and other debts such as personal loans and credit cards however it does depend on your individual circumstances including the exact type of loans you want to consolidate and whether you are still in a special deal period i personally would be amazed if you could n't get them all in one mortgage without changing provider but i would n't be at all surprised if they forced you to have this one mortgage as a new mortgage rather than adding balances to an existing one my reasoning is as follows coming at it from a different angle whatever there was that required your further borrowing to be in new mortgages rather than added to your existing mortgage will also preclude your multiple mortgages being added to one of your existing mortgages

no they certainly are not compensated the same way   some are paid by commission that they earn from the products they sell ie certain mutual funds insurance etc   others are paid for their advice based on an hourly fee or a percentage of the portfolio you have to invest this is a great question because too many of us just assume that if someone is in the business they will give trustworthy advice   this may certainly be the case but think about it the financial planner at your bank who also is a mutual fund specialist just flip that handy business card over is employed by bank x.   bank x sells mutual funds gic 's insurance all kinds of great products   that bank x employee is not likely to tell you about products from bank z down the street that might be a better fit for you find a fee based planner someone you can pay by the hour for advice and let them help you review products across the industry   it 's like asking your bank for mortgage advice they will discuss the options they offer but may not tell you about a deal down the street   using a mortgage broker helps you find the best deal across the board i believe the current issue of magazine has an insert discussing planners   their magazine and website are good sources of reliable canadian financial advice

more costs are going to be put on the consumer but that is something that would happen all the time originally those systems were not built with the expectation that average life expectancy would jump from almost a factor of a third 60 to 80 years if you wonder why the age of retirement is 65 and not more or less check out and kaiser on that subject additionally the current age population pyramid of the west and asian soon to come is put an increasing pressure on the cost of healthcare   now to me the biggest issue with the us is the belief that market driven economies will always lower prices the problem is that the insurance companies in this country form an oligopoly with the goal to make profits now here is the important question is healthcare a need or a want if it is a want then someone can live without it but if you have an accident or anything of that type then is it still a want or a need you can live without tv all your life and nothing bad may happen to you no healthcare and then you can get screwed for your life   because people will feel compelled to save themselves and be brought to the hospital those who can afford it or need it will pay for it thus you have an automatic pressure on prices as it is used by a smaller pool of people than if everyone in the country was paying for it independent of income and because the people buying health insurance feel they need to have insurance their price elasticity of demand will become inelastic the price may change a lot but the amount of demand wo n't change much so if i 'm a private insurance company i will charge as much as i can because i know that people will be willing to pay more for   the same healthcare cost    the european system will simply be a cheaper option than the us because it concentrates a larger pool of payers and is not aimed at profits additionally if there were quality issues in the healthcare provided this would have been seen long ago if you compare the amount of money spent in the us and europe on healthcare in europe the cost of healthcare is theoretically only the government spending in the us it is both and private spending     tell me what you think

firstly you mean resistance not support as a support is below the current price and resistance is above the price secondly using a ma as support or resistance would mean that that support or resistance level would move up or down as the price moved up or down and would not be static at $ 25 generally stocks will range trade more often than they will be trending either up or down so a stock can be range trading between a support and resistance levels for months and even years and usually the longer it range trades for the bigger the outbreak either up or down will be when it does happen using a ma especially shorter dated ones as support or resistance or as a up or down trend line works better when a stock is already trending up or down when a stock is moving sideways it will tend to keep crossing above and below the ma and you will be if you try to use them as your trigger for entry in these situations compare the two charts below   in the first chart the stock is up trending for over 6 months and the ema is being used as a support or up trending line as long as the price does not break through and close under the ema then the uptrend continues you could use this ema line as a means of entering the stock when prices move towards the ema and bounce off it back up again or you could use it as your stop loss level so if price closes below the ema line you would sell your position   in the second chart the stock has been range trading between the support line at about $ and the resistance line at about $ for 10 months in this case the price has been moving above and below the ema during these 10 months and you may have been many times if you were trading each break above or below the ema a better strategy here would be to buy the stock as it approached the support line and bounces up off it and then close and reverse your position go short when the price approached the resistance line and bounces down off it   edit when range trading you would have your stops just below the support line when going long and just above the resistance line when going short that way if it does break through support or resistance and starts trending you will be covered so this shows that different strategies should be used when a stock is trending to when it is range trading mas are better used as entry signal during an established uptrend or downtrend than when a stock is range trading
