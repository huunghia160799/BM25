this is also an opinion the iphone makes up too much of the company 's total revenue   last quarter results were very well received because of the somewhat dramatic increase in service revenue indicating that maybe the company can shift from relying so heavily on the iphone   as it stands apple is a single product company and that hinders long term prospects hence the relatively low multiple and the company has missed estimates in fact one of those large dips was an earnings miss   additionally if you 're looking at the charts another one of the recent dips was likely caused by the brexit vote because everything was for a couple of days after that

this is an opinion but i think it has more to do with the market 's uncertainty about the long term future of the company without steve jobs   apple has n't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since jobs passed and while some people would argue about the apple watch jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death so that does n't really count whether you like or hate apple you had to admire jobs passion and creativity and there 's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the jobs vision over the long haul   my guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the no column but only ever so slightly   the company continues to deliver fantastic results but how long will that last of their next products do n't wow consumers the way previous ones have   this skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower p e than it deserves to but this is just my opinion    i hope this helps good luck

you linked to an article about 1 quarter in 2010   gt;if companies pay their employees more for the same amount of output it will just drive up the cost of goods leaving us with the same shitty demand   gt;also how do you figure this   i figure this because it is the simplest economics the cost of goods sold is based on 3 things   1 raw materials 2 labor including associated costs such as payroll taxes and benefits and 3 overhead   if 2 is increased with no increase in output the cost of those goods is going up

i do n't know why your comment got downvoted because it 's perfectly sensible my only issue with extending the sol is what basis to use when determining what the statute should be i 'm sure there is or at least was a perfectly logical reason for setting it at 5 years i do n't have the idea of what the basis was mind you but i 'm sure there was one that being said extending the statute for future crimes solely because the prosecutors let it run out this time strikes me as being on shaky footing

so if i understand the investment program here you have $ 100 of tax withheld from your salary at the end of jan feb mar until december   this withholding is in excess of the expected tax for the year you use the appropriate h&r block product to file your taxes and h&r block gets your refund of $ 1200 on march 1st   h&r block adds 10 and give you e cards for $ on the face of it this represents a return of per year compounded monthly however there are a few wrinkles that might make the scheme less inviting you 'll get a receipt for miscellaneous income from h&r block and pay tax on the earnings the quoted return is only realized if you can use the e cards immediately   if they sit around for a while then they are n't earning any interest   if you sell them for cash at a discount if you even can   then this reduces the return   if you do n't cash them at all they 're a total loss this offer was announced on jan 15 2015   so you ca n't go back and put it in place for 2014   and if you set it up for withholding in 2015 is there any guarantee that it the same offer will be in place when filing in 2016

actually the part is interesting because they actually are n't middlemen just faster buyer 's and sellers on the open market they just buy what one person is selling and sell it to someone else who is at the same time looking to buy so i guess the issue is the same time is n't the same for all parties concerned on the other hand both buyer and seller can set limits on the bounds of the price and only transact when someone meets their terms if you are willing to accept whatever the market will bear then it seems like you should be ok with getting it

this answer is about the usa each time you sell a security a stock or a bond or some other asset you are expected to pay tax on the net gain it does n't matter whether you use a broker or mutual fund to make the sale you still owe the tax net capital gain is defined this way gross sale prices less broker fees for selling + cost of buying the asset the cost of buying the asset is called the basis price   you or your broker needs to keep track of the basis price for each share this is easy when you 're just getting started investing it stays easy if you 're careful about your record keeping   you owe the capital gains tax whenever you sell an asset whether or not you reinvest the proceeds in something else if your capital gains are modest you can pay all the taxes at the end of the year if they are larger for example if they exceed your wage earnings you should pay quarterly estimated tax the tax authorities ding you for a penalty if you wait to pay or six figure tax bills without paying quarterly estimates   you pay net capital gains tax if one asset loses money and another makes money you pay on your gains minus your losses if you have more losses than gains in a particular year you can carry forward up to $ 3,000 i think you ca n't carry forward tens of thousands in capital losses   long term and short term gains are treated separately irs schedule b has places to plug in all those numbers and the tax programs turbo etc do too dividend payments are also taxable when they are paid those are n't capital gains they go on schedule d along with interest payments the same is true for a mutual fund if the fund has ford shares in it and ford pays $ per share in march that 's a dividend payment if the fund managers decide to sell ford and buy tesla in june   the selling of ford shares will be a cap gains taxable event for you   the good news the mutual fund managers send you a statement sometime in february or march of each year telling what you should put on your tax forms   this is great they add it all up for you they give you a nice consolidated tax statement covering everything dividends their buying and selling activity on your behalf and any selling they did when you withdrew money from the fund for any purpose    some investment accounts like 401(k accounts are tax free you do n't pay any tax on those accounts capital gains dividends interest until you withdraw the money to live on after you retire then that money is taxed as if it were wage income if you want an easy and fairly reliable way to invest and do n't want to do a lot of tax form scrambling choose a couple of different mutual funds put money into them and leave it there they 'll send you consolidated tax statements once a year download them into your tax program and you 're done you mentioned riding out bad times in cash   no no not a good idea that investment strategy almost guarantees you will sell when the market is going down and buy when it 's going up that 's sell low buy high it 's a loser not even warren buffett can call the top of the market and the bottom   ned johnson fidelity 's founder definitely ca n't

hey buddy i like how you echo the same bs the top 1   time to educate you with some simple math using arbitrary numbers to explain my point    top 1 has $ 1,000,000 bottom 80 has $ 1000   i say bottom 80 because it is effectively top 1 next and remaining 80    top 1 tax     --&gt $ 1,000,000 = $   bottom 80 tax    --&gt $ 1000 30 = $ 700   $ gt $ 700   do you see the problem     sure the rich pay $ in taxes compared to $ 300 for the bottom 80   however the wealth is still greatly disproportionate even after taxes   hence why the wealth gap is increasing year over year    edit the tax rates and are the numbers for 2015 assuming not much has changed since i am using $ 1,000,000 and $ 1,000 as arbitrary representations of wealth for better understanding the issue

prices are adjusted for return and not payout   so if you take the ratio of the close price and the adjusted close price it should remain constant the idea behind a total return is to give you a feeling how much money you would have needed back then to reach the price today under the premise that all distributions dividends spin offs etc are reinvested instantly and that reinvestment does n't cost anything

the is from the merchant   to protect themselves a merchant requires payment before giving you your purchased item service that is why you are charged immediately   when getting a refund the same reason applies the merchant needs to ensure that you are returning the correct item or that it is still good or that you are not trying to defraud the merchant in some way once the merchant processes that refund it is all over for them and they have no recourse later if they find out they were cheated that is why they wait a while the delay gives them time to discover any problems

to avoid i state up front that this answer is applicable to the us europeans asians canadians etc may well have quite different systems and rules you have nothing to worry about if you pay off your credit card statement   in full on the day it is due in timely fashion on the other hand if you routinely carry a balance from month to month or have taken out cash advances then making whatever payment you want to make that month asap will save you more in finance charges than you could ever earn on the money in your savings account but if you pay off each month 's balance in full then read the fine print about when the payment is due very carefully it might say that payments received before 5 pm will be posted the same day or it might say before 3 pm or before 7 pm est or noon pst etc etc etc as joetaxpayer says if you can pay on line with a guaranteed day for the transaction and you do it before any deadline imposed by the credit card company you are fine   my bank allows me to write electronic checks on its website but a paper check is mailed to the credit card company the bank claims that if i specify the due date they will mail the check enough in advance that the credit card company will get it by the due date but do you really trust the usps to deliver your check by noon or whatever besides the bank will put a hold on that money the day that check is cut i have n't bothered to check if the money being held still earns interest or not   in any case the bank all responsibility for the after effects late payment fees finance charges on all purchases etc if that paper check is not received on time and so your credit card account goes to late payment status   oh and my bank also wants a monthly fee for its billpay service any number   of such electronic checks allowed each month the billpay service does include payment electronically to local merchants and utilities that have accounts at the bank and have signed up to receive payments electronically all my credit card companies allow me to use their website to authorize them to collect the payment that i specify from my bank account(s i can choose the day the amount and which of my bank accounts they will collect the money from but i must do this every month very conveniently they show a calendar for choosing the date with the due date marked prominently and as mhoran_psprep 's comment points out the payment can be scheduled well in advance of the date that the payment will actually be made that is i do n't need to worry about being without internet access because of travel and thus being unable to login to the credit card website to make the payment on   the date it is due i can also sign up for autopay which takes amount minimum payment due payment in full whatever i choose   on the date due and this will happen month after month after month   with no further action necessary on my part   with either choice   it is up to the card company to collect money from my account on the day specified and if they mess up they can not charge late payment fees or finance charge on new purchases etc   also unlike   my bank there are no fees for this service it is also worth noting that many people do not like the idea of the credit card company withdrawing money from their bank account and so this option is not to everyone 's taste

going private does not mean that the company buys its own shares only that the freely traded shares are bought up by a private entity this can be management = gt management buy out or it can be a private investor the stock is then not traded publicly and the company gets rid of a whole slew of compliance obligations    in your stated example the company would essentially convert all its stock to treasury stock which does not pay dividends and has no voting rights from what i gather from some googling this would actually imply that the company would liquidate itself since it now has no capital anymore not sure on this though an accountant might be able to help here

the specific state pension plan you have linked to is provided by the government of the u.k. to workers resident there more generally speaking many countries provide some kind of basic worker 's pension or social security to residents   in the united states it is called surprise social security and in canada most of us call ours canada pension plan   such pensions are typically funded by payroll deductions distinct separate from income tax deducted at source   you can learn about the variety of social security programs around the world courtesy of the u.s. social security administration 's own survey what those and many other government or state pensions have in common and the term or concept that i think you are looking for is that they are typically defined benefit type of plans   a defined benefit or db plan is where there is a promised or defined benefit i.e. a set lump sum amount such as with a cash balance type of db plan or income per year in retirement more typical note defined benefit plans are not restricted to be offered by governments only many companies also offer db plans to their employees but db plans in the private sector are becoming more rare due to the funding risk inherent in making such a long term promise to employees whereas a defined contribution or dc plan is one where employee and/or employer put money into a retirement account the balance of which is invested in a selection of funds then at retirement the resulting lump sum amount or annual income amounts if the resulting balance is are based on the performance of the investments selected that is with a dc plan there is no promise of you getting either a set lump sum amount or a set amount of annual income at retirement   the promise was up front on how much money they would contribute   so the contributions are defined often according to a matching contribution scheme yet the resulting benefit itself is not defined i.e. promised summary db plans promise you the money the benefit you 'll get at retirement dc plans only promise you the money the contributions you get now

to expand on the comment made by you 're looking to take a short position   a short position essentially functions as follows   here 's the rub you have unlimited loss potential   maybe you borrow a share and sell it at $ 10   maybe in a month you still have n't closed the position and now the share is trading at $ 1,000   the share lender comes calling for their share and you have to close the position at $ 1,000 for a loss of $ 990   now what if it was $ 1,000,000 per share etc to avoid this unlimited loss risk you can instead buy a put option contract   in this situation you buy a contract that will expire at some point in the future for the right to sell a share of stock for $ x.   you get to put that share on to someone else if the underlying stock price were to instead rise above the put 's exercise price the put will expire worthless but your loss is limited to the premium paid to acquire the put option contract there are all sorts of advanced options trades sometimes including taking a short or long position in a security   it 's generally not advisable to undertake these sorts of trades until you 're very comfortable with the mechanics of the contracts   it 's definitely not advisable to take an unhedged short position either by borrowing someone else 's to sell or selling an option when you sell the option you take the risk because of the unlimited loss potential described above

having worked for a financial company for years my advice is to stay away from all the freedom funds offered   they 're a new way for fidelity to justify charging a higher management fee on those particular funds   that extra 1 or so a year is great for making the company money it will kill your rate of return over the next 25 + years you 're putting money into your retirement account   all these funds do is change the percentage of your funds in stocks vs. more fixed investments bonds etc so you have a higher percentage in stocks while you 're young and slowly move the percentage more towards fixed as you get older   if you take a few hours every 5 years to re balance your portfolio and just slowly shift more money towards fixed investments you 'll achieve the same thing without the extra annual fee so how much difference are we talking here   let 's do a quick example   based on your salary of $ 70k and a 4 match by your company you 'll have $ a year to put in your 401(k your 4 plus matched 4   i 'll also assume an 8 annual return for both funds   here is what that 1 extra service charge will cost you fund with a 1 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ 60.00 annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ fund with a 2 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ that 's a total of $ in extra fees over 25 years on just the investment you make this year   next year if you invest the same amount in your 401k that will be another $ paid over 25 years to the management company   this pattern repeats each year you pay the higher management fee   trust me if you invest that money in stock instead of paying it as fees you 'll have a whole lot more money saved when it 's time to retire my advice pick a percentage you 're comfortable with in stocks at your age maybe 85 90 and pick the stock funds with the lowest management fees the remaining 10 15 should go into a fixed fund   make sure you pick at least some of your stock money i do 20 25 and select a diverse lots of different countries international fund for any retirement money you plan to save above the 4 getting matched by your company set up a roth ira   that will give you the freedom to invest in any stocks or funds you want   find some low cost index funds such as vti for stocks and for bonds and put your money in those   invest the same amount every month automatically and your cost average will work itself out through up markets and down good luck

looking at your numbers i would definitively consider selling the car and use the public transportation instead you could easily save $ 450 month plus gas and maintenance as you mentioned public transportation will be only a fraction of this amount so you might end up saving around $ 400 monthly if you decide to keep the car the amount that you will spent monthly is easily a payment for a brand new car what if god forbid for any kind of reason you get a traffic ticket that can increase your insurance premium what if the engine stops working and you will need to spent thousands of dollars fixing the car with this and all of the other expenses up you might be unable to afford all this at some point if you decide to sell the car the money that you will save monthly can be put in a savings account or in any other sort of safe investment instrument in this way if your situation changes where you need a car again you will be able to easily afford a new car regarding your need to visit your friends on the suburbs every other weekend i think you can just talk with them and meet on places where public transportation is available or ask them to pick you up in the nearest station to the suburbs   in conclusion based on what you said i do not think the little convenience that you get in owning the car outweighs the big savings that you get monthly if you decide to sell the car

i think the $ 500 mm number was bullshit a common trick is that a private company will raise $ 50 mm for 10 of the company and say they 're worth $ 500 mm but then it turns out that the new investors get like they 're guaranteed to be paid back first if the company goes bankrupt or they 're guaranteed to get back the first $ 100 mm of an ipo since the company really sold 10 of itself plus other stuff they are worth less than $ 500 mm    therefore i find 's claim that reddit was worth $ 250 mm in 2015 credible it is also why i 'm suspicious about the $ number today

stock has value to the buyer even if it does not currently pay dividends since it is part ownership of the company and the company 's assets the owners of which you are now a part hire managers to make a dividend policy decision   if the company can reinvest the profits into a project that would earn more than the minimum acceptable rate of return then they should do so if the company has no internal investment opportunities at or above this desired rate then the company has an obligation to declare a dividend   paying out a dividend returns this portion of profit to the owners who can then invest their money elsewhere and earn more for example the stock market currently has say a 5 rate of return company a has a $ 1 m profit and can invest it in a project with an expected 10 rate of return so they should do so company b has a $ 1 m profit but their best internal project only has an expected 2 rate of return   it is in the owners best interest to receive their portion of their company 's profit as a dividend and re invest it in other stocks others have pointed out the tax portion of dividend policy so i skipped that

it 's harder than you think   once card companies start seeing your debt to credit line ratios climb they will slash your credit lines quickly also cash credit lines are always much smaller so in reality such a scheme would require you to buy goods that can be converted to cash which dilutes your gains and makes it more likely that you 're going to get detected and busted think of the other problems where do you store your ill gotten gains how do you get the money out of the country how will your actions affect your family and friends also most people are basically good people the prospect of defrauding $ 100k leaving family and friends behind and living some anonymous life in a third world country is n't an appealing one if you are criminally inclined building up a great credit history is not very practical most criminals are by nature reactive and want quick results

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

there is more than one exchange where stock can be traded    for example there is the new york stock exchange and the london stock exchange   in fact if you look at all the exchanges there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments eg us government bonds the closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the nyse   however options close after that and so there is after the close trading in many stocks with active options so the price at the close of options trading at cboe is often used the real price is always changing   but for the purpose of discussion using the closing price in nyse for nyse listed stocks is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned   likewise using bloomberg 's price makes sense using some after hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers until tomorrow

an investment in knowledge always pays the best interest as ben franklin said however this is not a question i can answer for you as it depends on the opportunities that are specifically available to you as an individual sometimes opportunities will knock on your door and you can take advantage other times you have to create that door to allow opportunities to knock maybe you have a friend that is opening a side business maybe there is a class you can get into at a trivial cost what i suggest is to start investing just to get into the habit of it not so much for the returns before you do however any financial advisor will advise you to begin with a emergency fund worth about 3 6 months of your expenses for that time i wanted to hit the ground running and start investing in stocks but first things first i guess millionaire next door will help you get into a saving mindset i will teach you to be rich is ok plenty of other books my advice is keep doing what you 're doing learn to start saving and once you have obtained an emergency fund of the amount of your choosing start looking to invest in index funds or etfs through any platform that has low fees i use betterment but vanguard is good too as they allow you to get your feet wet and it 's passive hope this helps

i think you take some pretty big liberties assuming i think people deserve failure if you assume i think that please note that this speaks more to how you view people who are not wealthy than i do   that aside i think you 're using lucky in a way that most people do not in this instance   is it lucky to eventually achieve a reasonable goal with decades of consistency sure in the ways that i mentioned nuclear war did n't break out no fatal traffic accidents happened etc   do you think that is what people usually mean when they say people who have more money are just lucky or do you think they use the term lucky to mean there is no merit basis for the difference   side note i 'm not saying everyone with money has it because of merit any more than i am saying everyone without money deserves to be broke if anything i 'm disagreeing with the semantics used to discuss wealth and income disparity partly because it is divisive

my ups guy said that amazon and ups are basically merged at this point   their major hubs work in the same buildings   sometimes amazon does n't even touch a product it goes right into the ups system   so all amazon really needs to do is push inventory down to the existing local ups centers which really only requires some more warehouse space at an existing site   with some intelligent data mining could figure out which products to offer with same day shipping which with 1-day etc

during market hours there are a lot of dealers offering to buy and sell all exchange traded stocks dealers do n't actually care about the company 's fundamentals and they set their prices purely based on order flow if more people start to buy than sell the dealer notices his inventory going down and starts upping the price both his bid and ask there are also traders who may not be dealers but are willing to sell if the price goes high enough or buy if the price goes low enough this keeps the prices along smoothly during normal trading hours if you buy something and turn around and sell it two minutes later you 'll probably be losing a couple cents per share outside normal market hours the dealers who continue to have a bid and ask listed know that they do n't have access to good price information   there is n't a liquid market of continuous buying and selling for the dealer to set prices he considers safe so what does he do he widens the spread he does n't know what the market will open tomorrow at and does n't know if he 'll be able to react quickly to news so instead of bidding $ and offering at $ he 'll move that out to $ 33 and $ 36 the dealer still makes money sometimes off this because maybe some trader realized that he has options expiring tomorrow or a short position that he 's going to get a margin call on or some kind of event that pretty much forces him to trade or maybe he 's just panicking and to some news so why not trade after hours because there 's no liquidity and trading when there 's no liquidity costs you a lot

assuming that partial payments are held without interest until enough money has accumulated to make at least a full payment and assuming that overpayments are applied toward principal a strategy of making three $   payments per month will shorten your amortization period by less than one month   these calculations assume that the interest rate is 12.5 percent apr compounded monthly with an apy of percent instead of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   you would make the equivalent of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   if you make one $   payment every ten days you will make an average of partial payments per year instead of 36 partial payments per year   this will speed up your loan amortization by about another month and a half over the course of the 72 month loan   one month of shortening is due to the extra principal payments and the other half month is due to interest savings    to a second approximation this strategy is similar to paying $   per month for 69 months plus a final payment of $     in other words this strategy will probably involve about payments of $   each possibly with a small payment

what are you talking about the rules are regulations are setup as needed if you give a concrete e.g. maybe if you give a concrete example of where the govt is in the way i can understand rules and regulations are not examples of govt in the way in itself it would be if say you need to do something but you need to petition the govt first for something and there 's tons of bureaucracy or or something else govt just set the rules such as stop at red light etc   govt is not in the way here    the rest of your comments are on same line so this one bullet is enough again you 're just accusing generally with no specifics and i 'm not naive this is real and my opinion govt sets new rules as needed as a response to something not because people in the govt who change every few years feel so you 're talking about changing people in govt all adhering to the same laws because it makes sense to keep it and if not it gets repealed govt is not one same set of people always present from your birth to death govt keeps changing govt does care about fairness and hft 's existing is proof that govt lets free market and private business start things as it pleases till such time as it stops being fair for all    govt is not really an inhibitor to free market govt actually has no to free market because it allows a fair and balanced free market unlike what you 're referring to which is a free market with no rules like the wild wild west we had that free market before and over time people went from unregulated markets to more regulated markets because it is for our own good govt is just people who agreed with it joined the govt and made it so and others agreed if we do n't agree in future it can be changed    there is a term as regulated free market unregulated free market will lead to salesmen and generally a backwards movement to the wild west again   i do n't think you really want to talk you just want to spew your ignorant libertarian viewpoints because you 've heard them somewhere without thinking much about it you just blindly believe the govt is always wrong with no logic or justification just like religious people    just think on a few points and you will see that you are wrong sometimes is the govt perfect heck no is it always right nope but it is some times and it does do the right things many times it does the wrong things at times as well    but i do n't believe like you do at all because i think for myself and reason if you reason on a few points you 'll see the other viewpoint and stop reading or ron paul because they 're not right about govt being always wrong either    i wo n't bother replying to you anymore because you 're just a troll or arrogant smug guy who thinks he knows it all because your friends all think like you and blindly agree with you so you 've never been taken to reason or logic like others have to you on this board look at the other replies to your posts almost all contradict you just think why are they all wrong or perhaps you are

basically any time someone claims they put money into your bank account or send you a check or something similar and then asks you to send money to someone else it is a scam what you need to do 1 under no circumstances whatsoever must you ever send money to anyone 2 talk to your bank and ask them for advice   the money that gets put into your bank account is n't real it has been paid with a forged check or a stolen credit card number or a hacked or faked bank account your bank will figure this out eventually and then they will take that money away it may take many weeks but the money will disappear   meanwhile any money that you send to someone is real it 's your money when you send it it is gone your bank will hold you to that   so in your case if they say they pay you $ 6,000 for a job but put $ 10,000 into your bank account and ask you to pass $ 4,000 on to someone the $ 4,000 you pay comes out of your bank account a long time later the $ 10,000 comes out of your bank account and you owe the bank $ 4,000 plus sometimes the job involves real work that obviously does n't pay   an alternative is that this is money laundering in which case you would become a criminal by being involved

you should speak to a good tax adviser the less documentation you have the more problems irs are going to cause you generally you can deduct business losses in the year they occurred which is 2011 but you have to show that that was a valid business not just a way to reduce your tax bill with personal expenses thus lack of documentation reduces your ability to prove that you 're entitled to the deduction the burden of proof is generally on you you can not deduct it from 2012 taxes but you can still amend 2011 keep in mind though that amended returns have higher chance of audit and a significant business loss on a business that only existed that year is a major red flag which will raise the probability of an audit to very high percentage theoretically if the business was real and just failed you can definitely deduct this but practically lack of documentation may cause too big a problem and a tax adviser might suggest you giving it up if he does n't think you have a real chance to convince the irs definitely do n't do that without a professional advice it is worth fighting for its quite a loss but do n't do it on your own as you will definitely lose

your capital gain is about $ 40 k which assuming your total income is under $ 250 k is taxed at 15 long term capital gains rate additional depreciation recapture of approximately $ 5 k is taxed at 25 so this gives us rough estimate of $ tax this is federal tax az rates are somewhere between 2 and 4 so you 'll be looking at some $ 1.6 k additional tax to az if you have accumulated rental losses or other expenses it will lower the total amount of your gain and accordingly the taxes this is all very rough estimates and you should n't rely on this but verify on your own or with a professional i suggest using professional services because while being costly they will probably save you more in taxes than you 'll have to pay them because of the knowledge of what exactly of your expenses can be deducted and how to calculate the cost basis correctly edit from the home exclusion requires occupancy for 2 of prior 5 years for the op the prorated $ 125k exclusion might cover the gain it depends when the increase in value occurred if the gain was during the time rented it 's taxable i believe

suppose you have a bar of gold and are hungry i buy the gold from you for cash which you then use to buy food clothes and generally support yourself   would it be fair to say that i paid for your food clothes etc i do n't think so i think you paid for them in gold i facilitated the exchange of gold into money and without me or someone like me around to provide liquidity for your gold you 'd still be hungry but fundamentally it was the gold that was valuable   now suppose there is a lack of liquidity in gold there 's a shortage of gold buyers i take advantage of this distortion to offer to buy your gold for half its free market value you do n't want to accept this deal but since your only alternative is starvation you accept   i say this is wrong not because of socialism but because of capitalism the efficiency of capitalism arises from the price system of value goods and services command a fair market price and buyers and sellers have access to both liquidity and good information about the relative value of things when distortions are allowed to interfere with free market pricing as inevitably happens under faire capitalism this efficiency is lost good government regulation is necessary to keep markets free and efficient and this is good for everyone   so what does this have to do with david siegel   first nothing in my example above changes when you substitute labor for gold if i am hungry but i have a skill and i sell you some of my labor for cash then use the cash to buy food you did not give me the you did not pay for my food you did not make it possible for me to get food or anything of the sort i paid for it myself by trading labor for cash in exactly the same way that you could trade gold for cash   second the price system of value allows you to earn a normal profit which means sufficient profit for resources to remain within an industry but excess profit harms market efficiency and thus the price system this is pure capitalist theory straight from adam smith it is nothing to do with socialism or communism it is quite clear that david siegel is taking excess profit this is no different from the sort of profiteering i described when there 's only one gold dealer in town it is parasitic behavior according to capitalist theory   and finally david siegel is the guy who invented high pressure selling of by inviting to a free vacation trapping them in a room and basically holding them hostage until they sign on the dotted line his business is near criminal you can argue that drug also create thousands of jobs that does n't make them good people or their actions beneficial to society i already thought david siegel was a parasite on society before i ever heard of his opinion on obama and quite frankly i 'm shocked and appalled that people are actually defending him

high frequency trades are intra day the would buy a stock for 100 and sell for multiple times so if you start with 100 in your broker account you buy something it takes 2 3 days to settle you sell for it takes 2 3 days to settle you again buy something for 100 it is the net value of both buys and sells that you need to look at trading on margin accounts most brokers offer margin accounts the exact leverage ratios varies what this means is that if you start with 10 or 15 or 25 in your broker you can buy stock of 100 of course legally you wo nt own the stock unless you pay the broker balance etc

you 'll have to research the canada side of things on your own or maybe someone else can answer that side for the germany side there is a gift tax which depends on the relationship of the giver and receiver has an overview here which shows the tax class and tax free amount so according to the overview nieces get 20 000 € tax free amount anything over 20 000 € within 10 years from the same gift giver will be taxed with tax class 2 which can range from 15 to 43 depending on the gifted amount the full article is here it also a few tricks for example if you want to gift 40 000 € to your niece you could gift 20 000 € directly and 20 000 € to your brother or sister who then gifts it to their daughter you 'll have to trust them to do that though because you ca n't put that in a contract bottom line of this if you want to gift more than 20 000 € your niece should contact a tax advisor   about the bank transfer your niece will have to declare any bank transfers over 12 500 € that she receives her bank will know how to do that so she should just ask them it also might be helpful for her to have a letter from you stating that the money came from you and is a gift just in case the tax office does n't believe that the money is n't from

points are significant levels technical analysts can use to determine directional movement support and resistance pivot points use the prior period 's high low and close to formulate future support and resistance in this regard pivot points are predictive or leading indicators there are at least five different versions of pivot points i will focus on standard pivot points here as they are the simplest if you are looking to trade off daily charts you would work out your pivot points from the prior month 's data for example pivot points for first trading day of february would be based on the high low and close for january they remain the same for the entire month of february new pivot points would then be calculated on the first trading day of march using the high low and close for february to work out the standard pivot points you use the high low and close from the previous period i.e. for daily charts it would be from the previous month in the following formulas you will now have 5 horizontal lines p r2 s1 and s2 which will set the general tone for price action over the next month a move above the pivot point p suggests strength with a target to the first resistance a break above first resistance shows even more strength with a target to the second resistance level r2 the converse is true on the downside a move below the pivot point p suggests weakness with a target to the first support level s1 a break below the first support level shows even more weakness with a target to the second support level s2 the second resistance and support levels r2 s2 can also be used to identify potentially overbought and oversold situations a move above the second resistance level r2 would show strength but it would also indicate an overbought situation that could give way to a similarly a move below the second support level s2 would show weakness but would also suggest a short term oversold condition that could give way to a bounce this could be used together with a momentum indicator such as rsi or stochastic to confirm overbought or oversold conditions   pivot points offer a methodology to determine price direction and then set support and resistance levels however it is important to confirm pivot point signals with other technical analysis indicators such as candle stick reversal patterns stochastic and general support and resistance levels in the price action these pivot points can be handy but i actually have n’t used them for trade setups and entries myself i prefer to use candle sticks together with stochastic to determine potential turning points and then take out trades based on these you can then use the pivot points resistance and support levels to help you estimate profit targets or areas to start becoming cautious and start tightening your stops say for example you have gone long from a signal you got a few days ago you are now in profit and the price is now approaching r2 whilst the stochastic is approaching overbought you might want to start tightening your stop loss as you might expect some weakness in the price in the near future if prices continue up you keep increasing your profits if prices do reverse then you keep the majority of your existing profits this would become part of your trade management if you are after finding potential market turning points and take out trades based on these then i would suggest using candlestick charting reversal patterns for your trade setups the patterns i like to use most in my trading can be described as either the hammer or one white soldier for bullish reversals and shooting star or one black for bearish reversals below are diagrams of where to place your entries and exits on both bullish and bearish reversal patterns bullish reversal pattern    so after some period of weakness in the price you would look for a bullish day where the price closes above the previous day ’s high you place your buy order here just before market close and place your initial stop just below the low of the day you would apply this either for an uptrending stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the support line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the oversold and crossing back upwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the down days and the market as a whole is moving up as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bullish move up at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves up you would move your stop loss to just below the low of each day alternative bullish reversal entry   an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop buy order to buy at the open of next trading day just above the high of the bullish green candle your stop is placed exactly the same just below the low of the green bullish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bullish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap up at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps up then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage bearish reversal pattern    so after some short period of strength in the price you would look for a bearish day where the price closes below the previous day ’s low you place your sell short order here just before market close and place your initial stop just above the high of the day you would apply this either for an stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the resistance line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the overbought and crossing back downwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the up days and the market as a whole is moving down as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bearish move down at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves down you would move your stop loss to just above the high of each day alternative bearish reversal entry    an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop sell short order to sell at the open of next trading day just below the low of the bearish red candle your stop is placed exactly the same just above the high of the red bearish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bearish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap down at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps down then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage you could also trade other candle stick patterns is similar ways and with the long entries you can also use them to get into the market with longer term trend following strategies you would usually just use a larger stop for longer term trading to determine the size of your order you would use the price difference between your entry and your stop you should not be risking more than 1 of your trading capital on any one trade so if your trading capital is $ 20,000 your risk per trade should be $ 200 if you were looking to place your buy at 5.00 and had your initial stop at $ you would divide $ 200 by $ 0.40 to get 500 stocks to buy using this form of money management you keep your losses down to a maximum of $ 200 some trades may be a bit higher due to some slippage which you should allow for in your trading plan which becomes your r multiple your aim is to have your average win at or higher 3 x your average loss which will give you a positive expectancy even with a win ratio under 50 once you have written down your trading rules you can search stock charts for potential setups when you find one you can backtest the chart for similar setup over the past few years for each setup in the past down the prices you would have entered at where you would have set your stop work out your r and go day by day moving your stop as you go and see where you would have been stopped out work out your profit or loss in terms of r for each setup and then add them up if you get a positive r multiple then this may be a good stock to trade on this setup if you get a negative r multiple then maybe give this stock a miss and look for the next setup you can setup watch lists of stocks that perform well for both long setups and short setups and then trade these stocks when you get a new signal it can take some time starting off but once you have got your watch lists for a particular setup you just need to keep monitoring those stocks you can create other watch lists for other type of setups you have backtested as well

you are probably going to hate my answer but if there was an easy way to id stocks like fb that were going to do what fb did then those stocks would n't exist and do that because they would be priced higher at the ipo the fact is there is always some doubt no one knows the future and sometimes value only becomes clear with time everyone wants to buy a stock before it rises right it will only be worth a rise if it makes more profit though and once it is established as making more profit the price will be already up because why would n't it be that means to buy a real winner you have to buy before it is completely obvious to everyone that it is going to make more profit in the future and that means stock prices trade at speculative prices based on expected future performance not current or past performance now i 'm not saying past and future performance has nothing in common but there is a reason that a thousand financially oriented websites quote a disclaimer like past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance now maybe this is sort of obvious but looking at your image excluding things like market capital that you 've not restricted the pe ratio is based on current price and past earnings the dividend yield is based on past publications of what the dividend will be and current price the price to book is based on past publication of the company balance sheet and current price the eps is based on past earnings and the published number of shares and the roi and net profit margin in based on published past profits and earnings and costs and number of shares so it must be understood that every criteria chosen is past data that analysts have been looking at for a lot longer than you have with a lot more additional information and experience with it the only information that is even current is the price thus my ultimate conclusive point is you ca n't based your stock picks on criteria like this because it 's based on past information and current stock price and the current stock price is based on the markets opinion of relative future performance the only way to make a good stock pick is understand the business understand its market and possibly understand world economics as it pertains to that market and business you can use various criteria as an initial filter to find companies and investigate them but which criteria you use is entirely your preference you might invest only in profitable companies ones that make money and probably pay regular dividends thus excluding something like an oil exploration company which will just lose money and lose it and lose some more forever unless it hits the jackpot in which case you might suddenly find yourself sitting on a huge profit it 's a question of risk and preference regarding your concern for false data google defines the return on investment ttm as trailing twelve month income after taxes divided by the average total long term debt + long term liabilities + shareholders equity expressed as a percentage if you really think they have it wrong you could contact them but it 's probably correct for whatever past data or last annual financial results it 's based on

i 'd like to make two points to focus on your test case of japan   you point out that about a third of them believe they 'll work until they die   that means more than a majority of them believe they 'll retire   in a democracy where a majority of people make decisions it is completely expected that the majority will dictate the policy   of course there is around that last statement because people who believe they 'll retire could very well be of the mindset that they 'll handle their retirement savings themselves rather than rely on government   similarly some people that expect to work until they die might realize that there 's a risk that they wo n't be able to to focus on the case of government run pensions   the pension program that a government runs is n't like a private savings plan where its purpose is to get you a good rate of return   at best it 's an insurance policy more accurately it 's just a tax and you should think of it this way   the reason you should think of it that way is several fold   one if the pension fund is ever short the government will make up the difference from the general fund   two the government can spend the money from the pension fund on other programs if the law changes which over the course of a lifetime is entirely possible   three no one has a legal right to withdraw their contributions directly   four the point of the program is to take care of old people so they are n't starving in the street   to do this they take the money of the young and give it to to old people   the money you pay in does n't go to investments of any sort it goes directly to the elderly   ultimately this is why you ca n't opt out and why you should think of those contributions as a tax and not as savings

the united states taxes gifts to the giver not the receiver   thus in your case there would be no direct tax implications from the receiver so long as you are gifting cash and the cash is in canada   if you are gifting capital stocks property etc or if you are gifting something that is in the united states us stock for example there may be a tax implication for either or both of you your adult child would however have to file an irs form since the gift is so large over $ 100k to create a paper trail for the money basically proving s he is n't money laundering or otherwise avoiding tax see this article in the globe and mail which goes into more detail there are no implications except that there is a form irs form 3520 that would have to be filed by the u.s. recipient if the foreign gift is over $ 100,000 u.s. but the child would still receive the gift tax free the u.s. gift tax would only apply when the canadian parent makes a gift of u.s. assets which are typically only u.s. real estate or tangible personal property such as a boat located in the u.s. for gift tax purposes u.s. shares are not considered to be u.s. assets

gt do you know why it 's so popular i thought other trucks are pretty good too    well for starters because ford the company is considered a more solid brand firm the two chief competitors chevy amp chrysler dodge are considered by some many actually to have themselves in the financial crash of 2008 2009     i know many previously loyal gm fans who swore after it became government motors that they would never buy another gm and the vast majority of them switched over to ford   and chrysler having gone through various owners is likewise looked at somewhat by many   you have to keep in mind that business owners are generally not just thinking of a singular vehicle purchase but of a series of such purchases often over years and decades as well as the supply of parts the availability amp consistency of service amp support whether internal in company shops or at dealers and so on anything amp everything that brings those things into the question mark territory tends to reduce confidence and thus shift the focus onto other brands that seem to be more stable   gt;you're right that they get burned out quickly although i 'd think there 'd be a longevity version of trucks by now    that would be part of the reputation of the f series and especially the f150 it is widely considered to be one of the best longest lasting least problematic vehicles made   toyota trucks very long living   yes and yet no   the history reputation has been a bit more spotty than with ford   the same is true of dodge and the other brands   certainly there will be people who think believe state otherwise i myself own a dodge that i am generally very happy with and i know others who have chevy and other brands and are likewise quite happy with them but over the years ford has built up a solid reputation with it 's truck line

the expression in debt when talking about a person 's financial affairs means that the sum of debit balances on all accounts exceeds the sum of credit balances on all accounts     a mortgage account is not excluded from that this definition also does not consider whether any of the debt is secured or ownership of assets shares property etc    so someone with a mortgage of one million dollars for a home that is worth two million is in debt by one million dollars until they they sell the home for that amount and pay down the mortgage that means in debt is not necessarily a statement about net worth

your scenario 2 in the money options not at the money the former is when the share price is higher than the option strike the second is when share price is right at strike i agree this is a highly unlikely scenario because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date that could make a big difference in which option they would buy i agree with the others that if you 're seeing this as real world then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you do n't i would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move    the other big factor that makes your question harder to answer more concisely is that you did n't tell us what the expiration dates on the options are this makes a difference in how you evaluate them we could probably be much more helpful to you if you could give us that information

i found the following on a stock to mutual conversion for insurance firms for ohio pulling from that link   any domestic stock life insurance corporation incorporated under a general law may become a mutual life insurance corporation and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock provided such plan a has been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such corporation b has been approved by a vote of stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock then outstanding at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose c has been approved by a majority of the policyholders voting at a meeting of policyholders called for the purpose each of whom is insured in a sum of at least one thousand dollars and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least one year prior to such meeting   and any stockholder who has to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the stockholders and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled may be ordered to do so by a decree of the court of common for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose and such decree may provide that upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation   since they successfully became a mutual insurance company i would guess that those stocks were acquired back by the company and are leftover from the conversion they would not represent an ownership in the company but might have value to a collector

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

i 'll tackle number 2 it 's one which many academics dismissed as an impossibility after all how could that be rational what could cause negative yields ie effectively giving an entity cash and paying for the privilege of doing so is something we 've experiencing currently fear back in the financial crisis investors were actually paying to store their cash in treasuries because of the   fear that if they left it with a bank they might not get it back    what about the fdic insurance you may ask quite logically the problem is that we 're talking about massive entities like pension funds asset managers corporations who normally would store some think millions billions in cash and cash equivalents bank accounts money market funds short term paper they really are n't protected so they do what turns out to be the rational thing which is pay a premium on safe assets ie us gov't bills to guarantee you get most of your money back   the same thing is currently happening with german front end paper as europeans pull their money out of banks periphery assets and search for safety   hope that helped

edit 2 my whole answer was based on my misunderstanding that you were renting out a totally separate property to your girl friend   i finally understand now that you 're renting out a room in your apartment flat to your gf   so based on my new understanding i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad idea   the answer below is my answer to a different question original answer my answer has nothing to do with business but is totally relationship based    if you care about her in a we might be together a long time way then i would n't do this   i do n't care what arrangements you setup before hand at some point you 're bound to feel like she owes you something at some point   let alone the easiest of situations to imagine she 's late on the rent she loses her job and ca n't pay etc you 'll be forced to make decisions about how much your desire to love and care for her outweighs your need to pay your mortgage   you can argue how your are all day long but is this something you want to bring into your relationship now if you do n't really care to stay with her that long and you could do life with or without her then go for it   i think the big question is is your relationship worth £ 200 edit in the interest of supporting my opinion here are a few articles i found on the subject unfortunately the way renting to friends or family often works out is far from what would be expected between people who care about one another for the most part friends and family members will actually make bad renters because they ’ll expect more from you than a tenant who does n’t know you you may get a lot of requests for maintenance and repairs even for minor things and you may also find that family members and friends think they should be entitled to perks because of your personal relationship with them when they do n’t get special treatment they can get angry with you and that hurts both your professional relationship and your personal relationship american apartment owners association in my experience landlords renting to relatives does n't work out perfectly said a realtor ® associate at williams realty in ca when you do n't know each other there are fewer problems

realistically fair is whatever you all mutually agree upon some people can do means based splits some people ca n't my recommendation is to split things evenly based on actual used space or usage do you have a with similarly sized rooms break it up by room so in this case your gf and you pay 50 and the other person pays 50 maybe there 's a garage or one br is bigger i 've seen splits not 50 50 based on these factors you may consider paying a third all around for rent but i would try to avoid solutions that are not usage based if you do n't and try for a means based split best case scenario is nothing really is different but the worst case scenario is setting yourself up to be taken advantage of because you are effectively subsidizing other people this often changes relationships not always but often frankly the best option here is to find a place that is more affordable for everyone trying to make it so that your gf and roommate are not going to be in a difficult financial place by living with you it resolves all the problems here

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

for case 1 there is no tax due as you sold the book for less than your cost basis if you had sold for more than $ 100 then you would have had a profit for case 2 that depends on the value of the gift card with respect to the value of your fare most likely that gift card is less than the cost of the fare and in that case it would generally be treated as a reduction in the purchase price the same way that rebates and cash back on credit card are treated note if for some reason a 1099 was generated that would change the situation and you would need to consult a tax professional since that would indicate that the other party to the transaction had a different view of the situation

when it comes to norway there is also a cultural aspect that translated into politics natural resources are seen as belonging to the people therefore natural resources are not sold to the higher bidder for instance the oil companies pay an extremely high extra tax in norway around 80 tax this means that most of the profit from the oil and gas goes back to the people and are put into a common wealth fund rather than going to a few share holders in oil companies over the years this has added up to a considerable amount of money this would not work in places like the us because it is seen as socialism not to let the oil companies and others rip off the population

when trading forex each currency is traded relative to another so when shorting a currency you must go long another currency vs the currency you are shorting it seems a little odd and can be a bit confusing but here is the explanation that wikipedia provides an example of this is as follows let us say a trader wants to trade    with the us dollar and the indian rupee currencies assume that the    current market rate is usd 1 to and the trader borrows    with this he buys usd 2 if the next day the conversion rate becomes    usd 1 to then the trader sells his usd 2 and gets he    returns and keeps the profit minus fees so in this example the trader is shorting the rupee vs the dollar does this article add up all other currency crosses to get the net figure so they do n't care what it is depreciating against this data is called the commitment of traders cot which is issued by the commodity futures trading commission cftc   in the wsj article it is actually referring to forex futures in an another article from it explains a bit clearer as to how a news organization comes up with these type of numbers according to the cftc cot data and calculations by reuters which calculates the dollar positions against the euro british pound japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar and the swiss franc so this article is not talking about futures but it does tell us they got data from the cot and in addition reuters added additional calculations from adding up x currency positions no subscription needed speculators pile up largest net dollar long position since june 2010 cftc here is some additional reading on the topic if you 're interested cftc commitment of the traders data cot report forex what is it and how does it work futures vs. forex options forex wiki

the core idea behind this statement is that there is always money for what you prioritize if you try to use whatever is left over after your bills for savings you probably wo n't save very much if anything in practice you decide on a fixed amount of money you will save out of each paycheck and put that aside in an investment or savings account then pay your bills out of what is left   essentially it is a way to counteract the tendency of your lifestyle rising to exactly meet your income and leaving nothing for savings

you should never have to pay a fee to find out what has happened to a transaction in progress you might sometimes have to pay for duplicate copies of a statement or similar but not just to find out what is going on it sounds like you are being scammed your friend tells you they have transferred you money but they have not done anything in reality then they give you a customer care number to call and try to get you to pay them money in order to find out what has happened to the non existent transaction if you think this is plausibly what is happening for example if you google the company who is supposedly doing the transfer and find that they do not exist or that the number you have been given is not really their customer care line then you should cease all contact with your friend and pass all communications to your local law enforcement

as others have noted your definition of market price is a bit loose   really whatever price you get becomes the current market price   what you usually get quoted are the current best bid and ask with the last transaction price   for stocks that do n't trade much the last transaction price may not be representative of the current market value your question included regulation standards bureau and i do n't think the current answers are addressing that   in the us the securities and exchange commission sec provides some regulation regarding execution price   it goes by the designation regulation and very roughly it says that each transaction has to take the best available price at the time that it is executed   there are some but that 's the gist of it no regulation ensures that there will be a counterparty to any transaction that you want to make   it could happen for example that you have shares of some company that you 're never able to sell because no one wants them bitcoin is the same in this regard   there is a currently a market for bitcoin but there 's no regulation that ensures there will be a market for it tomorrow outside of the us i do n't know what regulation if any exists

others have commented on the various studies if as joetaxpayer says this one particular study he mentions does not really exist there are plenty of others and in that case did someone blatantly lie to prove a bogus point or did someone just get the name of the organization that did the study wrong like it was really somebody called they read it as because they 'd heard of dun bradstreet but not of whoever is of course if they got the organization wrong maybe they got important details of the study wrong whatever   but let me add one logical point that i think is if you always buy with cash there is no way that you can spend more than you have when you run out of cash you have no choice but to stop spending but when you buy with a credit card you can easily spend more than you have money in the bank to pay even if it is true that most credit card users are responsible there will always be some who are not and credit cards make it easy to get in trouble   i speak from experience i once learned that my wife had run up $ 20,000 in credit card debt without my knowledge when she divorced me i got stuck with the credit card debt to this day i have no idea what she spent the money on and i 've known several people over the years who have gone bankrupt with credit card debt even if you 're responsible it 's easy to lose track with credit cards if you use cash when you take out your wallet to buy something you can quickly see whether there 's a lot of money left or not so much with credit you can forget that you made the big purchase more likely you can fail to add up the modest purchases it 's easy to say oh that 's just $ 100 i can cover that but then there 's $ 100 here and $ 100 there and it can add up or depending on your income level maybe it 's $ 10 here and $ 10 there and it 's out of hand or maybe it 's $ 10,000 it 's easier today when you can go on line and check the balance on your credit card but even at that well just this past month when i got one bill i was surprised at how big it was i went through the items and they were all legitimate they just added up do n't cry for me i could afford it but i had failed to pay attention to what i was spending and i let things get a little out of hand i 'm a pretty responsible person and i do n't do that often i can easily imagine someone paying less attention and getting into serious trouble

if you use a room or other separately identifiable space within your apartment exclusively for your business then you might be able to recoup a fraction of your rent for that check the rules for home office at the irs and adopt a consistent and well documented approach i would pay your full rent out of your personal account and then do an expense report for the portion that 's legitimately business related but that 's not a unique approach other than that i agree with the answer by you can not reduce your tax by the full amount of your rent just by having the s corp pay and trying to do so is probably playing with fire   generally speaking do n't business and personal expenses like that

you can file a revised w-4 with your employer claiming more allowances than you do now more allowances means less federal tax and if applicable and likely with a separate form less state tax this does n't affect social security and medicare with holding though   that being said us taxes are on a pay as you go system if the irs determines that you 're claiming more allowances than you 're eligible for and not paying the proper taxes throughout the year they will hit you with an underpayment penalty fee which would likely negate the benefits of keeping that money in the first place this is why independent contractors and self employed people pay quarterly or estimated taxes depending on the employer they may require proof of the allowances for adjustment before they accept the revised w-4

in the netherlands specifically there are several reasons to pay extra off on your mortgage first house prices have dropped significantly in the last several years   they are rising slowly now but it 's region specific and you can still borrow more than 100 of the price of the house   under these conditions if you choose to sell your house and the outstanding mortgage amount is greater than the value of your house you are left with a gap to finance   i think the rules have changed recently around this allowing you to finance this gap with a new mortgage but this is not a good idea   the tax implications of this are likely to be complicated in the long run and your new house may not cover this gap for some time second the less you owe on your house the lower mortgage rates you can get   mortgages in the netherlands usually fall into categories based on percentage of the auction price at a foreclosure sale   if you pay more of your mortgage off you may qualify for a lower interest rate possibly making refinancing interesting   this is especially important if interest rates continue to drop but the value of your house does not increase or even decreases third if you choose to keep your house and rent it out the banks in the netherlands have very strict rules on this if you want to do it above board   i 've read that some banks require the mortgage amount nb not the value you may have built up in a linked savings or insurance account to be less than 50 of the foreclosure auction price   also related to point 2 if you have something other than a linear or annuity mortgage you will need to refinance to do this as the tax advantages around savings mortgages do not apply if it is not used as your own residence finally if you choose to sell and you are in the happy position of having the value of your house be greater than the value of your mortgage you have an there may still be some obstacles   any value you have accumulated in a linked savings or life insurance account is not available until after you sell your house   extra value derived purely from the difference between mortgage value and sale price may be easier to deal with edit as a final note i 've made extra payments on both a linked life insurance and a linked savings account   in one the principal paid each month reduced and the mortgage lifetime stayed the same   in the other the principal paid each month stayed the same and the lifetime reduced   in both cases interest payments were less each month   i would contact your mortgage provider to understand what the expected impact of extra payments will be

almost any financial institution has the technical ability to do this simply called sweeps auto sweeps or deposit sweeps the issue you face is finding an institution that is willing to do it for you   i think you will have the most luck at your primary financial institution where you currently keep the majority of your banking relationship   you will have better luck at small town banks and credit unions   the mega banks will likely not from their established policies deposit sweeps are common for business accounts   they are usually tied to a savings account which is usually held within the same institution however this is not a requirement   the sweep can send money to any us bank if you can provide the routing number and account number   the sweep will establish a peg balance or floor balance on the checking account   at the end of the day any amount above the peg is swept into the savings account automatically i doubt you will find what you ’re asking for within an online banking system   you will likely have to go into a branch and speak with a personal banker   explain to them you want to establish a sweep on your checking account and want to send the funds to another financial institution   you will have better luck asking for a peg of $ 100 or some other small amount   they may not take your request seriously if you want to completely empty the checking account to zero

others have already commented on the impact of anything which merchants from raising possible breaches so i wo n't dwell on that maybe we need stronger legislation maybe we do n't but it does n't change today 's answer often it works the other way around to what you might expect rather than the merchant noticing and notifying visa mc others visa mc others spot patterns of suspicious activity example 1 i do n't have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notified notifying between merchants and payment processors but at the point when your card is identified as compromised there 's no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised let alone identified in fact because there 's a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be it 's simply not safe to assume that simply brand x has been compromised therefore everything brand x knows about you is also compromised furthermore there 's no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to or discovered the root cause mc visa banks at the point at which they 're cancelling cards simply ca n't say at least not in a way that might backfire involving lots of lawyers because the standard of proof needed to go on record blaming someone is simply not yet met so yes it 's common that you are n't told anything for all of the above reasons and of course if you really want to find out more you may have some success with your local data protection legislation and formally make a subject access request or local equivalent to see what that brings back be sure to do it in writing to the official address of both mastercard and your bank

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

go to your local bank or credit union before talking to a dealership ask them if putting both names on the loan makes a difference regarding rates and maximum loan you qualify for ask them to run the loan application both ways having both names on the loan helps build the credit of the spouse that has a lower score     you may find that both incomes are needed for a car loan if the couple has a mortgage or other joint obligations the lender will treat the entire mortgage payment or rent payment as a liability against the person applying for the loan they wo n't split the housing payment in half if only one name will be on the car loan therefore sometimes the 2nd persons income is needed even if their credit is not as good that additional income without a significant increase in liabilities can make a huge difference regarding the loan they can qualify for once the car is in your possession it does n't matter who drives it in general the insurance company will put both spouses as authorized drivers note it is almost always better to ask your bank or credit union about a car loan before going to the dealership that gives you a solid data point regarding a loan and removes a major complexity to the negotiations at the dealership

almost all unions want the business they are in to survive most of the stories you hear are such an extreme outlier or just plain made up   believe it or not everyone in the union wants the corp to survive to pay them retirement benefits they do nt want to rape the corp like corps rape resources   they want fair pay they want pay to go up when the company does better just like companies tend to demand pay cuts or fire people when the company does worse   quit treating people like a commodity and instead treat them like actual people helping your actual corp to actually grow

the money that you have under your control e.g. in bank accounts savings accounts taxable investments etc is your money and there is no tax of any kind either in india or in us that needs to be paid when the money is transferred to india as dheer 's answer says you need to transfer all these monies within 7 years as per indian tax law for your 401(k account assuming that all the money is tax deferred i.e. you contributed to a regular 401(k and not a roth 401(k you will have separated from service as far as us tax law is concerned so check if it is at all possible to roll over the money into a similar scheme in india specifically the employees provident fund wikipedia says the schemes covers both indian and international workers for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed 14 such social security agreements are active and so a rollover might be possible if not you could withdraw small amounts each year and avoid us income tax but not the 10 excise tax but how long you can continue holding 401(k assets after return to india and whether that is long enough to drain the 401(k are things that you need to find out

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

is the remaining amount tax free as in if the amount shown which i can sell on etrade is $ 5000 then if i sell the entire shares will my bank account be increased by $ 5000 the stocks they sell are withholding   so let 's say you had $ 7000 of stock and they sold $ 2000 for taxes   that leaves you with $ 5000   but the actual taxes paid might be more or less than $ 2000   they go in the same bucket as the rest of your withholding   if too much is withheld you get a refund   too little and you owe them   way too little and you have to pay penalties    at the end of the year you will show $ 7000 as income and $ 2000 as withheld for taxes from that transaction   you may also have a capital gain if the stock increases in price   they do not generally withhold on stock sales as they do n't necessarily know what was your gain and what was your loss   you usually have to handle that yourself    the main point that i wanted to make is that the sale is not tax free   it 's just that you already had tax withheld   it may or may not be enough

toward the philosophical side of your question it seems to me that what is most important is knowing how well your fund is performing versus it 's benchmark this is an actionable piece of information that can help you get out of an under performing fund although if you 're already using vanguard it 's likely a low cost and broadly diversified fund ultimately what you want to avoid over the long term is under performing the market due to high fees market timing poor fund selection etc and selecting a fund that closely tracks the market seems to be the best way to achieve this assuming that you intend to be a passive investor i do n't see a clear benefit to calculating a personal rate of return if the fund is performing well versus its benchmark you are likely to stay with it and if it is performing poorly you   are likely to pull out at the end of the day the complicated accounting wo n't actually change the amount you 've got in your account so i 'd recommend picking a good fund checking up on it once in a great while and putting your time to better purpose

the money is not subject to tax because it was deposited you can deposit money as much as you like that 's not what is triggering the tax what is triggering the tax is the sale itself and it has already happened if your friend is taxed for capital gains under the spanish tax law then this money is already taxable and not paying the tax due is tax evasion depositing the money may indeed trigger an investigation that will lead to evasion charges but it would not be the depositing the money that was against the law not depositing the money does n't mean you will avoid investigation it just means that the authorities may learn about it in a different way and charge you with additional crimes while at it money laundering fraud whatever keeping large amounts of cash brings additional complications and dangers the more people knowing about it and they will as you spend it the higher chances are for you to split it with some robber or thief i suggest talking to a licensed tax accountant in spain about whether the sale of the flat is taxable in spain or not if it is pay the taxes due and be done with that

investopedia states while early exercise is generally not advisable because the time    value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so there are    certain circumstances under which early exercise may be advantageous    for example an investor may choose to exercise a call option that is    deeply in the money such an option will have negligible time value    just before the ex dividend date of the underlying stock this will    enable the investor to capture the dividend paid by the underlying    stock which should more than offset the marginal time value lost due    to early exercise so the question is how well do you see the time value factor here

perhaps an example will help make it more clear any given year   revenue   200 k profit 60 k you get 40 k in profit plus any salary he gets 20 k next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell   you would get 100 of the proceeds this is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company 's profits and reduce his pay   for the given example you could pay yourself a 60 k bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation   there should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation edit it is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly   honesty in business is necessary for long term success   i would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates   for example lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10   your profit would be 6 and with the suggested split he would receive $ 2 you $ 4 instead i would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated this allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales   it also allows him to share revenue with his staff    alternatively you could also do a split   perhaps 7.5 of revenue and 10 of profit

credit cards have three important advantages none of them are for day to day borrowing of money safety credit cards have better fraud protection than checks or cash and better than most debit check cards if you buy something with a credit card you also get the issuer 's think visa assurances that your will get the product you paid for or your money back at almost any time if a product you buy is not what you expect you can work with the issuer even if the store says screw you security credit cards are almost universally accepted as a security against damages to the vendor hotels car rentals boat rentals etc will accept a credit card as a means of securing their interests without that you may have to make huge deposits or not be able to rent at all for example in my area you can not rent a car on debit or cash you must use a credit card around here most hotel rooms require a credit card as well this is different from area to area but credit cards are nearly universally accepted emergencies if you 're using your credit card properly then you have some extra padding when stuff goes wrong for example it may be cheaper to place a bill on a credit card for a couple months while you recover from a car accident than to deplete your bank account and have to pay fees bonus some cards have perks like miles points or cash back some can be very beneficial you need to be careful about the rules with these bonuses for example some cards only give you points if you carry a balance some only give miles if you shop at certain stores but if you have a good one these can be pretty fantastic a 3 cash back on purchases can make a large difference over time

in addition to the excellent answers here i might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence   lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the s&p 500    if you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash   lets say 98 of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the s&p 500   you will will miss matching the s&p 500 because you have 2 not invested in some money market account    if you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track   i am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that i know these etfs are used for the difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called beta slippage there are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link

you can never depend only on pension you must get financial education and invest your money i recommend you to read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham it 's the bible of warren buffet besides you do n't need to be a billionaire for retiring and be happy i recommend you to get education in etfs i quote the intelligent investor by benjamin graham p. according to associates the leading financial research firm if you had invested $ 12,000 in the standard poor 's index at the beginning of september 1929 10 years later you would have had only $ left but if you had started with a paltry $ 100 and simply invested another $ 100 every single month then by august your money would have grown to $ that 's the power of disciplined buying even in the face of the great depression and the worst bear market of all time you are still young to make even investments but seriously you can never depend only on pension you wo n't regret learning how to invest your money it does n't matter if it 's in the stock market real state market whatever market knowing what to do with your money is priceless i hope this helps happy profits

i think i may have figured this out but if someone could double check my reasoning i 'd appreciate it so if my company makes $ and i decide to pay myself a $ 30000 salary then the quarterly payment break down would be like this 1040es would pay income tax on non salary dividend $ 941 would pay income tax ss medicare on salary $ 30000 i 'm the only person on payroll so i think this answers my question in that after switching from filing as llc to s corp i wo n't have to pay as much on 1040es because some of it will now be covered on payroll

the way i read that is that he 's arguing for further tax cuts for corporations   he is a huge shareholder and would be paid in options or shares    if a big corporate tax cut happens profits go up the share price goes up and thus an amount of money goes directly into his own pocket     you can read his motives by the statement driving capital earnings overseas   that is code for foreign countries like ireland winning because their corporate taxes are lower

a share is just a part ownership of a company if you buy a share of a green stock in the open market you now just own   part of a green company just like if you buy a house the money you paid moves to the former owner but what you are getting is a clear asset in return that you now own via mutual funds indexes this can get a little more complicated voting rights etc tend to go to the mutual indexing company rather than the holders of the fund but is approximately the same thing the fund buys assets on the open market then holds them buys more or sells them on behalf of the fund investors

here is one other consideration do n't do n't do n't sell based on insider information insider trading can land you in jail and it 's not restricted to top executives even a discussion about the current status of the acquisition talks can mean that you have insider information that you legally can not act on in many jurisdictions if you are just a regular employee the sec will likely not subject your dealings to special scrutiny especially since lots of your colleagues will likely trade your company 's shares at this point in time and if you definitely hold insider info for example if you are intimately involved with the acquisition talks you will likely have had a very serious warning about insider trading and know what you can and what you can not do nevertheless it 's better to be careful here

a few years back me and a couple of friends made about 100 of these on his 30 watt laser cutter at the time i was using them for ring boxes because i make spoon rings and wanted something to give to people for the nicer sterling rings if i remember correctly we used high plywood at 1/8 thickness the grade we were buying ran us about $ 30 for a sheet we cut them into sheets because that 's the max size for his laser and cut roughly 5 out of each sheet the ones we were making were of course much smaller than what you are looking at though materials alone ended up running about $ .50 a piece we were coating with one layer of oil it was roughly ten minutes to cut out 5 boxes then another ten minutes to pop them out of the plywood and assemble each one despite what has been stated with tweaking friction fit held up completely fine we did n't use glue on a single one and i still have a few laying around that are holding up fine also anyway say you are paying yourself roughly $ 20 an hour and you can speed it up from what we did and make 20 in an hour now you have $ 1 a piece in labor keep in mind if you go to a place to have these made from my experience most places will charge you roughly $ 1 a minute for laser time add engraving time if you want a logo or something on them probably another minute per box all in all in the end these are going to end up costing you $ a box if you have free access to a laser i would imagine anyone making them for you would probably charge double that    in the end after the first batch of both these boxes some slightly different and some jewelry trees we found out that it 's hard to sell these items for an affordable price and still make it worth your while if i remember correctly we ended up selling most of the remaining boxes for about $ 4 a piece just to break even and cover all of our expenses of course this is just my experience if someone has a way to do this more efficiently and for a profit i would be interested to hear it because we still have the laser and probably 100 sheets of plywood left

the following is based on my experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the uk over many years   and for further information i currently hold a credit score of 999 the highest possible with 6 credit cards   now i 'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative   however having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score   as you keep your accounts mostly settled i think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you   but see the next point    having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit counts in your favour   this means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use is net net in your favour   it also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances as in point 2 to be a lower percentage of your total available credit and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders    it appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued and are managing responsibly e.g. either paid off or used responsibly the better needless to say any late payments count against you   the best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month   lenders really like consistent payers new credit accounts initially will count against you for a while   but as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant   conclusion on balance i would say get the other card   your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above     having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible    in the uk the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers   of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent still this can be quite cheap credit much much cheaper than the headline apr rates actually associated with the cards   the catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off   usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate   but these pitfalls are easily avoided pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses so having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice   you can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer and then simply not use that card for any purchases while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

you have interpreted the instructions correctly the issue with two jobs at the same time is that that second job will be taxed at the highest rate but the second employer has no idea what the other position is paying you   if you make enough to be in the 15 tax bracket for your main job that means some of the money from each paycheck is   taxed zero some is taxed at 10 and the last dollars are taxed at 15 but the second job should withhold for taxes to cover all the income at 15 to avoid problems you should look at the tax form you are filling out this year look at the total tax you paid not the refund or the amount you owed when you filed but your total tax paid the government allows a safe harbor if you make sure that in 2016 you have the same amount withheld this calendar year if that is n't enough you will owe money in april 2017 but you will not have to pay a penalty after you have a couple of paycheck from your main employer check to see that if you work the rest of the year at that same rate that the federal withholding will make the safe harbor if you will make it   you do n't have to worry about the penalty if you will fall short adjust the w-4 accordingly

of course i know nothing about real estate or owning a home i would love to hear people 's thoughts on why this would or would not be a good idea are there any costs i am neglecting i want the house to be primarily an investment is there any reason that it would be a poor investment   i live and work in a college town but not your college town you like many students convinced to buy are missing a great many costs there are benefits of course there 's a healthy supply of renters and you get to live right next to campus but the stuff next to campus tends to be the oldest and therefore most repair prone property around which is where the bad neighborhood vibe comes from a lot of the value of your property would be riding on government policy could involve drastic cuts to their size in the near future and student loan reform could backfire and become even less available even city politics comes into play when property developers lobby city council to your neighborhood for apartments you could end up either surrounded with cheaper units or possibly eminent i 've seen both happen in my college town if you refuse to sell you could find yourself facing an oddly high number of rental inspections for example so on to the general advice firstly real estate in general does n't reliably increase in value at best it tends to track inflation most of the flipping and such you saw over the past decade was a prolonged bubble which is slowly and reliably tanking    beyond that property taxes insurance pmi and repairs need to be factored in as well as income tax from your renters and if you leave the home and continue to rent it out it 's not a owner occupied property anymore which is part of the agreement you sign and determines your interest rate there 's also risks if one of your buddies loses their job wrecks their car or loses financial aid you may find yourself having to eat the loss or evict a good friend or if they themselves just for an example alcohol poisoning it could land on your homeowners insurance or maybe the plumbing breaks and you 're out an expensive repair finally there are significant costs to transacting in real estate you can expect to pay like 5 6 percent of the price of the home to the agents and various fees to inspections it will be exceedingly difficult to recoup the cost of that transaction before you graduate you 'll also be anchored into managing this asset when you could be pursuing career opportunities elsewhere in the nation take a quick look at three houses you would consider buying and see how long they 've been on the market that 's months of your life dealing with this house in a bad neighborhood

if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers   so what i 'm getting from all of this is basically how we view the possibility of a workable flat currency   i think the possibility of whether or not a flat currency will actually work depends on many things some more important than others the size and power influence of a country can greatly affect how a flat currency will work within that country   if the country is large and power hungry like ours then a flat currency will most likely not work in the long run it will promote greed and monopolization of wealth but what of gold that ca n't work either because a large country ca n't sustain itself off such an inefficient monetary system   so to me it seems like extremely large countries should be split into smaller countries that can actually use flat currencies or gold without all of the potential for corruption   this same sort of logic applies to our cousins if a tribe of gets too large the group will split to relieve social tension   this is a big part of why i support ideas like   do you think there is a way for monetary systems to work in very large countries

as previously answered the solution is margin it works like this you deposit e.g. usd at your trading company they give you a margin of e.g. so you are allowed to trade with usd   let 's say you buy pieces of a stock at $ 20 usd fully using your limit and the price changes to $ your profit is 5000 $ 0.50 = $ fast money if you are lucky let 's say before the price went up to it had a slight dip down to $ your loss was 5000 $ 0.2 = wait you had just 1000 to begin with you 'll find an email saying margin call or termination notice your shares have been sold at $ and you are out of business the broker willingly gives you this credit since he can be sure he wo n't loose a cent of course you pay interest for the money you are trading with but it 's only for minutes so to answer your question you do n't care when you have your money back the trading company will always be there to give you more as long as you have deposit left i thought no one should get margin explained without the warning why it is a horrible idea to full use the ridiculous high margins some broker offer 1:10 might or might not be fine but is

it 's easy for me to look at an ira no deposits or withdrawal in a year and compare the return to some index once you start adding transactions not so easy here 's a method that answers your goal as closely as i can offer spy goes back to 1993 it 's the most quoted eft that replicates the s&p 500 and you specifically asked to compare how the investment would have gone if you were in such a fund this is an important distinction as i do n't have to adjust for its expense as you would have been subject to it in this fund simply go to yahoo and start with the historical prices easy to do this on a spreadsheet i 'll assume you can find all your purchases inc dates dollars invested look these up and treat those dollars as purchases of spy once the list is done go back and look up the dividends issues quarterly and on the dividend date add the shares it would purchase based on that day 's price of course any withdrawals get accounted for the same way take out the number of spy shares it would have bought remember to include the commission on spy whatever your broker charges   if i 've missed something i 'm sure we 'll see someone point that out i 'd be happy to edit that in to make this wiki worthy   edit due to the nature of comments and the inability to edit i 'm adding this here perhaps i 'm reading the question too perhaps not i 'm reading it as if instead of doing whatever i did i invested in an s&p index fund how would i have performed to measure one 's return against a benchmark the mechanics of the benchmarks calculation are not needed in a comment i offer an example if there were an etf based on some type of black box investing for which the investments were not disclosed at all only day 's end pricing my answer above still applies exactly the validity of such comparisons is a different question but the fact that the formulation of the eft does n't come into play remains in my comment below which i removed i an etf name not intending it to come off as sarcastic for the record if one wishes to start i 'm ok with it

from the comments it sounds like you have a technical background so i 'm going to suggest you think of this as a technical problem it 's an optimization problem where the variable you 're trying to optimize for is total interest paid over the lifetime of the loans step 1 is making sure you 're using the credit available to you most efficiently if there 's room in the credit limit for card 1 to move more of your debt there then definitely move your balances from the higher interest cards however be careful some cards will have different interest rates for balance transfers or cash advances and definitely do n't move any principal from card 3 until the 0 interest rate expires pursuing a bank loan as part of step 1 is valid as well you could start with the bank you use for your checking account today credit unions can be a good source of lower interest loans as well ensure that you fully understand the terms and interest rates particularly if they change just be careful about applying for them too many can affect your credit rating negatively you also mention in the comments that you 're paying her mortgage i do n't know how the ownership is set up there but either refinancing or taking out a home equity loan can be a way to consolidate debt the interest rate on a home loan will almost assuredly be less than on your higher rate cards especially taking the tax deduction into account step 2 is paying down the debt efficiently the rule here is simple pay the minimum payment on all cards except for the one with the highest interest rate any money you have above the minimum payments should go into paying down the principal on that one in your case that 's card 2   good luck

brokers usually have this kind of information you can take a look at interactive brokers for instance you are interested in the initial margin which in this case is $ so you need that amount to buy sell 1 future in the contract specification you see the contract is made for 100 ounces at the current price $ that would be a total of $ 180,000 it is equivalent to saying you are getting 30x leverage if you buy 1 future and the price goes from $ 1,800 to $ the contract would go from $ 180,000 to $ you make $ 5,000 or a 82 return i am pretty sure you can imagine what happens if the market goes against you   futures are great when your timing is perfect

the previous answers make valid points regarding the risks and why you ca n't reasonably compare trading for profit loss to a roll of the die this answer looks at the math instead your assumption i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss is incorrect for the reasons stated in other answers however the answer to your question can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do worst than random is yes but only because the question is flawed consequently it 's throwing people in all directions with their answers but quite simply in a truly random environment the worst case scenario no matter how improbable is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left this can happen in sequential rolls of the dice and in trading securities bonds whatever you could guess wrong for every roll of the die and all of your stock picks could become worthless both outcomes result in $ 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit tell me which $ 0 is worse given the infinite number of plays that random implies the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios and that is enough by itself to make neither option worse than the other of course the opposite is also true you could only pick winners with an unlimited upside potential but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks it 's just highly improbable my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit nope this is where it all falls apart just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other regression to the mean when given infinite truly random outcomes makes it impossible to have an edge also probabilistically is n't a word but probably is

i can only imagine the regulatory difficulty you 're going through and for that i empathize first bankers everywhere mostly do not know if a bank policy is due to regulation or internal rules   other banks may be more flexible but only the most reputable should be used re paypal they first deposit 1 usd and then withdraw it but things may be different in cyprus   also paypal now has debit cards so if paypal is permitted to issue cards in russia then it could presumably be used in cyprus   again local regulation notwithstanding   paypal now has phone support at the very back of their site so i suggest a call to them in countries that permit western union can be used to wire money into an account from cash the bitcoin route should be used as a last resort   you could wake up tomorrow 25 easy   the regulations are a distant second compared to this problem with all of the above methods there will be varying delays from days to weeks

i would n't pay down your mortgage faster until you have a huge emergency fund   like two years worth of expenses   once you put extra money toward principal you ca n't get it out unless you get a heloc which costs money   you 're in a position now to build that up in a hurry   i suggest you do so your mortgage is excellent   in the land of inflation it gets easier and easier to make that fixed dollar payment depreciating dollars you seem like a go   once you have your huge emergency fund why not buy a few websites and monetize the heck out of them   or look for an investment property from someone who needs to sell desperately get a cushion that you can do something with

as average house prices continue to rise almost 40 of homes in the uk are purchased with cash stage 1 finding a property you can afford stage 2 making an offer stage 3 organise a solicitor and stage 4 the offer and mortgage in your case cash with proof of funds balance due at closing stage 5 exchanging contracts stage 6 completion and final steps you do n't need to prove where the money came from but as you have said that you are a cash buyer you do need to be able to prove that you have the cash to buy the house so assuming you have the money in an account with a bank or building society you should be able to satisfy your solicitors by showing them a recent bank statement or passbook which clearly shows that you have whatever amount it is in cash

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

at the current rates stated in the question i would push additional funds towards your stafford loans as their higher interest rates will incur interest charges almost 3 times faster than your private loans with my loans i have not seen much information regarding private loans jumping the interest rate close to the 6.8 any time in the coming years if others have insight to this i look forward to the comments   due to the private loans being variable there is an element of risk to their rates increasing another way to look at it may be to prorate your amount of extra payments according to their interest rate   $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your stafford loans $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your private loans

this is kind of halfway between the stuff i was talking about and halfway to the stuff i do n't want to get into but it raises some very legitimate and relevant points that are kind of separate from the gold standard debate    the big question taking the banks out of it is a two fold one that goes something like this    is it possible to have a modern economy without credit markets and   is it possible to have functional credit markets without some sort of fractional reserve currency   for example let 's say toyota decides to design a new car before they can sell a single unit someone in africa or somewhere has to dig up the minerals to make it someone has to design it tools have to be re worked all that kind of stuff building one car of a new design might cost a billion dollars or wiki    obviously it 's not realistic for toyota to expect the first customer to pay that much they amortize the design and tooling costs over the expected production run or whatever moreover we might say that only companies that have amassed a billion dollars in physical gold from previous sales should be able to do that kind of thing   but there is a relevant question of whether this makes any kind of sense should toyota have to literally ship or of physical gold through middlemen and suppliers to the miner in africa down to the actual guy who digs up the aluminum or whatever in order to make this transaction happen    how would that work without some sort of intermediary promises    i 'm imagining a scenario where toyota sends an armored truck full of gold out to go find half a ton of aluminum the drivers can not rely on any promises or fractional reserve they must only trade the physical gold in their truck for actual aluminum or expenses along the way    this starts to sanity in a modern economy you have to rely on the promises of middle men and suppliers and contractors and so on and the instant you have promises you have fractional reserves because people are getting paid and money is changing hands that has n't been minted yet    it 's not just the of your local supermarket having to trade a bag full of gold for a shipment of lettuce it 's that contracts to purchase would be meaningless because the driver would have had to give a smaller bag of gold to the supplier who gave a smaller bag of gold to the grower and so on moreover the supermarket would have to just wait to see what entrepreneurial driver shows up and what they have    the supermarket obviously can not order a hundred heads of lettuce per week with a promise to pay not unless we also give the supplier permission to order a hundred heads of lettuce a week from the grower and the grower permission to order seed and hire workers sufficient to grow a hundred heads of lettuce a week and the workers permission to set up car payments to get to work and the seed supplier to so on and so on   that sequence of promises is facto a fractional reserve system with or without a central bank people are promising to deliver gold cash whatever that they do n't currently have moreover it is entirely possible in a gold denominated currency for everyone to keep those promises since the gold like any currency just keeps changing hands and cycling through the economy    your example of gold certificates is exactly equivalent to privately arranged contracts promises to produce a certain amount of gold on completion it 's promises all the way down unless we insist on instant cash transactions e.g. literally handing an employee a dollar 's worth of gold every five minutes or whatever if the employee is counting on the good faith of the employer to settle up at the end of the day or week then we have a fractional reserve system whether or not    when you buy an iphone or a laptop someone had to dig up the stuff to make it out of the ground when you buy a cheeseburger someone had to grow wheat and someone else had to raise and kill a cow it 's not a reasonable proposition that they should wait for you to show up with a bag of gold before doing those things in this day and age    we trade in promises and ious sometimes that sometimes but it 's remarkable how well it does work most of the time and how much better it works than the times and places where people had to trade physical goods for physical goods    this is not an argument against a gold backed currency

your dad may have paid an opportunity cost for that outright purchase   if the money he saved had been invested elsewhere he may have made more money   if he was that well off then his interest rate should have been the lowest possible   my own father is a multi millionaire not myself and he could afford to have paid for his house outright   he did n't though   to do so would have meant cashing in on several investments   i do n't know his interest rate but let 's say it was 2.5   if he invests that million dollars into something he expects to get a 7 return on in the same period then he would make more money by borrowing the money   hence he would be paying an opportunity cost assuming you need to work some jobs will also do background or credit checks   credit cards can be used by well off people to actually make them money by offering rewards compared to straight cash transactions   the better your credit history the better the cards rewards you can get   you can build that credit history better by having these loans and making timely payments

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

yes overall it is a big inconvenience to you this same issue applies for those that for example receive social security benefits and perhaps other government cash benefits on a pre paid card rather than direct deposit to a bank account they allow a few ways to get cash from the card    you can get cash back no fee when you make a retail purchase you could use the card for relatively small items you would purchase anyway and get $ 100 or more back in cash each time every store chain will have it 's own limits on how much cash back they will allow per transaction and be careful some stores charge a fee for cash back but it 's not at all common if even these small purchases are an issue you can then presumably later return the item you purchased without returning the cash back you received if the store allows returns refunds and since a transaction with cash back is processed as a debit rather than a credit usually if you later return the purchased item you will be refunded in cash rather than a credit back to your card account also for other cards sometimes you can go to a branch of the bank that issued the card and make a no fee withdraw sometimes in cash and sometimes by check this depends on the policy of the issuing bank and the card account finally most of this assumes that you are given a pin or the opportunity to create one with the card because cash back and atm access requires a pin and there are some banks cards that do n't allow any of this

if you are really worried your best bet is to move all your cash from sterling into a foreign currency that you think will be resilient should brexit occur i would avoid the euro you could look at the us dollar perhaps make sure you are aware of the charges for moving the money over and back again as you will at some stage probably want to get back into sterling once it settles down if it does indeed fall based on my experience on the stock markets i am not a currency trader i would expect the pound to fall fairly sharply on a vote for brexit and the euro to do the same   both would probably rebound quite quickly too as even if there is a brexit vote it does n't mean the uk government will honour the outcome or take the steps quickly i am not a financial advisor and have no qualifications as such

in addition to the already good answers you also want to consider your time horizon unless you are looking out 10 + years building your down payment in an account that is invested in the market is probably subject to too much market risk are you willing to delay purchasing a home by five years if the market turns down at the wrong time a better option is to just use a savings accounts to avoid spending the money you can open a dedicated account separate savings account for a special purpose are s common feature at credit unions and probably are available at many regular banks as well then for funding the account many employers allow you to split direct deposits amongst multiple accounts so you will just need to provide the routing number and fractional amount of your paycheck for that account

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

if upper and bollinger bands either converge or diverge does that mean the market is trending no bollinger bands measure volatility which is an measure of how much variation there is in the price of the instrument it does not indicate a trend which means that the instrument tends to move in a consistent direction   when bollinger bands are close together that means volatility is relatively low and vice versa they can   be interpreted as signals that a stock might move in one direction or the other but they are not a measure of directional movement

based on your numbers it sounds like you 've got 12 years left in the private student loan which just seems to be an annoyance to me   you have the cash to pay it off but that may not be the optimal solution you 've got $ 85k in cash   that 's way too much so your options are   40k 2.25 loan off mortgage 40k play around with this link mortgage calculator paying the student loan and applying the $ to the monthly mortgage reduces your mortgage by 8 years it also reduces the factor of the student loan prepaying the mortgage one time reduces it by 6 years but that reduces the total cost of the mortgage over it 's lifetime the most prepaying the mortgage and re amortizing it over thirty years at the same rate reduces your mortgage payment by $ 210 which you could apply to the student loan but you 'd need to come up with an extra $ 105 a month

you sound like you 're already doing a lot to improve your situation paying off the credit cards paying off the taxes started your 401k i 'm in a similar situation credit ruined savings gone after the divorce   i know it feels like you 're just spinning your wheels but look at it this way every monthly payment you make on a debt directly increases your net worth   paying those bills regularly is one of the single best things you can do right now as for how you can improve your situation only two things really jump out at me 1 $ 1,300 in rent plus $ 300 in utilities seems quite high for a single man   i do n't know the housing costs in your area though   depending on where you live you could cut that in half while still living alone or get a roommate and save even more   you might have to accept a suboptimal living arrangement like a smaller apartment but we all have to sacrifice at times 2 that last $ 1,000 you really need to budget how it 's being spent   consider cooking at home more eating out less or trading in your car for one with lower insurance premiums   or spending less money on the kids   you say it 's for their entertainment but do n't say what that is are we talking about going to the movies once a month or rock concerts twice a week 3 if the kids are on their own for college it 's not the end of the world   i know you want to provide the best future you can for them help them get good grades and it 'll do more for them than any amount of money after all those any other ways you find to save money even if you can only put a hundred bucks in a savings account at the end of the month and i 'd be surprised if you could n't put five do it   put it in and leave it there despite the temptation to take it out and spend it

in the uk there is a significant difference between taking money out of a bank account and out of a credit card account banks typically require explicit authorisation before they will transfer money out of a bank account for example a direct debit agreement north american banks are much less strict and will transfer your money to any reasonably reputable financial organization who asks for it do n't get me started however credit cards run very differently essentially the onus is on the vendor to get the authorization which is why you can sign a credit card slip at the corner store or give your credit card details over the phone or fill in an online form and have your credit card account charged when you signed the credit card agreement you agreed to let people do this it 's also why the credit card company will reverse a transaction if you claim it was unauthorized so essentially paypal is like the specialty store you phone up to order something and give your credit card details to they have just as much authorization to charge your account your only protection is that the credit card company will investigate any transactions you claim are fraudulent and will reimburse you if it even if they ca n't recover the money themselves

for the type of market neutrality you desire free from crash risk it 's best to hedge the shares with covered calls when implied volatility is expensive and puts when implied volatility is cheap with the nearest at the money expirations   a put only strategy can be very expensive and should only be used with the longest term options available since they can cost many tens of per year securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash therefore market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk this strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion to pay for smaller losses during a crash however the expected long run return hedged this way should be greater than the underlying 's expected long run return with less volatility

there is a highly related question which is much easier to answer what normally value increasing news about a company would cause that company to fall in value in the public stock market by answering that we can answer your question by proxy the answer to that question being anything that makes investors believe that the company wo n't be able to maintain the level of profit for example let 's say a company announces a 300 profit growth compared to the previous year this should push the stock upwards maybe not by 300 but certainly by quite a bit let 's also say that this company is in the business of designing manufacturing and selling some highly useful gadget that lots of people want to buy now suppose that the company managed such an profit increase by one of in scenario 1 firing the engineering department it is highly unlikely that the company will be able to come up with manufacture and sell a next generation gadget hence while profit is up now it is highly likely to go down in the months and years coming up because stock market investors are more interested in future profits than in past profits this should push the value of the company down in scenario 2 selling off the machinery the company may very well be able to come up with a next generation gadget and if they can manufacture it they might very well be able to sell it however no matter how you slice it the short term costs for manufacturing either their current generation gadget or the next generation gadget are bound to go up because the company will either need to rent machinery or buy new machinery neither is good for future profits so the value of the company again should go down in response in scenario 3 their product getting a large boost the company still has all the things that allowed them to come up with produce and sell gadgets they also have every opportunity to come up with manufacture and sell next generation gadgets which implies that future profits while far from guaranteed are likely in this case the probability remains high that the company can actually maintain a higher level of profit hence the value of the company should rise now apply this to a slightly more realistic scenario and you can see why the value of a company can fall even if the company announces for example record profits hence you are looking for news which indicate a present and sustained raised ability to turn a profit this is the type of news that should drive any stock up in price all else being equal obviously buyer beware your mileage may vary all else is never equal nothing ever hits the average you are fighting people who do this type of analysis for a living and have every tool known available to them etc etc but that 's the general idea

yes you often can buy stocks directly from the company at little or no transaction cost   many companies have either a dividend reinvestment plan drip or a direct stock plan   with these plans you purchase shares directly from the company although often there is a third party transfer agent that handles the transaction and the stock is issued in your name   this differs from purchasing stock from a broker where the stock normally remains in the name of the broker generally in order to begin participating in a drip you need to already be a registered stockholder   this means that you need to purchase your first share of stock outside of the drip and get it in your name   after that you can register with the drip and purchase additional shares directly from the company   if the company has a you can begin purchasing shares directly without first being a stockholder with the advent of discount brokers drips do not save as much money for regular investors as they once did   however they can still sometimes save money for someone who wants to purchase shares on a regular basis over even a discount broker if you are interested in drips and and want to learn more there is an informative website at that has lots of information on which drips are available and how to get started

see if the bank has other credit cards they offer many banks have multiple ones some cards have great benefits others do not some cards have high rates some do not some cards are secured some do not   if they have a card that you like ask them to switch you to the card you want they should be able to do so very easily your card number will change but they will treat it is a replacement so that your credit score will not take a hit during the switch it may be possible to get them to waive the annual fee but most wo n't because each card type they offer are separate products so they only allow you to pick one of their options if they do n't have a card to your liking apply for a card from anther bank that has the benefits and annual fees zero that you are looking for it may be that the new card will start with a lower limit but it will increase over time especially as you shift more of your business to the new card when you cancel the old card before the next year rolls around you will take a small short hit to your credit score but that is ok

you quickly run into issues of what denotes similar and how to construct an appropriate index methodology for example do you group all cb arb funds together globally or separate them by country is long bias equity long short different to no bias and variable bias is a fund that concentrates on sovereign debt more like a macro fund or a fixed income fund and so on by definition hedge funds try not to mimic their peers with varying degrees of success   even if you get through that problem how do you create the index you may not be able to get return numbers for all the similar funds and even if you do how do you weight them by aum or equal weight   there are commercial indices out there barclays msci etc but there 's no one accepted standard and it 's unlikely that there ever will be as a result it 's certainly interesting to look at your performance versus one of these indices and many investors do monitor fund performance this way but to demand strict to one of them is a big ask

what you are doing is neither one   you are simply watching to make sure you do n't overdraw which itself suggests you might be living hand to mouth and not saving   keeping track of your money and budgeting are useful tools which help people get on top of their money   which tends to have the effect of allowing you to save    how much did you spend on groceries last month eating out gas if you were keeping track of your money you could say immediately what you spent and whether that is above or below average and why   how much do you plan to spend in the next 3 months on gas groceries eating out   if you knew the answer to that question then you would have a budget    and if those months go by and your budget proves to have been accurate or you as to what went wrong so you can learn and fix it then your budget is a functioning document that is helping you master your money   certainly the more powerful of the two is the keeping track or accounting of what has happened to you so far    it 's important that you keep track of every penny without letting stuff slip through the cracks    here you can use proper accounting techniques and maybe accounting software just like businesses do where they reconcile their accounting against their bank statements and wallet cash i shortcut that a little   i buy gift cards for mcdonalds panera starbucks etc and buy my meals with those   that way i only have one transaction to log $ 40 mcdonalds gift card instead of a dozen little meals   it works perfectly fine since i know all that money went to fast food   a little more dangerous is that i treat wallet cash the same way logging say two monthly entries of $ 100 to cash rather than 50 little transactions of left $ 1 tip at restaurant   this only works because cash is a tiny part of my overall expenditures not worth accounting   if it added up to a significant part i 'd want accounting on that

according to soros in the of finance exchange rates fluctuations are mostly influenced by sorry i do not have the quote here and i am paraphrasing from the top of my head what i read about a week ago i mention his point of view as he is one of the most successful hedge fund manager ever proved his skills and dealt a lot with currencies this is not just theory as he actively used the above points when managing his fund as explained in the book what i find interesting is that according to him the fundamental reason the balance of trade is not the most influential speculation on future value of currencies is the most influential and these can set trends that can last years also it is key to notice that soros thought foreign exchange markets are wrong most of the time just like he thought stock markets are wrong most of the time a point on which warren buffet and jim rogers also agree from my understanding

this sounds like a fatca issue   i will attempt to explain but please confirm with your own research as i am not a fatca expert if a foreign institution has made a policy decision not to accept us customers because of the foreign financial institution obligations under fatca then that will of course exclude you even if you are resident outside the us   the us government asserts the principle of universal tax jurisdiction over its citizens   the institution may have a publicly available fatca policy statement or otherwise be covered in a new story so you can confirm this is what has happened   failing that i would follow up and ask for clarification you may be able to find an institution that accepts us citizens as investors   this requires some research maybe some legwork of your citizenship is the most certain way to circumvent this issue if you are prepared to take such a drastic step   such a step would require thought and planning   note that there would be an expatriation tax exit tax that deems a disposition of all your assets mark to market for all your assets under irc a less direct but far less extreme measure would be to use an intermediary either one that has access or a foreign entity i.e. non us entity that can gain access   a non financial foreign entity is itself subject to withholding rules of fatca so it must withhold payments to you and any other us persons   but the investing institutions will not become by paying an the obligation rests on the pwc australia has a nice little writeup that explains some of the key terms and concepts of fatca of course the simplest solution is probably to use us institutions where possible   non foreign entities do not have foreign obligations under fatca

when an ipo happens the buyers pay some price let 's say $ 20 per share and the seller the company receives a different price $   who paid the commission well the commission caused a spread between buyer and seller   it does n't matter who technically pays the commission because it costs both parties   in an ipo the company technically pays the commission but they use buyers money to do it and the buyer must pay more than he she would if there was no commission the same thing happens when you buy a home   technically the seller pays both realtors commissions but it came from money the buyer gave the seller and the commissions pushed up the price so did n't the buyer pay the commission   they both did the second paragraph suggests that if the investment bankers act as a simple broker buying public securities instead of newly issued shares for their clients then the commissions will be much lower   obviously   i wonder if this is really the right interpretation though as no broker charges 4 to a large client for this service   i would need more context to be sure that 's what 's meant the is that ipos generate a lot of money for the investment bankers who act as intermediaries   if you are participating in the transaction that money is in some way coming out of your pocket even if it does n't show up as a brokerage fee on your statement

with 150 k € to invest to become a landlord you have several options pay for 100 of one property and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month that profit can be used to invest in other things or to save to buy additional properties at the end of the 21 years in your example you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses or even better make a profit because the property went up in value pay 20 down on 5 flats and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one at the end of the 21 years sell the flats assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell something in between 1 and 5 flats each has different risks and expenses with 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company which will add to your monthly cost

this is a good question and my answer below being the first rationale that crossed my mind is far from fleshed out it 's just a reply based on many books on the historical cycles of markets and it 's something i 've discussed at work i work in finance    historically we can observe that periods of financial booms high valuations of public equities tend to lead to lower returns it 's a fairly simplistic notion but if you 're paying more now for something when it 's potentially close to a high water mark then you 're returns in the short term are likely to be somewhat returns from the underlying companies have a hard time keeping up with high valuations such that investors are n't likely to see a return in the short run

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

there are two ways to handle this the first is that the better brokers such as charles schwab will produce summaries of your gains and losses using historical cost information as well as your trades on a monthly and annual basis these summaries are ready made for the irs more brokers will provide these summaries come 2011 the second is that if you are a frequent trader see irs rulings for what constitutes one then they 'll allow you to use the net worth method of accounting that is you take the account balance at the end of the year subtract the beginning balance adjust the value up for withdrawals and down for and the summary is your gain or loss a third way is to do all your trading in say an ira which is taxed on distribution not on stock sales

i will start with the assumption that you will never have any late payments and will fully pay off the loan this may be a big assumption but if you ca n't assume that then you would n't have asked the question in the first place the answer depends on your income you should calculate how much student loan interest you can deduct before and after the switch and adjust the interest rate accordingly to compensate for any difference

this is the best tl;dr i could make tom lee weighs sees bitcoin going as high reduced by 80 i 'm a bot gt the case for bitcoin is a basic supply and demand story similar to the argument other proponents of bitcoin use when playing up its future as gold   gt while the lack of regulation is what has attracted many buyers many consider bitcoin the three years ago gox the largest bitcoin exchange then filed for bankruptcy and said it lost 750,000 of its users bitcoins and 100,000 of the own   gt lee acknowledged volatility in his report noting that annualized bitcoin volatility is 75 percent higher than 10 but as noted volatility approached 90 from 1971 to 1980 as the u.s. abandoned the gold standard hence we expect this to improve over time    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords bitcoin**^#1

most people advocate a passively managed low fee mutual fund that simply aims to track a given benchmark say s&p 500 few funds can beat the s&p consistently so investors are often better served finding a no load passive fund first thing i would do is ask your benefits rep why you do n't have an option to invest in a fidelity passive index fund like spartan 500 ideally young people would be heavy in equities and slowly divest for less risky stuff as retirement comes closer and rebalance the portfolio regularly when market swings put you off risk targets few people know how to do this and actually do so so there are mutual funds that do it for you for a fee these in are called lifecycle funds the freedom funds here   i hesitate to recommend them because they 're still fairly new if you take a look at underlying assets these things generally just reinvest in the broker 's other funds which themselves have expenses fees and there 's all kinds personal situations that might lead to you place a portion with a different investment

nice attempt at trying to obfuscate the math by suggesting your wage was half of what you actually got paid    you were paid $ 9/hr not $ 4.50    was your ceo spending billions of other people 's money playing when he could have been paying his employees instead

it is illegal    coverage has a lot of minimum requirements       what has really hurt obamacare is that it groups those that were formerly uninsured with those that do n't have employer insurance       it turns out those that were previously uninsured often very poor are very expensive to insure    so that has forced up premiums on everyone else        the link of health insurance to employment in the us is to blame   the sooner everyone is forced to buy their own insurance and then preferably the government offers medicare buy in for all the sooner the system can be cleaned up

the question is for your hr department or administrator of the plan how long must you hold the employee shares before you are permitted to sell loyalty to your company is one thing but after a time you will be too heavily invested in one company and you need to diversify out one can cite any number they wish 5 10 all i know is that when enron blew up it only added insult to injury that not only did these people lose their job they lost a huge chunk of their savings as well

the other thing that you may or may not be considering is the fact that when she moves or otherwise ceases to live in that condo you could then rent the unit out to others at the inflation adjusted rent price for the area you could continue to build equity in the property for a fraction of the cost and it would continue to be a tax write off once your mother is not living there while you have more maintenance and repairs cost when renters live there typically anyway if inflation continues to carry on at about 4 5 then you would be potentially renting the unit out at between $ 2,500 and $ by the 10th year from now obviously there are other considerations to be made as well but those are some additional factors that do n't seem to have been addressed in any of the above comments

gt did n't these guys get their covers blown your statement itself   how i 'm saying cash can be used just the same and the point of bitcoin is anonymous glosses over the logistics of purely anonymous trade the second you come out of the into the real word which you flat out must unless you intend to trade in small amounts and never pay taxes trade for anything in the light then the chain will be follow able back to the invisible now not so anonymous wallet ie the wallet is only anonymous if it only does business with other wallets that stay in the which does n't happen and does n't happen with cash either see panama papers   gt   also offshore banking safe havens frequently give away records to authorities which most recently led to arrest of piracy website admins e.g.   right which is the same as bitcoin ie bitcoin does n't fund terrorism anymore than cash does and is no harder or easier to discern one from the other = therefore the comparison is stupid and theater for the stupid

income tax was seen as a way to exploit the revenues available from the rapidly expanding ranks of people with mid to high incomes it was initially targeted at the very wealthy previously most federal revenues came from excise taxes and tariffs both of which have many negative economic effects leave the government with limited revenue generating ability and bring a host of international and domestic political problems   since the successful implementation of the income tax required a constitutional amendment it is very unlikely that anyone at the time seriously considered the income tax a temporary measure

credit cards always charge for withdrawing cash because if they did n't then you could have an indefinite loan and pay no interest simply by withdrawing enough cash each month to pay off the previous month 's bill before the due date it 's nothing to do with using an atm they 'll charge you for getting a cash advance over the counter as well
