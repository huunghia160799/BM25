i 'm not sure why you think that it matters that the distribution goes to an s corp vs an individual tax payer you seem to think it has any relevance to your question but it does n't it only confuses your readers the situation is like this llc x is deriving income in state 2 it has two members i and s residents of state 1 members i and s pay all their taxes to state 1 and do n't pay taxes to state 2 state 2 audited member i and that member now needs to pay back taxes and penalties to state 2 on income derived from that state your question does that mean that member s should be worried since that member was essentially doing the exact same thing as member i my answer yes

i do n't see that this system is very effective at rewarding productivity which particularly in software is an inherently difficult thing to judge that 's why we 've traditionally relied on human managers to make judgments between personnel in regards to compensation   but yeah you bet i 'm selfish if i can get paid more than someone else for doing the same job i 'm going to do it and i 'd prefer to work somewhere that allows me to do that

first of all kudos to you for seeing the value in saving at a young age there are several different things you can mean by this and i 'm not sure which is accurate so i am going to address the first two that i thought of if you are selling your investments because you need the money emergency expenses saved enough for a short term goal whatever the reason then this may not be the best solution for your savings   investing in mutual funds etfs stocks 401k ira etc are typically for longer term goals such as a goal that is 10 + years away maybe buying a home paying for college for your children retirement etc if you are selling your investments because you believe that another investment is performing better and you want to get in on that one instead what i would suggest is leaving the money you have invested where it is and starting future investments in the new fund etf you are interested in   for example if you have $ 2000 invested in fund x and now you do some research and fund q looks more appealing that is great start investing in fund q with your next deposit   any research you do will be based on past results there is nothing that guarantees that fund q will continue doing better than the fund x you already have   trying to time the market rarely ends well for the investor i would encourage you to continue saving money a bit at a time just like you have been doing   avoid selling your investments until it is time to sell them for whatever goal you intended them for   set aside some cash to cover any unexpected expenses so you wo n't have to sell your investments to cover the costs even at 18 unplanned things happen

i will answer this question broadly for various jurisdictions and also specifically for the us given the op 's tax home generally for any tax jurisdiction if your tax system relies on periodic prepayments through the year and a final top up refund at the end of the year ie basically every country you have 3 theoretical goals with how much you pre pay specifically for the u.s. all information gathered from here in short depending on your circumstance you may need to pay quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid penalties on april 15th even if you wo n't be penalized you may benefit from doing so anyway to force yourself to save the money necessary by april 15th   i have translated the general goals above into us specific advice

cash flow is needed for expansion either to increase manufacturing capacity or to expand the workforce other times companies use it to purchase other companies microsoft and google have both used their cash or stocks to purchase companies examples by google include youtube google earth and now part of motorola to expand into phones if you are investing for the future you do n't want a lot of dividends they do bring tax issues that is not a big problem if you are investing in an ira or 401k. it is an issue if the non tax mutual fund distributes those dividends via the 1099 forcing you to address it on your taxes each year some investors do like dividends but they are looking for their investments to generate cash who would require it would it be an sec requirement even more government paperwork for companies

comcast is always hiring and they pay pretty well i know someone that i work with now who worked at comcast as a commercial he traveled a couple times a year but each time it was to some awesome island    take note however that he was laid off so layoffs are a possibility there    also if you are willing to take part time work which if you have only debts and no wife or child i absolutely suggest sacrificing your credit for a few years for this opportunity i highly recommend getting on with ups or usps you will start part time and work your way up to full time making over $    also do n't forget about truck driving long haul truck driving pays around $ 55,000 your first year most companies will train you so long as you sign up for a one year contract some companies are central refrigerated knight trucking gordon trucking swift transport etc this is always an option and i intended on doing this before having formed a family but alas also trucking can lead to better more local jobs

it might not be for first time payers but they do have programs some federal some local that help the poor and elderly complete their tax forms there are also programs that allow the poor to file electronically for free for most people the first time they file their taxes they are using the ez form which is rather easy to do even without the use of either web based or pc based software the software tools all ask enough questions on the ez forms to allow the user to know with confidence when their life choices have made it advantageous to use the more complex forms the web versions of the software allow the taxpayer to start for free thus reducing their initial investment for the software to zero because the first time filer is frequently a teenager the parents are generally responsible for proving that initial guidance   the biggest risk for a young taxpayer might be that the first year that itemizing deductions might be advantageous they might never consider it so they over pay or they discover in april that if they had only kept a receipt from a charity six months ago they could deduct the donation so they are tempted to   claim the donation without proof regarding and assistance there is an interesting tax credit the earned income tax credit it gives a tax credit to the working poor they alert people that they need to check your eligibility for the earned income tax credit they know that significant numbers of taxpayers fail to claim it eitc can be a boost for workers who earned $ or less in 2012    yet the irs estimates that one out of five eligible taxpayers fails to    claim their eitc each year the irs wants everyone who is eligible for    the credit to get the credit that they ’ve earned the rules for getting the credit are simple all the information needed to claim it is already on the basic tax forms but you have to know that you need a separate form to get the credit but instead of making the credit automatic they say if you use irs e file to prepare and file your tax return the    software will guide you and not let you forget this important step    e file does the work and figures your eitc for you and then   with irs free file you can claim eitc by using brand name tax    preparation software to prepare and e file your tax return for free    it 's available exclusively at irs.gov free help preparing    your return to claim your eitc is also available at one of thousands    of volunteer income tax assistance sites around the country to find    the volunteer site nearest to you use the locator tool on    irs.gov but if you do n't use free file you might never know about the form apparently it escapes 20 of the people who could claim it

as the premiums go up so do the individuals subsidies because they are limited in how much they have to pay john has to pay $ 450 if his total insurance costs $ 11k or $ 15 k. so in effect he will get more money to pay for his increased insurance costs    this increases the overall costs to the taxpayers by millions of dollars the money goes to the person to pay premiums instead of straight to insurance companies    the taxpayers would be much better off if the payments to insurance companies continue to prevent the raise in premiums if trump stops the payments we are all going to pay more except for those near the poverty level

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

i 'm going to assume that you want to be invested all the time and each trade consists in selling a security and buying another one similar to your example how much commissions you are willing to pay depends on several factors but one way to think about it is as follows you have a position in stock a and you want to switch to stock b because you think it will perform better if you think there 's a good chance > 50 that b will outperform a by more than x% then you can happily pay up to commissions and still make money over a long time horizon if you like formulae one way to express it is where example if you tend to be right 51 of the time hit rate and gain 110 more than you lose on average win loss ratio you can see that your expected profit is 5.1 commissions so you could pay 2.5 commissions on entering and closing the position and still make money*. unfortunately common sense statistics and numerous studies tell us a sad truth on average people have a hit rate of 50 and a win loss ratio of 100 which means that their expected profit per trade is 0 commission based on that crude observation unless you can prove to yourself that you are better than average you should aim at reducing commissions paid to your broker as much as possible through 51 and 110 are not random numbers they correspond to the results of the top 15 professional managers in a research paper using a sample of funds managing $

can a company not bargain with a dying company for example and buy a    falling stock at lower than market value of course if the shareholders agree to it but why would they if the market value is higher agree to sell to someone who offers less if there 's a compelling reason it can happen it might happen during a hostile takeover for example in the case of buying the company for more than market value are the    stocks bought for significantly more or slightly more than the    current market value again depends on how valuable the shareholders think the company is if the shareholders think that the company has a potential which has not yet affected the stock price they 'll want a higher premium and they 'd think that otherwise why would they hold the stock how much higher depends on the bargaining abilities of the sides

in my opinion the ability to set a sell or buy price is the least of my concerns   your question of whether to choose individual stocks vs funds prompts a different issue for me to bring to light choosing stocks that beat the market is not simple in fact a case can be made for the fact that the average fund lags the market by more and more over time in the end that fact and going with the lowest cost funds or etfs will beat 90 of investors over time

are there any monthly administrative fees on those loans that are charged separately if not you should just pay as much as you can as quick as you can to get the loan amount down on those loans with the highest interest rate if there are no separate fees on the loans then it 's just a lump of money with some interest rate the smaller loans will eventually drop away one by one have a celebration to remark the occasion when that happens i assume the payment is split evenly between the loans restructure if you get a better deal from someplace   delay buying new stuff until you get the loan amount down pay as much as you can as quickly as you can but keep enough money in your pocket to survive a month or two so that you do n't need to get any more loans in case something unexpected happens

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

note too that being a contractor means that you will have periods between contracts you tend to be out of work more often than a salaried employee would you need to set your rates so your average income including those down times adds up to a living wage including all those benefits that are n't being covered if a company hires a contractor they understand that this is part of the trade off they avoid making a long term commitment when they do n't have a long term need and they accept that this convenience may cost a bit more in the short term

salaries normally should n't fluctuate with inflation and deflation inflation prevents consumers from spending prices get too high ultimately taking money out of circulation this causes the market to go in to deflation or at least deflate back to normal that 's when people begin to spend again and start the cycle all over again now imagine if salaries increased with inflation inflation would never end everyone could keep affording the high prices a starbucks coffee would eventually cost $ 150 but the middle class would all be millionaires your small change would consist of a wad of useless bills and the government would have to continually print out more money just to keep up note this is not a direct answer to where goes delta but would more be directed to the part prices go up and salary does n't

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

the house that sells for $ 200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers 3 would be $ or $ 500/mo this is absurdly low and favors renting not buying 9 is $ in which case buying the house to live in or rent out as a landlord is the better choice at this level paying rent should be avoided   i 'm simply explaining the author 's view not advocating it   a quote from the article   annual rent purchase price = 3 means do not buy prices are too    high annual rent purchase price = 6 means borderline annual rent purchase price = 9 means ok to buy prices are    reasonable edit to respond to chuck 's comment mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high the 30 year is about 4.4 and the 15 of course a number of factors might mean paying more but this is the average rate and it changes over time but the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different very different based on location see what you 'd pay for 2000 sq feet in manhattan vs a nice town in the mid west one can imagine a heat map when an area might show an $ 800 rent on a house selling for $ 40,000 as a the home price divided by annual rent and another area as a 20 where the $ 200 k house might rent for $ it 's not homogeneous through the us as i said i 'm not taking a position just discussing how the author formulated his approach the author makes some assertions that can be debatable e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high in my opinion the us has had the crash but the rates are still low buying is a personal decision and the own rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision   of course the article as written does the math based on the rates at time of publication and the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate the $ 60 k couple at 4 can afford just over a $ 260 k mortgage but at 6 $ k and 8 $ the struggle is n't with the payment but the downpayment    the analysis is n't too different for a purchase to invest if the rent exceeds 1 of the home price an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

you could buy options i do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn there are weekly monthly quarterly yearly and even longer duration options called leaps you have decided how long of a time frame you also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently today is hypothetically a thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on friday the next day of strike and the call option is priced at cents and you buy it this means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0 the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying say the spy moved 55 cents up from 100 to minus the strike = 5 cents so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents you lost almost 91 of your money rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less the leverage is on a 10x scale typically that is why timing is so important anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future but if you know when you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market another thing you can do is figure out how much msft contributes to the spx movement in terms of points what does a 1 move in msft spx if you can calculate that and you think you know where msft is going you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft you could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor but be careful like said look into an etf that has microsoft the nasdaq has a which microsoft is in called the triple q. the ticker is qqq qqq ™ formerly known as qqq or the 100 index tracking stock ® is an exchange traded fund based on the index ® best of luck and always understand what you are buying before you buy it

section 8 housing at least these days is a scam meant to funnel poor and into shitty areas and shitty housing away from the wealthy affluent areas that have decent jobs and services int he 70s people on assistance which includes lots of minorities were entering into middle class or better white neighborhoods and making racists and angry so then they decided people on section 8 were spending too much money on rent and instead moved them to cheaper section 8 housing blocks of course areas purposefully concentrated with people all on government assistance would never flourish economically but it does make the surrounding land cheaper thus you can build and cram even more section 8 people into that area and get paid by the government to do it   unsurprisingly you do n't have a flourishing economy in an area mainly composed of poor people with the cheapest and shittiest housing they can legally make no businesses want to move there so crime rates go up and desirability keeps going down

why are there taxi regulations in the first place i mean if uber was able to provide such a comparable service without taxi regulations then why do we need them obviously the people have spoken with their wallets and i do n't think uber has killed or seriously hurt me if i 'm wrong    as far as i 'm concerned the only reason these regulations exist is to make cabs more expensive and give the local government more money from cabs as a service but uber actually creates a lower burden on the government because they have ride sharing which means that less people are on the roads which is definitely a good thing    please tell me i 'm wrong i 'm genuinely asking

note the answer below is speculative and not based on any first hand knowledge of pump and dump schemes the explanation with spamming does n't really makes sense for me often you see a stock jump 30 or more in a single day at a particular moment in time unlikely that random people read their emails at that time and decide to buy what i think happens is the does a somewhat risky thing starts buying a lot of shares of a stock that has declined a lot and had low volumes during the previous days as the price starts to increase other people start to notice the jump and join the buying spree also do n't forget that some probably use buy stop orders which are triggered when the price reaches a particular level also there should be some automatic trading involved maybe hft firms do pump and dumps as you have to trade a big volume in a relatively short time span i think it is unlikely to be done by human operators another explanation would be that there is a group of to spread the risk so to speak update as i think more of it it is not necessary to buy a lot of shares you could buy some shares sell them to another and buy from them again at a higher price in several iterations i think this could also work if you do it fast enough these scheme makes sense only you previously bought many shares at the low price possibly during several weeks once the price is pumped high enough you can start selling the shares you previously bought in the days preceding the pump

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

in a free market supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity price is one of the variables that demand   but the problem is employment is n't a free market you can not freely decide not to accept a job because you need some income to live    the wage of an employee especially at the unskilled tier is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs and better yet those jobs can be into shifts and so you can employ more people for less hours or vice versa    the employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result and it 's only connected to the free market of the value of service of a burger    so i 'd guess the market value would steadily drop to about the cost of living in the local area maybe a little below even because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family and further still you can have people themselves by working additional hours    so i reckon you 'd get equilibrium at about 90 of local cost of living if you work an 80 hour week

it 's not non zero but in a resource extraction economy the prices of those resources is critical   alberta which produces a lot of expensive oil needs the prices to be above a certain amount or there are major problems     prior to 2008 everything was wine and   after the crash the elected government has been crying   instead of funding everything through oil royalties in a surplus they 've made cutbacks and run a sizeable deficit most every year since   the lower prices has resulted in slowed construction and cancelled projects on the oil sands which reduces the jobs which undercuts the only positive to practically giving the oil away   this is with $ 32 billion is subsidies for oil and gas each year   reduced jobs and money means less demand for real estate which tripled between 2003 and 2008 and has mostly held steady since then   with rising interest rates on the horizon many could lose of their wealth   if an oil produces wanted to hurt alberta increasing production enough to drop the price of oil by $ could do it   i know it 's a tall order but there are certain countries and/or organizations that could do it   the us govt for example could have its oil barons and military hawks team up to subsidize production enough to sink russia in the name of national security   it may not make much sense but neither does ethanol from corn and look where that is

capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods an asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less and sold at a loss will create a short term capital loss a sale of any asset held for over a year to your day and sold at a loss will create a loss that is long term when capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories then the gains that are long term losses are netted against each other therefore the same is done for short term gains and losses then your net gain that is long term loss is netted against the net short term gain or loss this final net number is then reported on form 1040 example frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year short term gains $ 6,000 long term gains $ 4,000 short term losses $ 2,000 long term losses $ 5,000 net short term gain loss $ 4,000 st gain $ 6,000 st gain $ 2,000 st loss net long term gain loss $ 1,000 lt loss $ 4,000 lt gain $ 5,000 lt loss final net gain loss $ 3,000 short term gain $ 4,000 st gain $ 1,000 lt loss    again frank can only deduct $ 3,000 of final net short- or long term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance

making these difficult portfolio decisions for you is the point of target date retirement funds   you pick a date at which you 're going to start needing to withdraw the money and the company managing the fund slowly turns down the of the fund as the target date approaches   typically you would pick the target date to be around say your birthday   many mutual fund companies offer a variety of funds to suit your needs your desire to never have to recover indicates that you have not yet done quite enough reading on the subject of investing   or possibly that your sources have been misleading you   a basic understanding of investing includes the knowledge that markets go up and down and that no portfolio will always go up   some recovery will always be necessary having a less aggressive portfolio will never shield you completely from losing money it just makes loss less likely the important thing is to only invest money that you can afford to lose in the short term with the understanding that you 'll make it back in the long term   money that you 'll need in the short term should be kept in the absolute safest investment vehicles such as a savings account a money market account short term certificates of deposit or short term us government bonds

do i get a write off for paying student loans maybe   see generally personal interest you pay other than certain mortgage interest is n't deductible on your tax return however if your modified adjusted gross income magi is less than $ 80,000 $ 160,000 if filing a joint return there is a special deduction allowed for paying interest on a student loan also known as an education loan used for higher education for most taxpayers magi is the adjusted gross income as figured on their federal income tax return before subtracting any deduction for student loan interest this deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $ 2,500   read the whole document to be sure but that 's the basics    you 'll have to fill out a 1040 or 1040a to claim a student loan deduction   it wo n't be on the 1040ez   you do not have to itemize though    what kinds of write offs and credits are available for someone who is single and lives in an apartment with two roommates as a practical matter in 2016 you 'll get the standard deduction for someone who is single $ 6300 and the personal exemption $ 4050   it 's extremely unlikely that you 'll be able to deduct more by itemizing   most people who itemize are taking a mortgage interest deduction   major medical bills are another possibility but they have to be more than 10 of your adjusted gross income it 's one of the lines on your tax return   assuming you rent and are reasonably healthy you are unlikely to have enough to itemize    the most likely additional deduction would be the one for an ira individual retirement account   although you might be better off doing a roth anyway no tax deduction    if you are self employed or making more than $ 100,000 a year there are additional issues   but most people are n't   if you filled out a w-4 and will get a w-2 back you are n't self employed   hopefully you have a rough idea of your annual income    the first $ over your deductions will pay 10   after that up to $ 37,650 you pay 15   the 2016 link above has a link pdf to the full table if you need more than that   note that that is the first $ 48,000 in income with your $ 10,350 in deductions

gold may have some intrinsic value but it can not be accurately determined by investors by any known valuation techniques in fact if you were to apply the dividend discount model of john williams a variation of which is the basis of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and the basis of most valuation techniques gold would have zero intrinsic value because it produces no cash flow legendary focus investor warren buffett argues that investing in gold is pure speculation because of the reason mentioned above as others have mentioned gold prices are affected by supply and demand but the bigger influence on the price of gold is how the economy is gold is seen as a store of value because according to some it does not lose value unlike paper currency during inflation in inflationary times demand increases so gold prices do go up which is why gold behaves similar to a commodity but has far less uses   it is difficult to argue whether or not gold gains or loses value because we ca n't determine the intrinsic value of gold and anyone who attempts to justify any given price is pulling blinders over your eyes it is that over history gold represents wealth and that in the past century and the last decade gold prices rise in inflationary conditions as people dump dollars for gold and it has fallen when the purchasing power of currency increases many investors have talked about a gold bubble by arguing that gold prices are inflated because of inflation and the fed 's money policy and that once interest rates rise the money supply will contract and gold will fall but again nobody can say with any reasonable accuracy what the fair value of gold at any given point is   this article on seeking alpha gives a quick overview but it is also vague because gold ca n't be accurately priced   i would n't say that gold has zero intrinsic value because gold is not a business so traditional models are inappropriate but i would say that gold certainly does n't have a value of $ 1,500 and it 's propped so high only because of investor expectation   in conclusion i do not believe you can accurately state whether gold is undervalued or overvalued you must make judgments based on what you think about the future of the market and of monetary policy but there are too many variables to be accurate consistently

an amortization schedule is often used to produce identical payments for the term repayment period of a loan resulting in the principal being paid off and the debt retired at the end of the loan this is in contrast to an interest only or balloon loan these loans require little or no payment against the balance of the loan requiring the loan to be paid indefinitely if there is no term or requiring the loan to be entirely paid off from cash or a new loan at the end of the term a basic amortization formula can be derived from the compound interest formula    this formula comes from the wikipedia article on amortization the basics of the formula are the periodic payment amount a your monthly payment can be determined by the principal loan p the rate r and the number of payments n.   lenders lend money to make a profit on the interest they 'd like to get back all the money they lent out amortization schedules are popular because the fixed low payments make it easier for borrowers to pay the loan off eventually they also tend to be very profitable for lenders especially at the start of the term because they make a lot of profit on interest just like the start of your mortgage the principal of a mortgage has more meaning than the principal of a revolving debt credit card the mortgage principal is fixed at the start and represents the value of the collateral property that is your home you could consider the amount of principal paid to be the percentage of your home that you actually own as part of your net worth calculation   a credit card has a new balance each month depending on how much you charge and how much you pay off principal has less meaning in this case because there is no collateral to compare against and the balance will change monthly in this case the meaning of the amortization schedule on your credit card is how long it will take you to pay off the balance if you stop charging and pay at the payment level over the term described given the high interest rate on credit cards you may end up paying twice as much for goods in the long run if you follow your lenders schedule amortizing loans are common for consumer loans unless a borrower is seeking out the lowest possible monthly payment lenders recognize that people will eventually die and want to be paid off before that happens balloon and interest only bonds and loans are more commonly issued by businesses and governments who are hopefully investing in capital improvements that will pay off in the long run thousands of people and businesses have gone bankrupt in this financial crisis because their interest only loans reached term and no one was willing to lend them money anymore to replace their existing loan

sorry for the late reply   gt different erp systems have different mappings but there are no unlimited amount of erp systems   it 's actually close to unlimited reasons   1 even if two customers use the same erp system each implement their erp in a different way   2 even if they implement the erp system exactly the same way the edi is done by an edi and each customer will implement edi in a different way   3 even if it 's the same edi system and map each customer may have different meaning to the same data field for example one customer definition for due date is the date the vendor needs to ship the goods to me while the other customer says it 's the date i want the goods delivered to my warehouse   4 even if all the fields have the exact same definition the values may be different between the 2 customers classic example while customer a use sku for a certain widget made by the vendor the other customer may use sku   5 it 's even worse than you think if say a huge company like wal mart implemented edi orders in its specific way wal mart has 100,000 suppliers so each of those suppliers have to implement the wal mart way of edi orders   6 even worse when wal mart make a change to their edi orders e.g. add a new type of data 100,000 suppliers have to change their system support the new data requirements   do me a favor i only addresses one statement you made can you cut and paste your whole message and post it again in /r edi this is the right subreddit for this discussion you should join it and several people can reply to you   thanks

live with your beloved poor for a year   hahaha there is a housing project directly across the street from me as i write this you keep making assumptions   yes there absolutely is a culture of laziness and irresponsibility there are a lot of reasons that the poor remain poor and this is only one of them other reasons include the drug war which disproportionately targets minorities and creates a vast unemployable population due to their criminal records the school systems are shit how can you raise yourself out of poverty without a decent education unions have declined meaning working class people no longer have a living wage and must rely on food stamps and other government programs just to survive there are a lot of reasons the poor stay poor blaming it all on bad choices is rather short sighted there are public sector private sector and cultural factors contributing to wealth inequality i will admit to all of these but the libertarian ideology only allows for one   plus what are you going to do about it does society have any responsibility to help people who are trapped in a cycle of poverty and bad choices to better themselves what about the newborn child who has made no bad choices but to be born poor fuck 'em   gt;any actual of reality   make one you state no facts only that if there were some facts they would agree with you not a proper argument   gt;the rich are rich for a reason and the poor are poor for a reason   the rich are rich for many reasons personal achievement inheritance luck connections and simply reaping the fruits of a prosperous society there just as many reasons the poor are poor to take any one reason and say that is the only reason is just like taking the idea of property rights and saying that is the only right worth consideration   down inside you do n't think you 've earned it so you want to sacrifice all the rest of us on the of your limp weakness   i do n't attempt to you though i could probably do a much better job having once held the beliefs you are espousing the thing is i learned from my experience and from the world around me i see how the system is rigged in both the public sector and private sector i know it is possible to make it rich in this country if you have the skill and motivation but i also know that it is much easier to stay rich if you are born rich and far too much depends on who you know rather than what you know and nobody would be rich if we did n't have a functioning society with a large middle class that can afford to buy the goods that entrepreneurs invent   as a business owner i want to live in a society where the majority of people can afford the crap that i 'm peddling call me a commie

sure you can deposit cash a few notes apply does the source of cash need to be declared if you deposit more than $ 10,000 in cash or other negotiable instruments you 'll be asked to complete a form called a currency transaction report here 's the us government 's guidance for consumers about this form there 's some very important information in that guidance document about structuring which is a fairly serious crime that you can commit if you break up your deposits to avoid reporting do n't do this the linked document gives examples also do n't refuse to make your deposit and walk away when presented with a ctr form   in addition you are also required to report to customs and border protection when you bring more than $ 10,000 in or out of the country if you are caught not doing so the money may be seized and you could be prosecuted criminally many countries have similar requirements often with different dollar amounts so it 's important to make sure you comply with their laws as well the information from this reporting goes to the government and is used to enforce finance and tax laws but there 's nothing wrong or illegal about depositing cash as long as you do n't evade the reporting requirements you will not need to declare precisely where the cash comes from but they will want the information required on the forms   is it taxable simply depositing cash into your bank account is not taxable receiving some forms of income whether as cash or a bank deposit is taxable if you seem to have a large amount of cash income it is possible an irs audit will want an explanation from you as to where it comes from and why it is n't taxable   in short if the income was taxable you should have paid taxes on it whether or not you deposit it in a bank account what is the limit of the deposit there is no government limit an individual bank may have their own limit and/or may charge a fee for larger deposits you could always call the bank and ask

yes this extra income would be taxed at your marginal rate because it is increasing your total income this does not necessarily apply to all income however capital gains are taxed at a different rate depending on the amount of extra work you may wish to consider setting up a corporation corporations are taxed entirely differently this would also give you the opportunity to write off far more of your expenses but be aware of double taxation investopedia has a good article on double taxation the issue is that the corporation must pay taxes on the revenue and then when you take out the money either as salary or dividends you personally will pay tax it may leave you better off even with the double taxation dividends are taxed at a lower rate than your marginal tax rate generally and you can write off much more inside a corporation if considering this talk to an accountant and discuss your expected revenue from consulting the accountant should be able to quantify the costs and benefits

do n't try because it 's a moving target a thriving economy on paper can be entirely valuation based it tells you nothing about distribution of wealth in the economy the majority would be destitute and we could still be talking of booming times if speculative markets can find creative ways of growing valuations of existing assets with growth all that is needed is for two people to bid a painting to 100 million for the painting to have contributed positively to a growth in the value of goods and services in the economy the same is done with intellectual property and corporate valuations good times are times when capital gains can be seized on account of of credit or government spending recessions are closer when governments try and pull in more than they spend and when lending ca n't expand government spending is these days despite talk of the contrary

as a common shareholder why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because it could increase the value of your existing shares companies sell new shares to raise capital and they use capital to among other things expand if whole foods issues new shares and uses the capital to opens new stores then profit could increase enough to offset the dilution effect and your stock price will go up you should ask yourself   what areas is is your company of choice planning on expanding into will they do well there are there better ways for the company to raise capital debt cash in hand cut expenses elsewhere etc if you think that the management has a good plan for expanding then authorizing new shares makes good sense for you personally

tldr   why ca n't banks give me my money we do n't have your money who has my money about half a dozen different people all over the world and we need to coordinate with them and their banks to get you your money i love how everyone seems to think that the securities industry has super powers   believe me even with t+3 you wo n't believe how many trades fail to settle properly   yes your trade is pretty simple but cash equity trades in general can be very complicated for the layman   your sell order will have been pushed onto an algorithmic platform aggregated with other sell order and crossed with internal buy orders the surplus would then be split out by the algo to try and get the best price based on orders on the market   finally the fills are used in settlement which could potentially have been filled in multiple trades against multiple counterparties in order to guarantee that the money can be in your account we need 3 days also remember we are n't just looking at your transaction each bank is looking to square off all the different trades between all their counter parties over a single day thousands of transactions fills may have to be processed just for a single name finally because there a many many transactions that do not settle automatically our settlements team needs to co with the other bank to make sure that you get your money bear in mind banks being banks we are working with systems that are older than i am and all of the above is the simplest case i have n't even factored in dark pools block trades auctions pre post market trading sessions foreign exchange derivatives kyc aml

in practice it would not work if you put a bid in that was really out of line even if it got filled the exchange would reverse it   other than that it really depends on what the current bid ask spread it and what volume its trading as well as how the market feels say the current bid is 11 and you put an order in with bid 11.5 it would soak up all the orders on the market up to the volume your buying but once your order is filled the market will be determined by what the next order 's bid ask is it might stay where you moved it too if others feels that s a fair price but if every other order on the market is still at 11 then the price is nt gon na move   unless your a market maker you could not realistically affect the price

why there is this huge difference i am not able to reconcile yahoo 's answer of 5.75 even using their definition for of return on assets formula earnings from continuing operations average total equity this ratio shows percentage of returns to total assets of the company    this is a useful measure in analyzing how well a company uses its    assets to produce earnings i suspect the average total equity in their formula is a typo but using either measure i can not come up with 5.75 for any 12-month period i can however match marketwatch 's answer by looking at the 2016 fiscal year totals and using a traditional formula of net income average total assets i 'm not saying that is right and yahoo is wrong mw is using fiscal year totals while yahoo is using trailing 12-month numbers and yahoo uses earnings from continuing operations but even using that number which yahoo calculates i am not able to reconcile the 5.75 they give

leverage amplifies gains and losses when returns are positive leverage makes them more positive but when returns are negative leverage makes them more negative since most investments have a positive return in the long run leverage is generally considered a good idea for long term illiquid investments like real estate   that said to quote keynes in the long run we are all dead in the case of real estate specifically negative returns generally happen when house prices drop assuming you have no intention of ever selling the properties you can still end up with negative returns if rents fall mortgage rates increase or tax rates rise all of which tend to correlate with falling property values also if cash flow becomes negative you may be forced to sell during a down market thereby the loss   besides loss scenarios leverage can turn a small gain into a loss because leverage has a price interest that is subtracted from any amplified gains and added to any amplified losses to give a specific example if you realize a 0.1 gain on x$ when unleveraged you could end up with a 17 loss if leveraged 90 at 2 interest gains loss one reason leveraged investments are popular particularly with real estate is that the investor can file bankruptcy to erase a large negative net worth   this means the down side of a leveraged investment is limited for the highly leveraged investor this leads to a get rich or start over mentality common among the self made millionaire and failed entrepreneurs   unfortunately this dynamic also leads to serious problems for the banking sector in the event of a large nation wide devaluation of real estate prices

there are two common types of p e ratio calculations trailing and forward and then there are various mixes of the two trailing p e ratios are calculated as current price trailing 12-month eps an alternative is the forward p e ratio which is based on an estimate of earnings in the coming 12 months the estimate used is usually called consensus and to answer your question is the average estimate of analysts who cover the stock any reputable organization will disclose how they calculate their financials for example reuters uses a trailing ratio indicated by ttm on their page for bhp so the first reason a pe ratio might not jump on an announcement is it might be forward looking and therefore not very sensitive to the realized earnings the second reason is that if it is a trailing ratio some of the annual eps change is known prior to the annual announcement for example on 12/31 a company might report a large drop in annual earnings but if the bulk of that loss was reported in a previous quarterly report then the trailing eps would account partially for it prior to the annual announcement   in this case i think the first reason is the culprit the reuters p e of nearly 12 is a trailing ratio so if you see 8 i 'd think it must be based on a forward looking estimate

some liquidity since you 're using ib and you seem to be an investor not a trader so you wo n't notice especially if you walk your orders but you will suffer the bid ask spread as everyone else albeit wider    if buying the best strategy unless if one is time constrained is to walk the entire bid from the best bid to the best ask   it is highly likely that someone will hit your order before you hit the best ask   if they do n't as a long term investor the few pennies wo n't make or break you especially if the price per share is 100 usd equivalent but it is an excellent habit to form and fun since you 're buying etfs even though your orders are small you would be adding liquidity to your market helping it become more efficient because your orders could be used to arbitrage against all of the etf 's holdings in turn providing liquidity for those holdings no liquidity this could only be done with an extremely low cost broker like ib because the trading commissions would make it prohibitively expensive there are huge risks when trading an illiquid security such as   would be much less risky thus less expensive securities with no liquidity can be traded but they must be traded very carefully   in the case of a security that can only attract about 20 shares per day in volume only single shares should be bid   the market makers suffering from a dearth in volume may not even be willing to haggle therefore the only recourse is a statistical who will attempt to profit from the spread between other more liquid versions of the security considering the available alternative is not recommended to trade

if you are now in a better position to pay your debts the wise move for your long term credit is to consolidate any high interest debt that remains and pay it off as quickly as possible this may not be possible depending on your situation but one way to get such consolidation loans is to have a parent with good credit cosign as guarantor on the consolidation loan the only way your credit will recover is if you establish a good history of payments over the next seven years frankly i would n't cosign a loan with a family member who made the same decisions you have made because i would n't want to put my own credit at risk but i might loan the money directly which would ease the pain for that family member but it would n't help their credit going forward this may not be a popular opinion but without any details it 's hard for me to agree that any of your creditors are being greedy when they threaten a judgment they loaned you the money in good faith and now you are attempting to negotiate a change of terms   are they greedy because the interest rates are too high maybe you were a bad risk when they loaned the money and the rates reflected the risk of losing some portion of the money the fact that you are trying to discharge some portion of that debt any high rates charged

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

other people have pointed this out but there are a few considerations in whether you should do a roth or traditional ira such as one of the major arguments for using a traditional ira is that you can at least in theory afford to contribute more money initially than you 'd be able to afford if you were using a roth ira while this is in theory true i 'm not at all convinced that using a traditional ira will actually cause people to contribute more to it realistically how many people will actually contribute say $ 500 more to their ira because they knew that their contribution for this year will save them $ 500 to know if this is the case consider the last time that you actually invested some of your tax refund in your retirement account i have n't seen any actual statistics on this but i 'm guessing that very few people do this please see other people 's answers for details on the mathematics behind that the second argument for contributing to a traditional ira is if you expect your future income tax rate to be lower than your current tax rate for some reason e.g. due to a change in government policy e.g. replacing income taxes with value added tax or something like that the fact that you 're doing the contribution relatively close to when you 're planning on withdrawing it etc please see this question for more discussion about this keep in mind that while a traditional ira saves you tax money this year a roth ira saves you money when you withdraw it so it 's not really a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now or $ 5000 later it 's a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now vs. for example $ 50,000 later or however much the money 's grown by the time you withdraw it maybe the traditional ira is still worth it though if there are changes to tax policy or you end up with a lot more money in your traditional ira due to being able to contribute more

how do prices of an apartment house correlate to prices becoming more manageable in manufactured goods   i could also say that   housing is not a good proxy seeing as how prices in housing differ depending on where you live   i can also point out that more is going into buildings like double glass and better materials which would also raise prices on your home   yet a computer is much better than today than 35 years ago and the exact opposite thing happened   i can also say that there is less timber today than 35 years ago making the price of wood go up   i can also get into boring things like bid rent theory but what 's the fun in that   nearly all manufactured goods have gone down in price   thanks to more open robust trade

gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end   means takes the shape of currency in this form we value gold in the same way we value the dollar it allows us to purchase things we want as a medium of exchange gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange for example i would be valuing one of gold to be worth a dog if i traded a dog for one of gold the value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction gold as an end is valued for its own sake a good example of this is a who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic gold possesses this is closer to the true value of gold than using it as a means but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor you know what i could use right now a block of gold said no one ever   but even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake this is usually done because gold provides a function for example if people no longer want to jewelry then a will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends to sum up gold has a perceived value for most people and an intrinsic value to a select few for the time being

first to clear a few things up    it is definitely not a gift the people are sending you money only because you are providing them with a service    and for tax purposes it is not a donation it has nothing to do with the fact that you are soliciting the donation as charitable organizations solicit donations all the time for tax purposes it is not a donation because you do not have 501(c)(3 non profit status    it is income the question is then is it business income or hobby related income    firstly you have n't mentioned but it 's important to consider how much money are you receiving from this monthly or how much money do you expect to receive from this annually    if it 's a minimal amount say $ 50 a month or less then you probably just want to treat it as a hobby mostly because with this level of income it 's not likely to be profitable in that case report the income and pay the tax the tax you will owe will be minimal and will probably be less than the costs involved with setting up and running it as a business anyway as a hobby you wo n't be able to deduct your expenses server costs etc unless you itemize your taxes on schedule a.    on the other hand if your income from this will be significantly more than $ now or in the near future then you should consider running it as a business    get it clear in your mind that it 's a business and that you intend it to be profitable perhaps it wo n't be profitable now or even for a while what 's important at this point is that you intend it to be profitable    the irs will consider if it looks like a business and it acts like a business then it 's probably a business so make it so    come up with a name for your business register the business with your state and/or county as necessary in your location get a bank account for your business get a separate business paypal account keep personal and business expenses and income separate    as a business when you file your taxes you will be able to file a schedule c form even if you do not itemize your taxes on schedule a. on schedule c you list and total your business income and your business expenses then you subtract the expenses from the income to calculate your profit or loss    if your business income is more than your business expenses you pay tax on the difference the profit   if your business expenses are more than your business income then you have a business loss you would not have to pay any income tax on the business income and you may be able to be carry the loss over to the next and following years you may want to have a service do your taxes for you but at this level it is certainly something you could do yourself with some minimal consultations with an accountant

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

a derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind the kind whose price depends on or is derived from another asset   this definition is from john hull options futures and other derivatives a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this you can easily find old copies for a few dollars the first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument like credits or insurances the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else the mentioned asset in most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset in the i give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to   and first let me point out that the definition is marginally wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets nor do they have a price like temperature sunlight or even your own life in the case of mortgages   but before going in this list let me go through the remaining points of your question what is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative as already noted in most cases a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort   in a classical insurance contract one party of the contract is an insurance company but in the broader case of a derivative that counterparty can be pretty anything an insurance a bank a government a large company and most probably market makers how is it really used and how does this deviate from the first point briefly how does is it affecting people and how is it causing problems an important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices   actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives is that they are products whose price y is a measurable function of one or several random variables on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price y of the asset this is what the depends on means in technical terms   in the most favorable case we obtain an easy formula linking y to the which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument but in practice it can be very difficult if at all possible to determine a price for derivatives this has two implications persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market in comparison to less advanced actors on the market organisation owning assets they can not price can not compute their anymore so that they can not know for sure their financial situation they are somehow playing roulette but wait if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation how is this not a contradiction some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons   for instance many in france and germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part like in a classical credit and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit   so for a 25 years running credit of type the price y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 which are the uncertain prices for the swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years   some of these can be quite small with inhabitants and needless to say do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments which in that special case led the court call the credit a and to cancel the credit   but what chain of events leads a inhabitants city in france to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the swiss frank   after the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of lehman brothers in 2008 it has begun to be very hard to organise funding which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money   so the municipality needs a 25 years credit of euros and goes to its communal bank   the communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing   so the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the swiss frank will have in the 25 next years since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit   since the small bank has no idea how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various it works with   if we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank we could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their and we could also ask if they are so that they eventually can manipulate the swiss frank to secure an even higher profit   but i will not go into this   to the best of my understanding the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot with different actors but i know this latter subject only by what i could read in french newspapers so much for the how is it causing problems part what is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives and    there meanings of course answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by hull along with deriving some important mathematical principles   and i will not copy these seven chapters here how would someone get started dealing in derivatives i 'm playing a      realistic stock market simulation so it does n't matter if your      answer to this costs me money if you ask the question i understand that you are not a professional so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play i outlined above i would not doing this   that said if you have a good mathematical background and can program well once you are with the books of hull and you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies once you are confident with this you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on and once you are done with this you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles and yes even for the simplest options they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better indeed i 've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money you know your weapons two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant   this is a classical future contract it can be modified in every imaginable way usually by options   for instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party   the price is written today as part of the contract   there is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something   unlike the future contract only one party can be obliged to do something the other a right but no obligation if you buy and option your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset this is the most familiar to anybody   credits can come in many different especially the formula to compute interests or also embed options   common options are early settlement options or options while this is not completely the credit works like an insurance   this is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money that speculates that the ratio of going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit this is like a mortgage on a financial institution   two parties agree that one will an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults here this is an explicit insurance against the event where a goes bankrupt one finds here more or less standard options on electricity but electricity have delicious as it can practically not be stored and fallout is also usually avoided as for classical options these are insurances against price moves a swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas typical example are fixed rate vs. on some given maturity which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives   the off the counter market features very very insurance products the most basic form is the insurance against drought but you can image different dangers and once you have it you can put it in options in a swap etc   for instance a restaurant with a could enter in a weather insurance paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year actually this list is virtually without limits

first the stock does represent a share of ownership and if you have a different interpretation i 'd like to see proof of that secondly when the ipo or secondary offering happened that put those shares into the market int he first place the company did receive proceeds from selling those shares while others may profit afterward it is worth noting that more than a few companies will have secondary offerings convertible debt incentive stock options and restricted stock that may be used down the road that are all dependent upon the current trading share price in terms of how useful these can be used to fund operations pay executives and so forth third if someone buys up enough shares of the company then they gain control of the company which while you are n't mentioning this case it is something to note as some individuals buy stock so that they can take over the company which happens usually this has more of an overall plan but the idea here is that getting that control of the company 's voting shares are an important piece to things here

since insurance is priced for profit the price will be more than the price of a new phone multiplied against the chance of loss and payout   otherwise insurance would not be offered since there was no money to be made by the insurance company the idea of insurance is that you are pooling your risk with everyone else   you all definitely pay a little insurance premium instead of any of you maybe paying a lot when a phone is destroyed   the question is not whether it is a good investment almost surely no but whether the loss at a random time would be too crippling to be absorbed by you when it happened   if you can afford a new phone without financial difficulty if it were destroyed then you should generally not buy insurance one other factor could be that although you are in the same risk pool as everyone else everyone pays the same rate but your situation has a higher risk than most insurance can be a better deal though the better investment over time would be to correct the risky situation instead of buying insurance   this could be that you have a habit of losing things live in an area where phones are stolen often have pets that destroy your belongings etc statistically you will come out ahead not buying insurance but you are accepting an unknown outcome

time for redditors to not understand that the reason someone is losing cash matters far more than the fact that they 're losing cash in the first place    if you have positive unit economics on every transaction and spend your margins on customer acquisition you 're losing money but gaining market share once you stop growing all of the customer acquisition spend is now pure profit this is a great reason to be losing money and raising capital from equity debt    if you have negative unit economics on every transaction and have no margins you are resorting to financing to just keep your operations running when you stop growing you 're still losing money the only way you start having a margin is by reducing cost or increasing prices uber has experimented with raising prices and it is reducing their losses but it 's also reducing their market share revenue growth but market share loss means they 're growing slower than the rest of the market not great in fact catastrophic because it means people are jumping ship because of increased prices    people keep comparing kalanick to bezos and jobs and could not be any more wrong    jobs made incredibly high margin premium products that you could n't get anywhere else if you 're putting companies on a commodity axis apple is going to be on the opposite end of uber    amazon does deliver a lot of commodity goods but they lost money for so long not just to deliver goods at negative unit economics but to also build and scale infrastructure that let them achieve positive economies of scale they built an infrastructure that rivals the logistics ops of anyone in the world they also use negative unit economics as a loss leader so for instance selling the fire and kindle at a loss because people will buy zero marginal cost items like movies music ebooks etc through them in addition to serving as a portal for amazon 's entire online store i have bought hundreds of dollars of digital goods through amazon hardware that 's pure margin for them how is a loss leader    uber shares none of these traits with amazon or apple

in my view it 's better to sell when there 's a reason to sell rather than to cap your gains at 8 i 'm assuming you have no such criteria on the other side i.e. hold your losses down to 8 that 's because what matters is how much you make overall in your portfolio not how much you make per trade example if you own three stocks equal amounts and two go up 20 but one falls 20 if you sell your gains at 8 and hold the loser you have net lost money so when do you actually sell you might say a fall of 10 from the last high is good enough to sell this is called a trailing stop which means if a stock goes from 100 to 120 i 'll still hold and sell if it to 108 needless to say if it had gone from 100 to 90 i would still be out the idea is to ride the trend for as long as you can because trends are strong and keep your trailing stops wide enough for it to absorb natural because you may get stopped out of a stock that falls 4 but eventually goes up 200 or sell under other conditions if the earnings show a distinct drop or the sector falls out of favor   whenever you decide to sell also consider what it would take for you to buy the stock back increased earnings strong prices a product release whatever because getting out might seem like a good thing but it 's just as important to not think of it as saying a stock is crappy it might just be that you had enough of one ride that does n't mean you ca n't come back for another one

going off hearsay here i believe your question is does not having a credit card lower your credit score if that is the question then in the uk at least the answer appears to be yes having a credit card makes you less of a risk because you have proven that you can handle a little bit of debt and pay it back i have a really tiny credit history never had a credit card and the only people who will lend to me are my own bank because they can actually see my income expenditure when i have my bank and at stores offering credit they have said that no credit history is n't far off a bad credit record simply having a credit card and doing the odd transactions show 's lenders you are at least semi responsible and is seen as a positive not having a credit card and not having much else for that matter makes you an unknown and an unknown is a risk in the eyes of lenders

here 's how capital gains are totaled long and short term capital gains and losses are either long term or    short term it depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property if    the taxpayer holds it for one year or less the gain or loss is    short term net capital gain   if a taxpayer ’s long term gains are more than their    long term losses the difference between the two is a net long term    capital gain if the net long term capital gain is more than the net    short term capital loss the taxpayer has a net capital gain so your net long term gains from all investments through all brokers are offset by any net short term loss   short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate i 'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain but at the same time trade the stock if you close in the next year one of two things will happen either the stock will go down and you 'll have short term gains on the short or the stock will go up and you 'll have short term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock   so i don;t see how it reduces your tax liability   at best it defers it

based on the additional comment you gave i would recommend that you keep the capital from the businesses separate as much as possible   it sounds like you wo n't get into any trouble legally if you make loans or transfers of capital from one business into the other but i would suggest that you keep detailed records of any transfers that you do make   the reason why is that in any business it is important to know the economics of how your business makes money if you find yourself making transfers repeatedly then your business model may be bad even if your transfers are only to deal with the cost of poor customers it could still mean that your business model needs to be adjusted   but if it 's a question of the timing of cash flows then there 's really nothing wrong with taking some of the money from your successful pants operation and building up more working capital in your shop

this is similar to the overnight lending rate set by the us federal reserve board if money is more expensive to borrow higher interest rate then less will be borrowed   commercial and consumer loan rates follow up or down via market pressures though possibly to a lesser extent in china to adjust to the new central bank rate money creation is driven in part by fractional reserve banking banks are required to have but a small percentage of deposits on hand in cash and the rest can be lent out deposited in another bank that has the same fractional reserve requirement and that money can be lent out etc   higher interest rates dampen this lending activity so inflation is down

the crucial question not addressed by other answers is your ability to repay the debt    borrowing is always about leverage and leverage is always about risk   in the home improvement loan case default comes with dire to extinguish the debt you might have to sell your home with a stable job reliable income and sufficient cash flow and of course comfort that the project will yield benefits you 're happy to pay for then the clear answer is go ahead and borrow but if you work in a highly cyclical industry have very little cash saved or for whatever other reason are uncertain about your future ability to pay then do n't borrow   save until you are more comfortable you can handle the loan   that does n't necessarily mean save all the money just save enough that you are highly confident in your ability to pay whatever you borrow

as someone who 's done quit a bit of home improvement and seen positive roi i can speak from some personal experience   all of this assumes you do the unskilled labor yourself and shop around for relatively cheap plumbers electricians etc first never underestimate the resale value added by a can of paint   this assumes you have or know someone with a good sense of style that can help improve the aesthetics of the home significantly   white walls can be so boring to homebuyers and so many of them ca n't see through the of an inch of white paint second look for shortcomings in the house as is anyway these are some common upgrades   the big thing is to find something you are reasonably comfortable doing yourself and that you will enjoy   realize that if you 're new to this most projects will cost twice what you budget and take four times as long   the pride of having done it yourself and put in the sweat equity makes it worth it though usually edit to better answer your modified question i 'm adding to my answer   so if i understand it your question is now at what rate is it sane to invest in our house vs. outside investments   this is really just a matter of balancing risk vs. lifestyle   with most upgrades there is no financial benefit to investing in upgrading your home now vs. 5 years from now right before you sell   you could be making 10 in mutual funds until then and then invest in the upgrades right before you sell   there is obviously a physical limit to how fast you can do these improvements yourself but front loading this now at the beginning of your timeframe as opposed to the end is not an investment decision it is a lifestyle decision   not saying do n't do it but do n't rationalize it to yourself as we 're saving money by doing this now   maybe use the rationalization we want to enjoy these upgrades and not just add them before we move out one exception to that i 'd plant any trees now and make sure they have a good water supply   good trees take a while to grow and doing that sooner rather than later will help

this particular topic has probably been beaten to death already   but from the other comments it seems that splitting finances them is a popular solution on this forum   i can see the individual benefit of this makes it easy to go buy whatever you want   but it can hurt too   what if the situation changes and you are no longer employed   your setup will cause stress because now you are having to ask your spouse to pay for everything   if this works for you congratulations   but fights may ensue divorce may follow i would like to offer an alternative   in my situation i bring home a paycheck while my wife does not   in this case each of us paying 50 would simply not work   not to say my wife does n't work she works her butt off cleaning house raising kids etc what we do is have any money that comes in go into a pot   we budget oh no the b word out regular expenses lights gas rent   anything that is n't allocated goes towards retirement savings in the us an ira is an individual retirement account or towards a war chest for big project such as home ownership   and each of us gets the same blow money allowance every week that we can do with as we please keep in mind using this mentality allows the possibility of me staying home at some point in the future when my wife goes back to her dream job   and there is no financial stress about whom owns what or who paid for what   we own it because we decided to pay for it

not to mention that many oil fields do n't make a profit below $   the saudis over produced on purpose based on that premise betting that they could drive much of the growing north american production out of business by keeping the price below the point where tar sands and hydraulic fracking could be profitable   if oil dropped to $ few countries would bother pumping it   while saudi arabia and some of the uae could make a profit at that point for now even iraq would be losing money     that reduced production would drive the price right back up since oil is still used in plastics shipping road construction etc   even if every car being sold becomes electric overnight and all the electric power plants become wind nuclear or solar based tomorrow we 'd still have a decade or more of existing ice cars on the road   it 's not the world would stop using oil in the next 6 8 years just because investment pours into electric cars   if anything a drop to $ would slow the move away from oil significantly what incentive would people have to buy a more expensive electric car when gas at the pump is suddenly is $ 1 again

in the us pension benefits promised by employers are tightly regulated by a law called erisa one of the requirements is that money be deposited in a trust that is out of the reach of the employer and the employer 's creditors so even if the employer falls on hard times or goes bankrupt the money to pay the pensions is still there in addition the benefits are guaranteed by the federal government through the pension benefit guaranty corporation usually called the pbgc relative to most investments pensions are a safe bet

hi i 'm not sure what you 're looking for but i 'll assume you are just looking for some distinguishing characteristics of an infra deal   infra deals are typically   project financed meaning that a special purpose company spc is established to build and operate the asset project finance means that the spc is from any party and is backed by the cashflows of the project and not by the balance sheet of some parent entity   the spc 's cashflows are backed by a lengthy concession agreement e.g. a government body provides a concession to a private party to operate the infrastructure asset for say 30 years the concession agreement can best be thought of as a form of guarantee provided by the government body the exact terms of the agreement will vary but something like you can operate this toll road for 30 years and charge $ x per vehicle indexed at y% p.a should give you the idea of what a concession agreement is    because the concession agreement acts a bit like a guarantee over the cashflows of the spc it makes longer term and higher leveraged financing more plausible imagine a national asset where the aaa credit rated government body guaranteed 20 m cars a year for 30 years with a $ 5 toll charge your spc now has $ 100 m of cashflow every year for 30 years which is aaa credit rated this should enable you to get competitively priced long term capital and to gear the spc at much higher rates than non infra deals   at the end of the concession period the spc hands the asset back to the government completely debt free   so in a nutshell a government body grants a concession to a spc that guarantees its cashflows over a long term the spc is then financed based purely on this guarantee the spc then builds the asset operates it and then at the end of the concession period transfers it back to the government google build operate transfer or bot for more detail if curious     there are plenty of other distinguishing characteristics and a truck load of detail that i have completely skipped ignored so others may want to jump in ridicule me   good luck with your interview   edit formatting

there are a couple of reasons to diversify your assets first since we can not predict which of our investments will perform best we want to cast our net broadly enough to have something invested in what 's going to be performing well second diversification is n't intended to provide the highest returns but rather it is used to soften the effects of market volatility by the downsides and lowering the overall volatility among our assets returns are more consistent   if a model does not address future downside risk it is only telling you part of the story past performance does not guarantee you get the picture

the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage based on your question it would be foolish for you to sign anyone who describes a mortgage as something obviously has no idea what they are doing and should never sign a mortgage which is a promise to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars you would be doubly foolish to sign the mortgage because if you are guaranteeing the loan you own nothing so for example if your friend sold the house pocketed the money then left the country you would owe the full amount of the mortgage since you are not on the deed there is no way you can prevent this from happening he does not need your approval to sell the house so essentially what your friend is doing is asking you to assume all the risk of the mortgage with none of the benefits since he gets the house not you if a girlfriend is involved that just increases the risk you will have a problem also although it is not clear it appears this is a second house for him if so that him from any mortgage assistance or relief so the risk is even higher basically it would foolish in the extreme to co sign the loan

you are presuming that after the transfer the cash is still sitting in a western union register but no that cash may have already been taken by the fraudster to refund the victim western union would have to 1 pay the victim back the amount of money lost and then 2 pursue the fraudster to reclaim the lost funds because the fraudster at the other end can simply show id to get the money ie they do not have an account with western union the cost to pursue that person to reclaim the lost funds would be substantially higher than for your bank because your bank can simply ding your account in the event that your account goes into overdraft because there were insufficient funds to reclaim the full amount the bank at least has a framework in place to pursue you for penalties

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

the typical deal is you can put 10 of your gross pay into the espp the purchase will occur on the last deposit date usually a 6 month period at a 15 discount to the market price   so the math is something like this your return if sold the day it 's purchased is not 15 it 's 100/85 or 17.6 minor on my part i suppose   also the return is not a 6 month return as the weekly or bi weekly deductions are the average between the oldest 6 mo and the most recent uh zero time maybe a week this is closer to 3 months the annualized rate is actually pretty meaningless since you do n't have 4 opportunities to achieve this return it 's important only if the cash flow hit causes you to borrow to support the espp purchases the risk is whether the stock drops the 15 before you can execute the sell to take advantage of the gain   of course the return is gross you need to net for taxes   edit to respond to comment below when i said meaningless i meant that you ca n't take the 17.6 annualize it to per year and think your $ 1000 will compound to $ it 's as meaningless as when an investor gets a 10 gain on a stock in one day and with 250 trading days per year decides his $ 1000 will be worth $ 2 quadrillion dollars after a year the 17.6 is significant in that it 's available twice per year for a true 38 return over a year but if borrowing to help the cash flow that rate is really over 3 months

it 's not quite as bad as the comments indicate form 1040es has been available since january and has been similarly for all past years it mostly uses the prior year currently 2016 as the basis but it does have the updated 2017 figures for items that are automatically adjusted for inflation bracket points and thus filing standard deductions social security cap and maybe another one or two i missed   the forms making up the actual return can not be prepared very far in advance because as commented congress frequently makes changes to tax law well after the year begins and in some cases right up to dec. 31 the irs must start preparing forms and pubs and equally important setting the specifications for software providers like intuit turbotax and several months ahead in order to not seriously delay filing season and with it refunds which nearly everyone in the country considers at least publicly to be worse than world war three and the destruction of the earth by rogue i have 1040 series from the last 4 years still on my computer and the download dates mostly range from late september to mid january although one outlier shows the range of possibility 2013 form 1040 and schedule a were in april 2014 because congress passed a law allowing charitable contributions for to be deducted in the prior year substantive but relatively minor changes happen every year including many that keep recurring like the special pre agi teacher supplies deduction will they or wo n't they section 179 expensing changes slightly almost every year and formerly the ira direct to charity option finally made permanent last year   as commented the current congress and president were elected on a platform with tax reform as an important element and they are talking even more intensely than before about doing it although whether they will actually do anything this year is still uncertain however if major reform is done it will almost certainly apply to future years only and likely only start after a lag of some months to a year they know it causes chaos for businesses and households alike to without advance warning the assumptions built in to current budgets and plans and as a political matter something that is enacted now and effective fairly soon but not now is just as good but i think that part is

tax refund the us generally does not refund tax like other countries for larger sales you might want to try state tax refunds check here us customs you never pay us customs when you leave they do n't care about what you take out of the country you might have to pay customs in your arrival country afterwards and the rules depend on the country you arrive in most countries have a limit on how much you can bring for free typically in the range of 500 $ but that varies a lot also some countries do not count used articles so if you wear your new clothing once it does not count against the limit anymore

as more actively managed funds are driven out of the market the pricing of individual stocks should become less rational i.e. more stocks will become underpriced relative to their peers as stock prices become less rational the reward for active investing will increase since it will become easier to pick a winner eventually the market will reach a new equilibrium where only active investors who are good enough to turn a profit will remain even then passive investment will still do roughly as well as the market since it has low overhead and minimal investment lag there is no reason to expect the system to collapse since it is characterized primarily by negative feedback loops rather than positive feedback   the last few decades have seen a shift from active to passive investment because increased market transparency and efficiency have reduced the labor required to keep pricing rational basically as people have gotten better at predicting stock performance less active investment has been required to keep prices rational

checking accounts ca n't pay interest according to the bizarre and outdated regulation q. under the even more bizarre and outdated regulation d you can only transfer money out of savings accounts six times per 4 weeks your hsa account is probably set up the way it is because the bank wants to be able to tell people they 'll earn interest on their savings although i 'll the current rate is something like as far as i know there 's no reason an hsa could n't be a straight checking account you would n't get interest but you would get more than 6 withdrawals per month or you could do the transfers yourself from savings to checking just keep enough money in the checking part of the account so that the automatic transfer does n't kick in

the original option writer seller can close his short position in the contracts he wrote by purchasing back matching contracts i.e. contracts with the same terms underlying option type strike price expiration date from any others who hold long positions or else who write new matching contract instances rather than buyer and seller settling directly options are settled through a central options clearing house being the options clearing corporation for exchange listed options in the u.s. see also wikipedia clearing house finance so the original buyer of the put maintains his position insurance and the clearing process ensures he is matched up with somebody else holding a matching obligation if he chooses to exercise his put i also answered a similar question but in more detail here

of course best is a subjective term however relying on the resources of the larger institutions by pooling with them will definitely reduce your own burden with regards to the research and keeping track so yes investing in mutual funds and etfs is a very sound strategy it would be better to diversify and not to invest all your money in one fund or in one industry area that said there are more than enough individuals who do their own research and stock picking and invest with various degrees of success in individual securities some also more advanced strategies such as leveraging options futures margins etc these advance strategies come at a greater risk but may bring a greater rewards as well so the answer to the question in the subject line is yes for all the rest there 's no one right or wrong answer it depends greatly on your abilities time risk tolerance cash available to invest etc etc

you need to understand how various entities make their money once you know that you can determine whether their interests are aligned with yours for example a full service broker makes money when you buy and sell stocks they therefore have in interest in you doing lots of buying and selling not in making you money or no fee financial advisors make their money through commissions on what they sell you which means their interests are served by selling you those investments with high commissions not the investments that would serve you best financial media makes their money through attracting viewers readers and selling advertising that is their business and they are not in the business of giving good advice there are lots of good investments index funds are a great example that do n't get much attention because there is n't any money in them   in fact the majority of wall street is not aligned with your interests so be skeptical of the financial industry in general   there are for fee financial advisors who you pay directly their interests are fairly well aligned with yours there is a fair amount of good information at the motley fool

think about it this way if the strike price is $ 200 and cost of the option is $ 0.05 $ 200 + $ 0.05 is $ that does not mean that the price of buying the option is more neither is the option writer going to pay you $ 70 to buy the contract   when you are buying options you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it   in case of the $ 115 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $   in case of the $ 130 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $ this is due to the fact that the chances of aapl going to hit $ 130 is less than the chance of aapl hitting $ 115 therefore option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price   long story short you do not pay for the strike price you only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in strike decrease if it is a put option strike price is just a number that you expect the stock or index to break i would suggest you to read up a little more on pricing from here

my theory is that for every stock you buy you should have an exit strategy and follow it   it is too hard to let emotions rule if you let your default strategy be let 's see what happens and emotional investing will almost never serve you well   so before buying a stock set a maximum loss and maximum gain that you will watch for on the stock and when it hits that number sell   at the very least when it hits one of your numbers consciously make a decision that you are effectively buying it again at the current price if you decide to stay in when you do this set a new high and low price and repeat the above strategy

i believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it and how that impacts each of our personal finances i will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question so please bear with me if you disagree on any point some of these tax savings are well advertised and can be used by many people such as tax credits for mass transit passes which exists in some countries but some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before until it winds up on the news why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and i can not get and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us a simplistic answer can show this in three parts 1 the source of one 's income 2 transaction costs and 3 tax loopholes tax savings occur proportionately to one 's income and if the savings apply to investment income they occur proportionately to one 's wealth if someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account saves tax on investment income they might reduce their taxable interest from $ 50 to $ 0 that 's because they simply do n't have any other investment income to reduce all of their income comes in the form of employment which is typically very hard to save taxes on most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income because it is a huge proportion of income in the country and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated and because it is very straightforward work for someone = employment income a more cynical person than i might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable the simplest example would be if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person ca n't understand it themselves then an accountant lawyer or banker will need to be the one to explain it and that can cost you money if your tax is n't so much to begin with then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves for example most countries have tax savings deferrals if you start a corporation these rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy but someone who earns $ 10k in a side business might not be able to afford the $ 3k in incorporation costs just to save $ 2k in taxes the more income and wealth you have the more these transaction costs become worthwhile i 'm going to generally define tax loopholes for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected this often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity but ends up allowing another group to take advantage   for example in canada there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates only when a close family member is near death setting up a testamentary trust between a grandparent and a could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional tax brackets meaning more income would be taxed at a less than top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren   the rules were put in place with the idea that oh gee a family member has died and the ol' family is so hard they ca n't distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying we should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person and if they earn only a little income they have a low tax rate and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income seems reasonable enough but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is the bucket with their foot a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances   in the case of the panama paradise leaks tax savings are due to all 3 of the above those who have massive wealth and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific tax loopholes the simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically this is often a result of cracks in the foreign tax treaties between countries which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent double taxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason take for example the apple loophole apple has operations around the world some activity occurs in low tax jurisdictions apple reports a high percentage of the value of r&d as being associated with those jurisdictions those branches in low tax jurisdictions charge the high tax branches such as the us with fees for use of their valuable research so much of apple 's income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions it wo n't be taxed in the us until apple the cash back to the us until then the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction accruing less tax this and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates how each particular rule loophole works will depend on the nature of a specific case tax law is complex and the rules between countries are even more so these foreign tax loopholes are closing every year it is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth these types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes

i 'm assuming you directed that question to me i do n't disagree with your question regarding a game   but potentially causing financial ruin is not a game   if everyone abused these laws our economy would come to a stand still due to a total crisis of confidence   using trump as an example   the baja condo wiki   trump gets paid $ 500k up front to license his name nothing wrong with that   he also gets a percentage of future revenue nothing wrong with that   he tells buyers he is involved at every capacity   this is a lie   people feel and put down deposits of $   $ 22 million in deposits are la fi trump lawsuit and the project fades away   all the investors people get nothing   trump made his $ 500k possibly a lot no responsibility and moves on   if everyone did this our markets would freeze up

so is it weird that i write my check to the name of the company on the power plant   i can not for the life of me see any of the middle men in my distribution channel   where i am you usually get power right from the big energy company in my case or if you live out of town you can opt for the co op that buys from   the co op is in theory the better deal because they can negotiate larger volume pricing and all profit from the co op goes to its members but there are n't very many steps either way   edit after a bit of digging my power provider is also a buyer but most definitely the owner of a large nuclear plant near me

i was in a similar but not quite as bad situation a couple years ago and i had a stroke of luck that helped me but your friend might be able to force a similar situation my parents refused to take out the huge parent loan understandably so but my dad made enough money that i was n't eligible for much aid   my stroke of luck came when they got divorced i could my fafsa with only one parent using my mom with very little income my aid shot through the roof and nearly covered my undergrad this happened in california i do n't know if this works in other states my advice for your friend would be to take the 6 units part time job option but do what she can to earn enough to pay her own rent food other bills   i think the requirement for filing as an independent is that you supply > 50 of your own income   it wo n't kick in right away but for next school year this would end up getting her a lot more money from the state federal governments   for me it was enough to cover my school food rent gas car payment and still have a little left over i do n't know if this is still possible and i know it does n't work for graduate school or if it applies to every state   it might be an option worth pursuing though

the interest rate will probably be better for your primary residency however the risk is higher too in the event you ca n't pay it off you probably would rather lose the second home and not the primary home re the tax benefit it will be attached to the rental you 're buying since that 's what the loan is for however if you have a heloc on your primary residency you can deduct interest on up to $ 100 k on your schedule a regardless of what you 're doing with the money this can be useful if the rental is losing money and you do n't want to accumulate the interest deduction as passive loss

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

look for offers for 0 or low apr on balance transfers it is more likely to get a promotional apr on balance transfer than to lower the apr you already have of course try to pay off the balance as long as you 're in the period of the promotion because otherwise you 'll end up paying the high rate again if you can not get such an offer low credit etc then just try to pay off asap and start rebuilding your credit not much there btw when you consider the balance transfer promotions look at 3 things the promotion period when it ends so that you 'd know how much time you have to pay it off the balance transfer fee usually the balance transfer itself is not free and you pay 3 5 on the transfer if you have 0 apr for 12 months it makes it effectively 5 apr for the 5 fee if the period is lesser the apr is higher take that into the account the apr after the promotion in case you ca n't pay off in that time frame

yes there is a lot they are leaving out and i would be extremely skeptical of them because of the reasons they give for being able to charge $ 0 commissions their reasons are that they do n't have physical locations and high overhead costs the reality is that they are burning venture capital on exchange fees until they actually start charging everyone they suckered into opening accounts they also get paid by exchanges when users provide liquidity these are called trade rebates in the maker taker model they will start offering margin accounts and charging interest they are likely selling trade data to high frequency trading firms that then fill your stock trades at worse prices robinhood users are notorious for complaining about the fills they may well be able to keep commissions low as that has been a race to the bottom for a long time but if they were doing their users any actual favors then they would be also paying users the rebates that exchanges pay them for liquidity robinhood is n't doing anything unique as all brokers do what i mentioned along with charging commissions and it is actually amazing their sales pitch $ 0 commissions because we are just a mobile app lol was enough for their customers they are just being disingenuous

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

i do n't know of any that are comparable to credit cards there 's a reason for that debit cards being newer have a much lower interchange rate since collecting on debt is risky and less predictable rewards miles are paid from those interchange fees this means with a debit card there 's less money to pay you with so what can you do assuming your credit is n't terrible you can just open a credit card account and pay in full for purchases by the grace period i do n't know how all cards work but my grace period allows me to pay in full by the billing date roughly a month from purchase and incur no finance charges in effect i get a small 30 day loan with no interest and a cash back incentive i dislike miles you 're also less liable for fraud via cc than debit

speculation is when someone else makes an investment you do n't like the above is tongue in cheek but is a serious answer there are several attempts at separating the two but they turn into moral judgements on the value of a pure buy and hold versus any other investment strategy which is itself doubtful is shorting an oil stock more speculation than buying and holding an alternative energy stock some economists take the other route and just argue that we should remove the moral judgement and celebrate speculation as we celebrate investment

$ 10k is n't really enough to make enough money to offset the extremely high risks in investing in options in this area taking risks is great but a sure losing proposition is n't a risk it 's a gamble you 're likely to get wiped out with leveraged options since you do n't have enough money to hedge your bets timing is critical look at the swings in valuation in the stock market between the bear and lehman collapses in 2009 if you were highly leveraged in that you bought in june 2009 you would have $ 0 in november with $ 10k i 'd diversify into a mixture of foreign cash maybe etfs like emerging markets equities and commodities your goal should be to preserve investment value until buying opportunities for depressed assets come around   higher interest rates that come with inflation will be devastating to the us economy so if i 'm betting on high inflation i want to wait for a buying opportunity then you buy depressed non cyclical equities with easy to predict cash flows like utilities coned food manufacturers general mills consumer non and alcohol tobacco if they look solvent buying commodity etfs like the new copper etfs or interests in physical commodities like copper timber oil or other raw materials with intrinsic value are good too   i personally do n't like gold for this purpose because it does n't have alot of industrial utility silver is a little better but copper and oil are things with high intrinsic value that are always needed as far as leverage goes proceed with caution what happens when you get high inflation high cost of capital

think of yourself as a business with two accounts cash and net worth your goal is to make money cash is what you need to meet your obligations you need to pay your rent mortgage utilities buy food pay for transportation service debt etc if you make $ 100 a month and your obligations are $ 90 you 're clearing $ 10 net worth are assets that you own including cash retirement savings investments or even tangible goods like real property or items you collect with value the pay off debt versus save money debate in my opinion is driven by two things in this order if you start saving too soon you 'll have a hard time getting by when your car suddenly needs a $ 500 repair or you need a new furnace you need to improve your cash flow so that you actually have discretionary income pay off those credit cards then start directing those old payments into savings and investments

for the record i am the original question asker and i 'm reporting back to say that the approach described in the accepted answer did not work i am adding a new answer rather than commenting on the accepted answer because of the length of explanation required i applied for an itin by filing a w-7 with all appropriate documentation including a birth certificate death certificate and recognition of birth abroad i.e. proof of u.s. citizenship the irs rejected the application saying that people who are eligible for ca n't have that placed me in an untenable situation because even though the irs said she was eligible for an ssn the social security administration said they never issue to dead people as a matter of policy   so insult was added to injury it is true that i should have applied for an ssn while she was alive in which case it would have been a simple matter i just paid the extra tax that was due because of her not counting as a dependent during the years for which i was filing the amount was not worth fighting over further or renouncing my u.s. citizenship   moral of story live in all ways as if there is no guarantee your children will be alive tomorrow because there is no such guarantee

this is not a problem swift does not need the beneficiary account currency the settlement account or the instruction amount is of interest to the banks as i understand your agreement with client is they pay you x eur that is what would be specified on the swift along with your details as beneficiary account number etc once the funds are received by your bank in turkey they will get eur when they apply these funds to your account in usd they will convert using the standard rates unless you are a large customer and have special instructions like do not credit if funds are received in non usd or give me a special rate or call me and ask me what i want to do etc it typically takes 3 5 days for an international wire depending on the countries and currencies involved wait for few more days and then if not received you have to ask your client to mention to his bank that beneficiary is claiming non receipt of funds the bank that initiated the transfer can track the wire not the your bank which is supposed to receive the funds

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

yes you ca n't simply withdraw your super until you are aged 60 and that may go up slightly on budget night but you can roll it over into a smsf where you decide where you invest your super funds however i would advise against you starting a smsf at this early age with a very small super fund account the admin and audit fees would eat your super account up in one year it is recommended that you have at least $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 in super fund assets before starting a smsf to make the fees competitive and efficient now if you are with a partner and start a smsf together then it is your combined funds that need to be over the $ 300 k mark a smsf can have between 1 to 4 members the cheapest fund i could find was first state super the fees are $ 52 + per year for the high growth option so for a balance of $ 1000 you would pay $ or per year the high growth investment option has returned over the last year pa over the last 5 years and pa over the last 10 years which includes the period covering the gfc so even with a small balance of $ 1000 your super investment will still continue to grow if you could slowly grow your super account to $ 2000 your fees would be $ or and at $ 3000 balance your fees would be $ or the great thing about super is the tax advantages you may be complaining now about fees on a small balance and yes you should try to minimise these fees not only when you have a small balance but also when your balance is larger but the tax advantages available through superannuation will really come into play when you are on a high income paying the tax at or near the highest marginal tax rate compare the top marginal tax rate plus medicare levy at compared to the tax rate of 15 on super contributions and investment returns and it gets better when you retire and take a pension or lump sum from your super after age 60 you pay zero tax on the income stream or lump sum and you also pay zero tax on any ongoing investment returns in your super the benefits of superannuation are numerous and the best way to reduce your fees for now is to find a fund with lowest fees try to increase your balance so your percentage fees go down and try to consolidate all your super funds into the one with the lowest fees if you have more than one super fund

are there any other losses that can be expected beyond the above the lender may have to invest some money into the house in order to get it in shape to sell also while the lender possesses the house they are liable to the property taxes and possibly utilities are there any statutes or pressures to motivate the financial institution to get fair price when the property is sold the lender is motivated to at least break even when selling the property in order to limit losses on their investment this means they are very motivated to seek a higher price but they 're also motivated to sell the property quickly in order to limit their losses due to property taxes usually the lender takes a loss of the investment if foreclosure occurs only 10 percent to 20 percent   of auctioned foreclosed houses did yield a surplus when the lender sells the foreclosed property using a realtor they 're motivated to sell it as quickly as possible so long as they break even in this case there is little motivation to sell the property for a surplus if the property is being sold via auction then time is not a factor and the lender will just sell to the highest bidder

gt;you could say the same about any public utility except the one largest one technically   there are literally thousands and thousands of processors which is not the case with utilities additionally processors do n't need to have any kind of office or presence anywhere near the business they 're serving which means being able to choose without geographical restrictions also paypal is not a utility this is not a relevant comparison   gt;are you saying they are unable both contractually and technically to affect the consumer side   they 'd have to revoke their partnerships with banks who issue cards which they are n't going to do because consumers using cards is how they make money banks could choose not to issue cards but they 're already free to do that there 's no right to a credit card   gt;but also by selectively quoting me you are deliberately side stepping what actually happened in the wikileaks case to focus on the consumer side   visa and mastercard prohibited payments to wikileaks on the basis of allegedly facilitating illegal activity how is that relevant to what paypal 's doing    gt;you must buy things in different corners of the internet than i do the customer experience to me is that there is the store or you can pay with paypal yes the store is actually a payment processor but this is a quick slippery slope to what you can just set up your own payment processor once they 've all blocked your legal business   what are you talking about you acknowledge that the store has its own processing but somehow that 's not enough because someday they might not have processing and have to go through paypal   processors already deny service to legal businesses notably anything considered high risk which includes travel services pharmaceuticals firearms adult entertainment telemarketing debt collection tobacco and more but also for businesses with poor credit high chargebacks business practices they do n't agree with lots of international transactions etc    it literally happens all the time and there are so many processors tens of thousands that there 's another processor willing to step in    tons of websites do n't even use paypal anymore and the ones that do often layer it on top of a different payment option paypal is trying hard to increase their presence in stores because of the competition in the internet space no one is unable to accept payments if they 're barred from paypal paypal actually cuts off accounts all the time because people use it for things against paypal 's tos    amazon payments shopify and stripe are the ones that most people know off the tops of their heads for online processing but there are literally thousands no one is somehow unable to conduct business if they ca n't use paypal    the only time that businesses ca n't really get processing is if they do something like rack up chargebacks and disappear or commit fraud against a processor in those cases the processor can put that business on the terminated merchant file or match list and other processors will see that there 's been a problem with that customer and not take them on even in those cases businesses can rectify the issue and get off the match list or they can look for processors that will serve them anyway and expect to pay a premium for it

usually when a stock is up trending or down trending the price does not go up or down in a straight line in an uptrend the price may go up over a couple of days then it could go down the next day or two but the general direction would be up over the medium term the opposite for a downtrend so if the stock has been generally going up over the last few weeks it may take a for a week or two before prices continue up again this is called a retracement in the uptrend the fibonacci levels are possible amounts by which the price might retract before it continues on its way up again by the way 50 is not actually a fibonacci retracement level but it is a common retracement level which is usually used in combination with the fibonacci retracement levels

there are a number of scholarly articles on the subject including a number at the end of the vanguard article you reference   however unfortunately like much of financial research you ca n't look at the articles without paying quite a bit it is not easy to make a generic comparison between lump sum and dollar cost averaging because there are many ways to do dollar cost averaging   how long do you average over   do you evenly average or exponentially put the money to work   the easiest way to think about this problem though is does the extra compounding from investing more of the money immediately outweigh the chance that you may have invested all the money when the market is overvalued   since the market is usually near the correct value investing in lump sum will usually win out as the vanguard article suggests as a side note while using dca on a large one time sum of money is generally not optimal if you have a consistent salary dca by frequently investing a portion of your salary has been frequently shown to be a very good idea of long periods over saving up a bunch of money and investing it all at once   in this case you get the compounding advantage of investing early and you avoid investing a large chunk of money when the market is overvalued

congratulations on recognizing your problem and getting serious about paying down your debt that 's the first step if you have a loan with 80 interest yes get that paid off as quickly as possible much better to be paying even the outrageous 20 on a credit card than the astounding 80 as others have noted if you can get a consolidation loan or refinance that 80 to something more realistic do it and do it as soon as possible heck if you have the credit limit use the credit card to off the 80 loan 20 on a credit card is better than 80 of course you may not have enough credit limit to do that cash back rewards are nice if you are paying off the credit card balance each month but in your case you 're not 25 with a 2 cash back reward means you 're still paying 23 the first month and 25 every month after that that 's worse than 20 remember you pay the interest on your balance every month that you do n't pay it off while a cash back is a one time thing so if you 're not going to pay off the balance at best a cash back reward could be effectively subtracted from the interest rate 20 with a 2 cashback is effectively somewhere between 18 and 20 if you 're comparing 20 with 2 cashback to 19 could be complicated to figure out which is better but it 's clearly worse than anything more than 20 besides that you do n't say what your total debt is in relation to your income if you have a lot of debt i 'd say first thing is to figure out what you can do to cut your expenses lots of things that people call fixed expenses are n't really fixed at all they just take some effort to cut like if you have a big expensive house and you 're paying a large mortgage you can probably cut that by selling the place and moving to a cheaper house i say probably because the housing market may make it impossible to sell for enough to improve your situation if you have large heating bills you can turn the thermostat down and get used to wearing a around the house etc   final note i 've talked to a fair number of people with debt problems and i often hear them say yes i really need to cut my spending and start paying off these debts and i intend to right after i buy this one last thing that i really really want but of course after that there 's one more vital purchase and then another etc avoid falling into this trap

wireless capabilities see tesla every type of communication outside of the really was created without the government so the fact that i was born here against my own free will automatically gives the government the right to seize the fruits of my labor this is where this bullshit statist logic falls apart because the only rebuttal you have is well just leave then which is fucking stupid and in pretty sure i already gave you 1 way but i 'll say it again cuz it 's clear you 're incapable of following along federal sales tax with federal sales tax there are no deductions or coercion also the more money individuals have in their pocket   disposable income the more likely they are to spend and grow the economy that 's why you see countries like sweden with insane tax rates seeing limited growth and in a lot of cases on the verge of an economic collapse so if people have more disposable income causing them to have more purchasing power a federal sales tax would probably do better than an income tax and the people would receive something tangible instead of just losing 25 of their pay check btw do n't ever say my income tax pays for roads because they do n't that 's what a gas tax is for a majority of our infrastructure is paid for with revenue from other taxes not income income taxes pay mostly into military budget and social programs ie social security

after the initial public offering the company can raise money by selling more stock equity financing or selling debt e.g. borrowing money   if a company 's stock price is high they can raise money with equity financing on more favorable terms   when companies raise money with equity financing they create new shares and dilute the existing shareholders so the number of shares outstanding is not fixed companies can also return money to shareholders by buying their own equity and this is called a share repurchase   it 's best for companies to repurchase their shared when their stock price is low but american companies have a terrible track record of buying their own shares high and selling them low the management of a company typically likes a rising stock price so their stock options are more valuable and they can justify bigger pay packages

investors are typically a part of the board of directors of the company because of their ownership in the company they have a vested interest in its stock price the same is true for management also in cases where they hold a certain percentage of equity in the company their incentives also get aligned to the stock price

edited pub 550 says 30 days before or after so the example is ok but still a gain by average share basis   on sale your basis is likely defaulted to average price in the example so there was a gain selling at 10 but can be named shares at your election to your brokerage   and supported by record keeping a pub 550 wash might be buy 2000 10 with basis 20000 sell 1000 nominally a loss of 1000 for now and remaining basis 10000 buy 1000 8 within 30 days    because of the wash sale rule the basis is 10000 + 8000 paid + 1000 disallowed loss from wash sale with a final position of 2000 shares at basis   i think i have the link at the example

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

although social security amp medicare have been known to be some of the most efficient government run programs their future is dismal with increase in life expectancy and rising unemployment and extensions on unemployment insurance something has to give because of the severe recession medicare is now paying out more than it receives    some of the programs i think the federal government spends too much money on include agricultural style tax expenditures selective tax breaks and land based cold war military systems
