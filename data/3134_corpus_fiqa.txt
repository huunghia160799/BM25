no matter how a company releases relevant information about their business somebody will be the first to see it i mean of all the people looking someone has to be the first i presume that professional stock brokers have their eyes on these things closely and know exactly who publishes where and when to expect new information in real life many brokers are going to be seeing this information within seconds of each other i suppose if one sees it half a second before everybody else knows what he 's looking for and has already decided what he 's going to do based on this information he might get a buy or sell order in before anybody else odds are that if you 're not a professional broker you do n't know when to expect new information to be posted and you probably have a job or a family or like to eat and sleep now and then so you ca n't be watching somebody 's web site constantly so you 'll be lagging hours or days behind the full time professionals

yes there are very lucrative opportunities available by using financial news releases a lot of times other people just are n't looking in less popular markets or you may observe the news source before other people realize it or may interpret the news differently than the other market participants there is also the buy the rumor sell the news mantra for positive expected information opposite for negative expected news which results in a counterintuitive trading pattern

in the u.s. publicly traded companies are under the rules of regulation fair disclosure which says that a company must release information to all investors at the same time   the company website and social media both count as fair disclosure because every investor has access to those outlets but a press release service could also be the first outlet   what is forbidden by this regulation is the practice of releasing news first to the brokers who could inform certain customers of the news early i think that the first outlet for press releases could be different for each company depending on the internal procedures of the company   some would update their website first and others would wait to update the site until the press release hits the first

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

according to this study put out this year by and porter the face value of counterfeit currency relative to the total amount in circulation is about 0.01 we conclude that the total value of counterfeits in circulation at any moment is on the order of $ 60 to $ 80 million or less than $ 1 for every $ 10,000 outstanding and is highly unlikely to exceed $ 220 million or less than $ 3 for every $ 10,000 in circulation further we conclude that the incidence of counterfeits is roughly the same inside and outside the united states actual numbers from five years ago suggest about the same out of the approximately $ billion in u.s. dollars held in u.s. currency in the form of banknotes paper currency in circulation outside the u.s. treasury and the federal reserve at the end of 2005 the secret service reported that about $ 61 million in counterfeit currency was passed on the public worldwide of the counterfeit currency passed the majority $ million was passed in the united states with the remainder passed abroad as to why they 're checking   would you want to receive a counterfeit bill costco checks my cash when i check out   the guy i got a buggy ride from up in upstate new york checked my bill   it 's easy to check certain things on the bill   why not

there are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind if you are a cash basis taxpayer most individuals are then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet   if you operate on an accrual basis then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client you can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates and if these together with any income tax withholding from wage paying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year if your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds the income can   vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in december then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax this is called the method a part of form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it   your annualized income for the payment due on june 15 is 2.4 = times your taxable income through may 31 thus on form 2210 you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income   through may 31 will continue for the rest of the year you then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by june 15 similarly for september 15 for which you look at income through august 31 you use a multiplier of 1.5 = and need to pay of the tax on the annualized income and so on   if you these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment then you owe penalties for that quarter   most people find that the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method even simpler is to pay 100 of last year 's tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all if your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year then this of last year 's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till april 15

you need to have 3 things if you are considering short term trading which i absolutely do not recommend the ability to completely disconnect your emotions from your gains and losses yes even your gains but especially your losses the winning losing on a daily basis will cause you to start taking unnecessary risk in order to win again if you ca n't disconnect your emotions then this is n't the game for you   the lowest possible trading costs to enter and exit a position people will talk about 1 trading costs that rule of thumb does n't apply anymore personally my trading costs are a total basis points to enter and exit a $ 10,000 position and i think it 's still too high that 's just a hair above one of 1 for you non traders   the ability to gut check and exit a losing position fast do n't hesitate and do n't hope for it to go up gtfo if you are serious about short term trading then you must close all positions on a daily basis   do n't do margin in today 's market as many valuations are high and some industries are not trending as they have in the past the leverage will kill you it 's not a question of if it 's a when   you 're new do n't trade anything larger than a $ 5,000 position no matter what do n't hold more than 10 of your portfolio in the same industry do n't be afraid to sit on 50 cash or more for months at a time use money market funds to park cash because they are t+1 settlement and most firms will let you trade the stock without cash as long as you effect the money market trade on the same day since stock settlement is t+3

depending on your location you might have a lot of options to choose from to mitigate your tax burden there might even be a possibility of combining a few options to make a buck or two off of it as someone already mentioned check out conservation easements and reits they can be great ways of your burden another option that i know is available in a number of states is land use tax qualifications that allow for significantly reduced tax rates based on the current zoning use of the land as a timber may not plan on harvesting the timber but you can potentially still qualify for the reduction is the land appropriately assessed appraised make sure you 're not getting ripped off what are your neighboring paying for taxes i would imagine most locales in and around new england would at least have parcel maps in place talk to your neighbors and find out what they do to minimize their costs if all else fails check out or google earth pro and find out the digs on others with similar land holdings make some cold calls be polite and ask many people especially in the country are happy to oblige a friendly neighbor   what would the definition of pristine be what is the age of the trees furthermore what type of trees comprise the are you open to selective if done properly can actually improve the health of your out what you can do with your comprised of sugar maple or some other resource that might be of persistent value do you want to have the land for the sake of having it or do you want to do anything with it if you 're in a semi urban environment you could converse with local hunting disc golf or other groups that might be interested in utilizing the land these uses could potentially be combined with a conservation easement to improve your outcome in more ways than one   keep in mind often times with conservation easements know everything you want out of the land in the long term once the ink is dry the deal is done take your time think about it do what feels right

i think it is the debate here   the functional use case is that it takes seconds to plug in   even if you added all the time i 've spent on the go charging which is very little then the amount of time i 've spent charging has been less than the amount of time i would have spent filling up on gas over the course of several years   also like i said in the comment this is not just my use case   you can ask other drivers about it the vast majority will say they prefer charging now that they have experienced it   look at volts most of their miles are done on electricity and there are a lot of volt drivers who use the term gas anxiety because they do n't want to fill up with gas so they do everything they can not to let the engine turn on at all   and for another car example tesla installed a battery which made the filling up experience more gas like in that it took minutes and cost about $ 50   nobody used it   they instead plugged in at the free supercharger nearby got out to stretch their legs went to eat lunch and came back to their cars and drove off   heck i 've heard plenty of tesla owners that their car charged too quickly which meant they had to get up in the middle of lunch to go unplug it   very few people will regularly need to charge en route in something like a bolt model 3 or model s.   those very few people who routinely drive 300 miles in a day one way or with very little stop at their destination with which they could charge are a niche customer who does not need to be catered to at this moment in time   however and i get this all the time everyone on reddit thinks they 're part of that niche   on a website full of people who talk about spending all their day on reddit somehow these people get the time to spend driving 400 miles a day   not saying you 're doing that right now but lots of people do it here   of charge events will be normal day to day charges where it takes no time the on the go cases are few and far between   ev motorcycles are pretty reasonably priced but it sounds like you 've probably already done some research on them   check out zero if you have n't heard of them   cool thing about them is the battery is small so you can charge it on in a reasonable amount of time overnight and i 've heard from motorcycle drivers that they even feel more safe on an ev because all those brain cycles you spend on shifting and are freed up to spend on paying attention to the road which is full of cars that are trying to kill you   also the bolt is a fantastic car   highly recommend it   edit oh and with your name you should check out the lightning 's results at 's peak a few years ago   beat the by 20 seconds

some thoughts on your questions in order duration you might want to look at the longest dated option often a leap for a couple reasons one is that transaction costs spread plus commission especially spread are killer on options so a longer option means fewer transactions since you do n't have to keep rolling the option two is that any fundamentals based views on stocks might tend to require 3 5 years to relatively reliably work out so if you 're a fundamental investor a 3 6 month option is n't great over 3 6 months momentum short term news short etc can often dominate fundamentals in determining the price one exception is if you just want to hedge a short term event such as a pending announcement on drug approval or something and then you would buy the shortest option that still expires after the event but options are usually super expensive when they span an event like this strike strike price on a long option can be thought of as a tradeoff between the max loss and minimizing insurance costs that is if you buy a deeply in the money put or call the time value will be minimal and thus you are n't paying so much for insurance but you may have 1/3 or 1/2 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss if you buy a put or call at the money then you might have only say 10 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss but almost the whole 10 may be time value insurance cost so you are losing 10 if the underlying stock price stays flat i think of the deep in the money options as similar to buying stocks on margin but the implied interest costs may be less than consumer margin borrowing rates and for long options you ca n't get a margin call the at the money options are more like buying insurance and it 's expensive the commissions and spreads add significant cost on top of the natural time value cost of the option the annual costs would generally exceed the long run average return on a diversified stock fund which is daunting undervalued overvalued options pt 1 first thing is to be sure the options prices on a given underlying make sense at all there are things that should hold for example a synthetic long or short should match up to an actual long or short these kinds of rules can break for example on linkedin after its ipo when shorting was not permitted the synthetic long was quite a bit cheaper than a real long usually though this happens because the arbitrage is not practical for example on the shares to short were n't really available so people doing synthetic shorts with options were driving up the price of the synthetic short and down the price of the synthetic long if you did actually want to be long the stock then the synthetic long was a great deal however a riskless arbitrage buy synthetic long short the stock was not possible and that 's why the prices were messed up another basic relationship that should hold is put call parity undervalued overvalued options pt 2 assuming the relationship to the underlying is sane synthetic positions equivalent to actual positions then the valuation of the option could focus on volatility that is the time value of the option implies the stock will move a certain amount if the time value is high and you think the stock wo n't move much you might short the option while if the time value is low and you think the stock will move a lot you might buy the option you can get implied volatility from your broker perhaps or for example has a bunch of data on option prices and the implied components of the price model i do n't know how useful this really is though the spreads on options are so wide that making money on predicting volatility better than the market is pretty darn hard that is the spread probably exceeds the amount of the mispricing the price of the underlying is more important to the value of an option than the assumed volatility how many contracts each contract is 100 shares so you just match that up if you want to hedge 100 shares buy one contract to get the notional value of the underlying multiply by 100 so say you buy a call for $ 30 and the stock is trading at $ 100 then you have a call on 100 shares which are currently priced at $ 10,000 and the option will cost $ 30 you are leveraged about 3 to 1 this points to an issue with options for individual investors which is that one contract is a pretty large notional value relative to most portfolios

1 as i said the above is not actually anything like a genuine history of how money emerged it 's an explain it to a five year old parable to answer where does the money go in an economic contraction   2 it 's also not defense endorsement apology for any particular set of policies or historical theory of money it 's a picture book describing the workings of an internal combustion engine using cartoon characters not a on the social and environmental implications of american car culture    that said in the parable the reasons why the simplified in the town chose to accept the fiat currency are pretty straightforward and are actually explained   they were previously using a system of a whole bunch of separate privately issued currencies each with complex and hard to evaluate credit risks bob 's potato certificate versus jane 's potato certificate versus your apple certificate versus my deer certificate this was causing problems and confusion about how much any given certificate was actually worth    the system proposed was proposed in a way that was at least as credible as the best existing system    last but not least they accepted the new currency for exactly the same reason that you accept dollar euros or whatever because everyone else does    there was no law preventing any of them from still trading apple ious in fact we still traded them later in the example except denominated in loddars i could have asked you for the last note to denominated in apples but that would probably have been harder to trade than the currency that everyone else is using    i said i would n't get into the gold standard debate and i wo n't and here 's why the debate hinges entirely and solely on whether you believe that a good fiat currency is possible and realistically sustainable if you do then fiat currency makes a lot more sense in every respect if you do n't then fiat currency is always just a catastrophe waiting to happen    my parable shows the mechanics of how money works it does n't say whether the system is good or bad or whether they should have accepted the fiat system proposed or held out for a better one or rejected it altogether    you can argue that internal combustion engines are bad or that much better alternatives are available or that nobody should use them but that does n't make a description of they work incorrect

the price of real estate reacts to both demand for property and the rate of inflation and rate of income growth mortgage rates generally move as treasury rates move see this paragraph as we mentioned intermediate term bonds and long term mortgages more properly mortgage backed securities or mbs compete for the same fixed income investor dollar treasury issues are 100 guaranteed to be repaid but mortgages are not therefore mortgages carry more risk of default or early repayment which could potentially the return on the investment therefore mortgage rates must be priced higher to compensate for that risk but how much higher are mortgages priced in a normal market the average spread or markup above the 100 secured treasury is about 170 basis points or 1.7 that markup the spread relationship widens and contracts with a range of market conditions investor appetites and supply of available product as well as the presence of competing investment opportunities like corporate bonds or domestic or foreign equity markets source what moves mortgage rates and when the stock market crashes investors tend to run to bonds and treasuries which causes prices to go up and treasury yields to drop theoretically this would also cause mortgage rates to drop although most mortgage rates have a base price below which they can not fall how easy is it to profit from recent stock market drops and at what frequency incredibly difficult the issue with your strategy is that you can not predict the bottom of the market at least us mortals ca n't just take the month of august for example stocks fell something like 15 after the first 5 10 drop people felt that the bottom was there so they rushed in only to have the market fall even more   how will you know when to invest even if the market falls by 50 and there 's a huge buying opportunity and you increase the mortgage on your house odds are your rates will increase because of the equity you take out what if the market stays low for a very long time will you be able to maintain mortgage payments japan 's stock bubble popped in the early 90 's and they 've had two lost decade 's now furthermore there are issues of liquidity what if you need more capital can you just sell a property or can you buy now property to draw equity against what if the market is moving too fast for you to take advantage of do n't ignore transaction costs and taxes either   overall there are a lot of ways that your idea can go wrong and not many ways it can go right

largely because stock markets are efficient markets at least mostly if not entirely while the efficient market hypothesis is not necessarily 100 correct for the majority of traders it 's unlikely that you could on the long term find significant market inefficiencies with the tools available to an individual of normal wealth say < $ 500k that 's what frequent trading intends to do find market inefficiencies   if the market is efficient then a stock is priced exactly at what it should be worth based on risk and future returns   if it is inefficient then you can make more money trading on that inefficiency versus simply holding it long   but in stating that a stock is inefficient you are stating that you know something the rest of the market does n't or some condition is different for you than the other million or so people in the market   that 's including a lot of folks who do this for a living and have very expensive modelling software and hardware to run it on   i like to think that i 'm smarter than the far majority of people but i 'm probably not the smartest guy in the room and i certainly do n't have that kind of equipment especially with high frequency trading nowadays as such it 's certainly possible to make a bit of money as a trader versus as a long term investor but on the whole it 's similar to playing poker for a living   if you 're smarter than most of the people in the room you might be able to make a bit of money but the overhead in the case of poker the money the house charges for the game in the case of stocks the exchange fees and broker commissions means that it 's a losing game for the group as a whole and not very many people can actually make money   add to that the computer based trading so imagine a poker game where four of the eight players are computer models that are really good and actively maintained by very smart traders and you can see where it gets to be very difficult to trade at a profit versus long term investments which take advantage of the growth in value in the company finally the risk because of leverage and option trading which is necessary to really take advantage of inefficiencies makes it not only hard to make a profit but easy to lose everything   again to the poker analogy the guys i 've known playing poker for a living do it by playing 10 20 games at once because one game is n't efficient enough you would n't make enough money   in poker you can do that fairly safely especially in limit games but in the market if you 're leveraging your money you risk losing a lot   every action you take to make it safer removes some of your profit

when you have multiple assets available and a risk free asset cash or borrowing you will always end up them if you have a reasonable objective function   however you seem to have constrained yourself to 100 investment   combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio   the fact that you describe the us fund as dominating the fund indicates that this may be the case for you   ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset dominates another but it may not in your special case notice that these funds are both already highly diversified so all you are getting is cross border diversification by getting more than one   that may be why you are getting the solution you are   i 've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy with some reliable results   fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones   however getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible   unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs   for that reason most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition but seldom do the math for our own portfolio   in any model you use your weak link is the expected return and covariance   more sophisticated models do n't usually help produce a more reasonable result for that reason your original strategy 80 20 sounds pretty good to me   not sure why you are not diversifying outside of equities but i suppose you have your reasons

if you want to see a more academic version of this look up weighted average cost of capital wacc    it 's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $ 1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks    one thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans even if you do n't need it you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company the thought process is as it states in the article above that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate    i tried to give an example but i only ended up what it says in the article anyhow look up wacc and you 'll understand the fundamentals

as already noted options contain inherent leverage a multiplier on the profit or loss the amount of leverage is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement with a stock you could choose to buy and hold forever buffett style and even if you are wrong for 5 years your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later but with options the profits and losses become very final very quickly as a professional options trader the single best piece of advice i can give to investors in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly itm in the money options for both calls and puts do a web search on in the money options to see what calls or puts qualify   with itm options the leverage is still noticeably better than buying selling the shares outright but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium also by being fairly deep in the money you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen the market moves sideways more than people usually expect to deeply itm options are the ones that options market makers like least to trade in because they offer neither large nor easy premiums and options market makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you so connect the dots by trading only itm options until you become quite experienced you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker all else equal some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long expiration options like leaps for 1 + years that are not itm like atm or otm options the problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait   with an itm option your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk thus my recommendation to initially deal only in to deeply itm options with expirations of 1 4 months out depending on how you wish to be with your move timing

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

this was an article meant for mass consumption written by a yale law professor and an individual who has a phd in economics in addition to his practical on the job experience managing the yale endowment   i 'm having a hard time believing that it was poorly argued   as for proof that 's the sort of thing you find in financial and economic journals for example the effect of maker taker fees on investor order choice and execution quality in u.s. stock     one of the direct takeaways from the above paper states   i find that total trading cost to investors increases when the taker fee and maker rebate increase even if the net fee is held fixed the total trading cost represents the net of fees bid ask spread and the brokerage commission to an investor wanting to buy and then sell the same stock   i 'm not here to argue for the paper   i 'm really here to tell you that these guys have far more of a clue than you realize   dash of humility on your part may be in order given the fact that you 've already admitted to the reality that you are n't sure of any of this   edit   thought i was responding to a different thread

private companies can serve the campaign donation needs of congress the usps ca n't   that 's the driving force behind privatization in the us raising campaign funds is the one thing congress is good at government agencies are n't allowed to make political donations but they can be replaced with private companies that can replace well paid workers who might donate to democrats with corporate executives who donate to republicans and minimum wage workers who ca n't afford to donate to anyone taxpayers get to pay even more because competition only lowers prices in profitable markets while government provides unprofitable but necessary services   for example the usps is required to provide universal service which is costly but contributes to a better society and a more robust economy fedex and ups do n't want to service rural locations cities and suburbs are more profitable

for customer accounts that you have with a merchant normally a positive balance in the account is what you owe the merchant when you have a credit on the account or a negative balance it usually means that it is an amount that the merchant owes you this could be because you paid too much or perhaps it is because the merchant is giving you a refund for some reason   however it is always a possibility that this particular merchant is not using the terminology in the conventional way if you are n't sure the best thing to do is to ask the merchant directly by contacting their customer service department   just judging from the screenshot you posted it looks to me like they owe you some money i suggest you click the statement button it looks like that will generate some type of statement that will instruct the merchant to send you a refund but that is only a guess their customer service should be able to tell you what to do

yesterday there were a pair of shoes a deer and a bushel of apples in the world today of those three things there is only a pair of shoes and a deer   your legal expertise might be able to find some kind of recoverable asset to get the shoemaker back his money but even the supreme court can not rule the destroyed value back into existence the economy is poorer than it was before the fire no matter how we move the loddars the loddars are just markers for the underlying value of actual stuff goods and services that are actually useful    analogies are problematic because they are inaccurate but as a half measure explanation you could imagine that the loddars are poker chips   four people down to play a game of poker and each puts $ 20 cash into a kitty and takes out $ 20 worth of chips    a freak of wind comes along and blows one of the $ 20 bills out the window    now there is only $ 60 in the kitty even though we each have $ 20 in chips as a lawyer you might be able to identify some person who is liable for that $ 20 shortage but as an economist i see that this little economy is now $ 20 poorer and no matter how well anyone plays the total output of the poker play is going to produce less than $ 80 value    now go back and pretend that the poker chips are instead cash currency and the cash in the kitty is actual goods and services again analogies are problematic you can move the markers around however you want but but some part of the underlying value has been destroyed

as other answers state selling the options contracts to the market is a definite way out and probably the best in most cases   if you 're determined to exercise your options or there 's not enough liquidity to reasonably sell your contracts to the market then you could plan ahead and exercise smaller number of contracts at a time and sell the resulting position in the underlying which will give you funds to exercise some more contracts and sell the underlying     if you think you 're going down this path however make sure that you take into account your broker 's rules for settlement   you may need to start the exercise sell cycle before the option 's expiration date

my parents and i were suckered into buying this kind of thing when i was in high school the sales people literally told us that it could be used to pay off student loans they left out the in the event of your death part we knew it was a life insurance policy but were told that it would mature 6 months after graduation from college and that it would then be disbursed to pay off loans even if i did n't die that seemed strange to us so we explicitly asked several different ways whether it would pay off the loans after graduation even if i lived and they just straight up told us yes i 'm guessing this ploy is still being used also last i checked student loans are non transferable in the unfortunate event that your child dies which means the loan is forgiven anyway so this whole thing seems like garbage to me at least in the student loan sense i would steer clear from this stuff it 's pure snake oil in my experience

the $ 20k limit seems to be from another answer the threshold for gofundme to report the campaign however such a report does not change the taxability of the income the income is either taxable or non taxable regardless of whether the amount is $ or $ this is a common misconception commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below $ 600 when in reality $ 600 is the threshold for issuing a form 1099 given that it would be foolish to close a wildly successful gofundme campaign because closing the campaign wo n't change the taxability of the income but it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received with the amount of money at stake you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a cpa to look at your specific situation your uncle 's comments are not specific to your situation at best incorrect at worst so do n't hire him i do n't know what the median gofundme campaign raises but i strongly suspect it 's well below the $ donor reporting limit just because you have one campaign that 's gone viral enough to approach that limit does n't mean if you close that one and start a new one that it will go viral again especially if it 's under a new username

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

after collecting information via web searching the comments above and a additional call to boa i have concluded the following to the best of my knowledge zelle transfers are final irreversible as jay mentioned above funds are subtracted from the sending account before the transfer is made therefore it eliminates sending funds that do not exist i validated this information with boa and the boa representative said that once a zelle transfer is initiated and the receiving party has received the funds it can no longer be canceled funds received by the receiving party is credited immediately i will note that the boa representative was a boa representative and not a zelle representative i say this because the representatives seemed to be slightly weary in answering my questions about zelle as if he was looking up the information as we spoke if someone is reading this and plans to transfer huge amount of cash from a highly likely malicious user i would recommend contacting zelle or your personal bank directly to further validate this information zelle from what i can find is a fairly new technology i could not find a zelle contact number via the web for questioning so i can only rely on the knowledge on my boa representative

has the vix always received this much attention i feel like i never really saw articles on it until about 2 years ago and the attention has especially ramped up post election granted i 'm young and may have just not been aware   as the post to i think a big problem is people 's interpretation of vix being the market expectation of volatility in a mathematical sense that would only be valid if 1 the price of options perfectly reflects volatility and 2 investors can rationally evaluate the future    1 is arguable as volatility is just the single free parameter in bs and captures all factors in the price including supply demand 2 is debatable just because it essentially assumes that the wisdom of crowds will be true on average my prior on this is that they 're correct that often and that the vix is probably a pretty poor predictor of future realized volatility i 'll check this last claim and edit

why do people keep talking about 401 k 's at work   that is not dollar cost averaging   dca refers to when you have a large sum of money   do you invest it all at once or spread it out over several smaller purchases over a period of time   there really is n't a when should i use it   it is simply a matter of where your preferences lie on the risk reward   dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing   in my opinion i do n't like it   dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops   but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000   do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a tradeoff   but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

there may be specific answers that can be determined based on the interest rates amounts tax provisions etc but i 'm here to tell you it is much easier i.e. less stressful to own a home when you have less debt pay off any and every debt you can before purchasing a home because there will always be something requiring you to spend money once you own one

you 've already got a well thought analysis of the problem done that 's a good start how much can you dumb down the explanation of why your product is better i mean i do n't even know what you 're selling but your description of the product made me believe you so i 'd argue you 're convincing enough maybe all you need is to to your costumers and bring them down to earth examples of why your product will help them on a daily basis dumb down stuff as much as you want maybe be passionate about your product as you 're being now we buy stuff based more on emotion than reason most of the time anyway

who the fuck cares about exhausting sorry dude that is not the criteria   you examples are and non responsive to my points but one more time to humor you nope your janitor who did not study to get a degree so he can not get your ex 's job while your ex can get the janitor job if she wanted to so nope one is going to get paid better   brain surgery will put your gf at upper middle lower upper class   btw saying but to argue cleaning kids and shit off the bathroom floor takes less skill and should be paid less yeah no is not a valid argument it is your opinion and by this point in the conversation it is no longer necessary to repeat yourself in you can repeat it till you are blue in the face and it will still remain your unsubstantiated opinion not only is the fact that cleaning requires less skill one of the reasons why janitors get paid less but to boot the fact that it requires less skill means that more people can do the job and basic supply demand inevitable leads to lower price which in this case is lower salary   the fact is that there will always be a lower class it being the part below the middle class and it takes skills to pull oneself out or luck to be born rich which i do agree is unfortunate if you have no skills or chose to work a job that does not require skill you will be in the lower class    so now besides a basic english class you seem to need a basic logic class i 'd suggest looking that stuff up online or if you need the more structured environment your local community college

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

your house is not an asset it is a liability assets feed you eat you robert kiyosaki from a cash flow perspective your primary residence ie your house is an investment but it is not an asset if you add up all the income your primary residence generates and subtract all the expenses it incurs you will see why investment gurus claim this perform the same calculations for a rental property and you 're more likely to find it has a positive cash flow if it has a negative cash flow it 's not an asset either it 's a liability a rental property with a negative cash flow is still an investment but cash flow gurus will tell you it 's a bad investment while it is possible that your house may increase in value and you may be able to sell it for more than you paid will you be able to sell it for more than all of the expenses incurred while living there if so you have an asset   some people will purchase a home in need of repair live in it and upgrade it sell it for profit exceeding all expenses and repeat these people are flipping houses and generating capital gains based on their own hard work in this instance a person 's primary residence can be an asset how much of an asset is calculated when the renovated house is sold

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

but speculation is absolutely intended to happen and is considered necessary for healthy a investment environment   what i am saying however is that this desire to rid the world of hft appears to be moral rather than logical there is very little reason to eliminate hft as it stands although there appears to be a propensity for very emotional responses to the basic concept ones i can appreciate however i am suggesting they are misguided as the people who should be upset with hft are the hedge fund managers and day traders they are not you or me who buy and sell shares on a whim every so often if you want to ban day traders that is a separate argument i do n't want to go into   the idea that these computer algorithms are all set to sell sell sell is provably nonsensical if that were the case all of the hft participants would have gone massively bankrupt during the flash crashes also it is quite patently the case that somebody has to be buying in order for anybody to sell saying this is what caused some of the crashes is just your desire for a simple explanation it must have been more complex than this and to my knowledge none of these crashes have been adequately explained although some poorly designed algorithms have been note that in one of these cases iirc a fund closed its doors due to the losses and the market was largely unaffected so it seems like a problem that self corrects in this case and one that only harms the participant that   also to correct a basic misunderstanding selling happens all of the time and does not inherently drive the price down there are by definition an equal number of sales to what drives the price down is the people buying being willing to pay   edit as another aside a point i have made elsewhere and seems suitable to make here flash crashes whilst causing panic are again something only the professional intra day trading community are likely to be affected by their very name implies so the reason being that anybody investing based on the long term investment potential of a company will only benefit in the temporary drop in price as they can purchase more of the company at a bargain price any intelligent investor will not be by the drop in price as price has no bearing on a company 's real value and stocks do tend towards this value over time whatever happens over the short term the only case in which it could is if the company owns a large portfolio of stock that itself devalues dramatically that they intended to sell and as a result experience cash flow problems this is so incredibly unlikely with a flash crash as to be ignored

is a latin phrase that simply means irregular deposit it 's a concept from ancient roman contract law that has a very narrow scope and does n't actually apply to your example there are two distinct parts to this concept one dealing with the notion of a deposit and the other with the notion of i 'll address them both in turn since they 're both relevant to the tax issue i also think that this is an example of the problem since your proposed solution give my money to a friend for safekeeping is n't the right solution to your actual problem how can i keep my money safe the currency issue is a complication but it does n't change the fact that what you 're proposing probably is n't a good solution the key word in my definition of is contract you do n't mention a legally binding contract between you and your friend an oral contract does n't qualify because in the event of a breach it 's difficult to enforce the agreement legally there is n't any proof of an oral agreement and emotionally taking your friend to court might cost you your friendship i 'm not a lawyer but i would guess that the absence of a contract implies that even though in the eyes of you and your friend you 're giving him the money for safekeeping in the eyes of the law you 're simply giving it to him in the us you would owe gift taxes on these funds if they 're higher than a certain amount in other words this is n't really a deposit it 's not like a security deposit in which the money may be held as collateral in exchange for a service e.g. not trashing your apartment or a financial deposit where the money is held in a regulated financial institution like a bank this is n't a solution to the problem of keeping your money safe because the lack of a contract means you incur additional risk in the form of legal risk that is n't present in the context of actual deposits also if you do n't have an account in the right currency but your friend does how are you planning for him to store the money anyway if you convert your money into his currency you take on exchange rate risk unless you hedge which is another complication if you do n't convert it and simply leave it in his safe house car boot etc you 're still taking on risk because the funds are n't insured in the event of loss   furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend even if you ignore all the risks above without a written contract you have little recourse if a your friend decides to spend the money and not return it b your friend runs into financial trouble and creditors make claim to his assets or c you get into financial trouble and creditors make claims to your assets the idea of giving money to another individual for safekeeping during bankruptcy has been tested in us courts and ruled invalid if you do decide to go ahead with a contract and you do want your money back from your friend eventually you 're in essence loaning him money and this is a different situation with its own complications look at this question and this question before loaning money to a friend although this does apply to your situation it 's mostly irrelevant because the irregular part of the concept of irregular deposit is a standard feature of currencies and other legal tender it 's part of the of modern currencies and does n't have anything to do with taxes if you 're only giving your friend physical currency if you 're giving him property other assets etc for safekeeping it 's a different issue entirely but it 's still probably going to be considered a gift or a loan you 're basically correct about what means but i think you 're overestimating its reach in modern law in roman times it simply refers to a contract in which two parties made an agreement for the depositor to deposit money or goods with the and withdraw equivalent money or goods sometime in the future although this is a feature of the modern deposit banking system it 's one small part alongside contract law deposit insurance etc these other parts add complexity but they also add security and risk mitigation your arrangement with your friend is much simpler but also much riskier   and yes there probably are taxes on what you 're proposing because you 're basically giving or loaning the money to your friend even if you say it 's not a loan or a gift the law may still see it that way the absence of a contract makes this especially important because you do n't have anything speaking in your favor in the event of a legal dispute besides what you meant the money to be furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend and the absence of a contract exacerbates this issue if you want to keep your money safe keep it in an account that 's covered by deposit insurance if you do n't have an account in that currency either a talk to a lawyer who specializes in situation like this and work out a contract or b open an account with that currency as i 've stated i 'm not a lawyer so none of the above should be interpreted as legal advice that being said i 'll reiterate again that the concept of is a concept from ancient roman law trying to apply it within a modern legal system without a contract is a potential recipe for disaster if you need a legal solution to this problem not that you do i think what you 're looking for is a bank talk to a lawyer who understands modern law since ancient roman law is n't applicable to and wo n't pass muster in a modern day court

you do n't seem to have any particular question to be answered your understanding of rrsps seems to be very good   have you considered whether you might be better off putting your retirement savings into a tfsa instead both types can protect your growth from taxation provided you reinvest the refund from the rrsp the main way in which the rrsp is better than tfsa is that you can pay the tax on the contribution at a time when your income is lower and thus have a lower marginal tax rate most people retire with a lower income than during their earning years but it 's a matter of tax brackets if you think you 'll be in the same bracket same marginal tax rate when you retire then the tfsa and rrsp work out even in that regard so in your case the question you want to ask yourself is when i retire will i have an income including cpp oas pension payments etc that exceeds $ worth of today 's dollars if so your rrsp holds no advantage over the tfsa in fact the rrsp may even be worse since the withdrawals count as income and reduce the amount of oas and perhaps payments that the government gives you at least under current regulations if you 're unsure i suggest you try this calculator from that runs both scenarios and helps you see which one is more beneficial it even factors in the oas

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

first corporate profits can grow relative to gdp   if companies succeed in growing revenue without paying much more to workers then corporate profits and stock prices will grow relative to gdp   that has been happening for the last couple decades   if you require that we keep corporate profits vs gdp constant then borrowing leverage is how you do it   companies can expand their operations on a fixed amount of shareholder equity and as long as they can grow their profits faster than the cost of the debt then shareholders keep the upside   but this also means that share prices will quickly fall if profits decline even a small amount because the debt must still be paid off

gt;however the caveat i will add is that if you go into debt for your education you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you   i agree but we 're not going to have that discussion when many parents do n't understand debt accurately and the ones that do are the ones whose kids are n't as likely to need big loans    gt;at the end of the day though these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to free aka subsidized education    the hyperinflation is n't because college costs are subsidized federal loans still have caps it 's because student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy in the vast majority of cases that means that private loans are available which means the federal loan caps are effectively useless    free college would have its challenges and we 'd need to make private loans in bankruptcy which would in turn make banks lend to only credit worthy students co signers using appropriate risk models but then we 'd also be able to make other adjustments    there are some things that we could probably be doing now but others might be too easily corruptible without the market correction of private loans only to those who are credit qualified   we could put more stringent requirements on grade point averages for example if you do n't hit that you do n't get your free college you can continue going if you go get private loans not able to qualify time to do something else then work and save for college trade school enter the workforce permanently etc this would n't work as well if private loans were still easily and non because there could be shady dealings to make more people not eligible for the free assistance with some type of crazy obstacles etc   we could do things like cap the costs for particular programs if you want to study mechanical engineering you can get up to x amount but if you 're studying early french you can only get up to y amount yes we could do that now but i do n't love the idea of putting those type of restrictions when it 's the student paying it seems a bit of an    there are lots of ways we could be addressing things but we are n't

let 's say there 's a product worth $ 10 in july and the inflation rate in august is 10 will it then cost $ 11 in august yes   that 's basically what inflation means however   the monthly inflation numbers you typically see are generally a year over year inflation rate on that month   meaning august 2017 inflation is 10 that means inflation was 10 since last july 2016 not since july 2017 at the micro consumer level inflation is very very very vague   some sectors of the economy will inflate faster than the general inflation rate others will be slower or even deflate   sometimes a price increase comes with a value increase so it 's not really inflation   and lastly month over month inflation is n't something you will feel   inflation is measured on the whole economy but actual prices move in steps   a pear today might cost $ 1 and a pear in five years might cost $ 1.10   that 's 10 over 5 years or about 2 per year but the actual price change might have been as abrupt as yesterday a pear was $ 1 and now it 's $ 1.10   all of the prices of over all of the country wo n't be the same    inflation is a measure of everything in the economy roughly blended together to come up with a general value for the loss in purchasing power of a currency and is applicable over long periods   a usd inflation rate of 3 does not mean the pear you spent $ 1 on today will necessarily cost $ 1.03 next year

let 's take a step back my fictional company a is a solid old established company it 's in consumer staples so people buy the products in good times and bad it has a dividend of $ only knowing this you have to decide how much you would be willing to pay for one share   you might decide that $ 20 is fair why because that 's a 5 return on your money 1/20 = 5 and given the current rates you 're happy for a 5 dividend but this company does n't give out all its earnings as a dividend it really earns $ 1.50 so the p e you are willing to pay is or   many companies offer no dividend but of course they still might have earnings and the p e is one metric that used to judge whether one wishes to buy a stock   a high p e implies the buyers think the stock will have future growth and they are to pay more today to hold it a low p e might be a sign the company is solid but not growing if such a thing is possible

i 'm pretty sure you already know this so i 'm probably just wasting time you know i ca n't think of a better analogy to the whole global warming debate than this 97 number a misleading statistic that means nothing is used to mislead the public the origin of this number was a survey of over 10,000 earth scientists in climate related fields a few years back first it was a non scientific survey and only 3000 people bothered to respond the two questions were   the first when compared with levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen fallen or remained relatively constant few would be expected to dispute this the planet began out of the little ice age in the middle 19th century the industrial revolution that was the period since the last real ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago 97 of skeptics would answer yes to this   the 2nd do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures so what constitutes significant does changing include both cooling and warming and for both better and worse and which contributions does this include land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation once again many skeptics would answer yes   surprisingly of the 3000 respondents only 82 answered yes to both questions so there is your real consensus well this was n't acceptable of course so they through the 3000 and found 79 that they classified as climate scientists 76 of 79 responded yes to the first question what the heck we have real published scientists who do n't even think the earth has warmed so then 2 of the 3 who answered no to the first question did n't answer the second question i think it is fair to say that if they think there was no warming then they did n't feel that mankind had contributed but for the survey they just reported 75 of 77 97 plus responded yes to the 2nd question so even using their own picking of a subset of 3000 that got the answer they wanted they still cheated and reported the 97 statistic since the honest 95 answer did n't sound good enough to them now that 's the true origin of the statistic and you could probably get 90 of skeptics to agree to the two questions   and none of the questions address the real thing being debated what is the real feedback going to be from co2 warming you ca n't even get a consensus on whether it will be positive or negative

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

another thing that insurance companies try to do with these types of vehicles is to promote the cash value of the policy the longer you participate in the policy the more your cash value goes up assuming the investments perform reasonably well the selling point is that at any time you can take out part of that cash value without impacting your insurance policy a lot of people see that benefit as being the same as either putting the money in the bank or investing it when actually they could do better if they did either of those things themselves one true advantage of the whole term policy is that if you should fall on hard times and are not able to work the premium payments can be taken out of the cash value that way even if you ca n't make the monthly payments the insurance policy basically pays for itself i actually experienced this myself many years ago after i lost my job and had some health issues i was out of work a long time but my life insurance never lapsed that in itself made it worthwhile for me

what you 're describing is a non deductible traditional ira   that is what happens when your employer 401 k or your high income from using a traditional ira the normal way    yes non deductible traditional iras are stupid    now let 's be clear on the mechanism behind the difference   there 's an of tax law that the same money ca n't be taxed twice   this is baked so deep into tax law that it often is n't even specified particularly   the irs is not allowed to impose tax on money already taxed i.e. the original contribution on an nd trad ira   so this is not a new kind of ira it is simply a trad ira with an   but then some say so are deductible traditional iras when compared to the roth    the real power of an nd trad ira is that it can be converted to roth at all income levels   this is called the roth backdoor   it combines three factors contribute to an nd trad ira stick it in a money market sweep fund and a week later convert to roth pay taxes on the 17 cents of growth in the sweep fund since the rest was already taxed   the net effect is to work the same as a roth contribution not tax deductible becomes a roth and is not taxed on distribution    if you already have traditional ira money that you contributed that was n't taxed this really screws things up   because you ca n't segment or lifo your ira money the irs considers it one huge bucket and requires you draw in proportion eek suppose you contribute $ 5000 to an ira in a non deductible mode   but you also have a different ira funded with pretax money that now has $ 45,000    as far as irs is concerned you have one $ 50,000 ira and only $ 5000 10 is post tax    you convert $ 5000 to roth and irs says 90 of that money is taxable since it 's the same pool of money   you owe taxes on all of it less the $ 500 fraction that was pre taxed and $ 4500 of already taxed ira remains in the account   the math gets totally out of hand after just a couple of conversions    your best bet is to convert the whole at one time and to avoid a monstrous tax hit do this in a gap year

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

krugman nobel prize in economy has just said greek euro exit very possibly next month huge withdrawals from spanish and italian banks as depositors try to move their money to germany maybe just possibly de facto controls with banks forbidden to    transfer deposits out of country and limits on cash withdrawals 3b alternatively or maybe in tandem huge draws on ecb credit to    keep the banks from collapsing germany has a choice accept huge indirect public claims on italy    and spain plus a drastic revision of strategy basically to give    spain in particular any hope you need both guarantees on its debt to    hold borrowing costs down and a higher eurozone inflation target to    make relative price adjustment possible or 4b end of the euro and we ’re talking about months not years for this to play out

unless they 're the actual employers the is none of their business your employer must verify your eligibility for employment on the first day of your employment i.e. when you find a job you 'll have to fill anyway the only reason i can think for them to do it is to verify that you 're eligible for employment before they waste any time on searching for a job for you i 'm not sure if they 're legally allowed to ask for your status so maybe that 's their way of working around that i do n't think they can require you to fill and in fact i 'm not sure if its even legal for them to obtain that information without actually being your employers imho that is consult with an attorney if you want a proper legal advice

after reading op mark 's question and the various answers carefully and also looking over some old pay stubs of mine i am beginning to wonder if he is mis reading his pay stub or slip of paper attached to the reimbursement check for the he purchases   pay stubs whether paper documents attached to checks or things received in one 's company mailbox or available for downloading from a company web site while the money is deposited electronically into the employee 's checking account vary from company to company but a reasonably well designed stub would likely have categories such as taxable gross income for the pay period this is the amount from which payroll taxes federal and state income tax social security and medicare tax are deducted as well as other post tax deductions such as money going to purchase of us savings bonds contributions to united way via payroll   deduction contribution to roth 401k etc employer paid group life   insurance premiums are taxable income too for any portion of the policy   that exceeds $ 50k. in some cases these appear as a lump sum on the last pay stub for the year nontaxable gross income for the pay period this would be sum total of the amounts contributed to 401k plans employee 's share of group health care insurance premiums for employee   and/or employee 's family money deposited into fsa accounts etc net pay this is the amount of the attached check or money sent via ach to the employee 's bank account year to date amounts these just tell the employee what has been earned paid withheld to date in the various categories now op mark said my company does not tax the reimbursement but they do add it to my running gross earnings total for the year so the question is whether the amount of the reimbursement is included in the year to date amount of taxable income if ytd taxable income does not include the reimbursement amount   then the the op 's question and the answers and comments are moot unless the company has really messed up pat pending payroll software that does weird things the amount   on the w2 form will be whatever is shown as ytd taxable income   on the last pay stub of the year and as noted it is what will appear on the w2 form that really matters in summary it is good that op mark is taking the time to investigate the matter of the reimbursements appearing in total gross income but if the amounts are not appearing in the ytd taxable income his payroll office may just him that they have good software and that what the ytd taxable income says on the last pay stub is what will be appearing on his w2 form   i am fairly confident that this is what will be the resolution of the matter because if the amount of the reimbursement was included in taxable income during that pay period and no tax was withheld then the employer has a problem with   social security and medicare tax and nonpayment of this tax plus the employer 's share to the us treasury in timely fashion the irs takes an extremely view of such shenanigans and most employers are unlikely to take the risk

keeping your big emergency fund in stocks if you have 12 months income saved is ok    however you should keep your small emergency fund in cash    however i find that even my stock broker accounts have some cash in them as i like to let the dividends build up enough to make the dealing charges worthwhile   you do n’t wish to be forced to sell at a bad time due to your boiler needing replacing or your car breaking down      however if you lost your job in the same week that your boiler broke down and your car needed replacing then being forced to sell stocks at a bad time is not much of an issue also if you are saving say 1/3 of your income each month and you have a credit card with large unused credit limit that is paid of each month then most small emergency that are under 2/3 of your monthly income can be covered on the credit card with little or no interest charges one option is to check you bank balance on the day after you are paid and if it is more than 2x your monthly income then move some of it to long term savings but only if you tend to spend a lot less then you earn most months

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

let me ask you another question if that person stayed at home and made a widget instead would exporting that widget benefit his home country there is no difference economically between the two situations a foreign worker sending home remittances is no different from a local manufacturer exporting their products both are earning export dollars for themselves and their home countries is this a good thing or a bad thing clearly the answer is yes this is a good thing or a bad thing but we can not know which in isolation however in general foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly beneficial for the host which gets work done that otherwise would not be done and the source which gets export income with reference to your particular question about local inflation a rise in exports causes appreciation in the exchange rate i.e. local currency becomes more expensive with respect to in this case the euro appreciation in the exchange rate actually puts downward pressure on inflation however the absence of our worker from the local economy puts upward pressure on local wages and and hence inflation both of these effects are small and other factors will dominate them

it depends on how much you save how much your savings earns each year   you can model it with a very simple spreadsheet   formula view   you can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model this spreadsheet presumes that you only make $ never get a raise that your savings earns 6 per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008 the article never states the assumptions that the author has made and therefore we ca n't honestly determine how truthful the author is   i recommend the book engineering your retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details about what you should expect i wrote a slightly more detailed post that showed a spreadsheet that is basically what i use at home to track my retirement savings

i have to seriously disagree with this automated news analysis may have not worked for you for a variety of reasons most likely all related to infrastructure software inexperience but it works and some shops and funds have made fortunes just doing news based automated trading   i have personal experience working in a chicago shop which went through a few off the shelf solutions like services before rolling a custom news analytics platform which integrated with quantitative strategies to move a lot of volume   the whole premise of your post just seems very off to me the problem that arises is that it is nearly impossible to make money off of automating trades an entire segment of the industry would like to have a word with you

your withholding is taken out of your pay so if you do you count the withholding twice that 's why it does n't add up for you the simple answer is to check your written contract offer letter see if it matches what you see or what you expected to see if the offer contract states $ 36 k check with the payroll person at work why the discrepancy if you do n't have any written proof of the agreed amounts do n't know if it is legal check local laws on the requirements of documenting employment terms then it is up to you and your employer to sort it out however keep in mind if you do n't have any written proof and the employer is unwilling to adjust one judge would wonder you 've been getting paychecks monthly which clearly state that your annual salary is $ why did you wait so long to sort this out

that 's a broad question but i can throw some thoughts at you from personal experience   i 'm actually an australian who has worked in a couple of companies but across multiple countries and i 've found out first hand that you have a wealth of opportunities that other people do n't have but you also have a lot of problems that other people wo n't have first up asset classes real estate is a popular asset class but unless you plan on being in each of these countries for a minimum of one to two years it would be seriously risky to invest in rental residential or commercial real estate this is because it takes a long time to figure out each country 's particular set of laws around real estate plus it will take a long time to get credit from the local bank institutions and to understand the local markets well enough to select a good location this leaves you with the classics of stocks and bonds you can buy stocks and bonds in any country typically so you could have some stocks in a german company a bond fund in france and maybe a mutual fund in japan this makes for interesting diversification so if one country tanks you can potentially be hedged in another you also get to both benefit and be punished by foreign exchange movements you might have made a killing on that stock you bought in tokyo but it turns out the yen just fell by 15 and to top this off you are almost certainly going to end up filling out tax returns in each country you have made money in this can get horribly complicated very quickly as a person who has been dealing with the us tax system i can tell you that this is painful and the us in particular tries to get a cut of your worldwide income that said keep in mind each country has different tax rates so you could potentially benefit from that as well my advice choose one country you suspect you 'll spend most of your life in and keep most of your assets there make a few purchases in other places but minimize it ultimately most ex move back to their country of origin as friends family and shared culture bring them home

yes there is a delay between when you buy a stock and when you actually take ownership of it   this is called the settlement period the settlement period for us equities is t+2 other markets have different settlement periods meaning you do n't actually become a shareholder of record until 2 business days after you buy   conversely you do n't stop being a shareholder of record until 2 business days after you sell presumably at some point in the far future all public markets will move to same day changes of ownership at which point companies will stop making announcements of the form all shareholders of record as of september 22nd and will switch to announcements of the form all shareholders of record as of september 22nd at utc

here is how the visa network works a visa transaction is a carefully orchestrated process when a visa    account holder uses a visa card to buy a pair of shoes it ’s actually    the acquirer the merchant ’s bank that reimburses the merchant for    the shoes then the issuer the account holder ’s bank reimburses    the acquirer usually within 24 to 48 hours lastly the issuer    collects from the account holder by withdrawing funds from the account    holder ’s bank account if a debit account is used or through billing    if a credit account is used i read this to mean the merchant 's bank the acquirer bank gives the merchant the money within 2 days via the card issuer 's bank the issuing bank is the one that provides the credit feature since that bank wo n't get reimbursed until the shopper 's bill is paid or perhaps even longer if the shopper carries a balance you 'll notice the credit card company visa mc etc is only involved in the process as a way of passing messages of course they take a fee for this service so seller ultimately get 's less than the buyer bought the shoes for

use one journal entry and split the expenses into the appropriate accounts this can happen even if you never mix business and personal on the same receipt say you order office supplies which where i live are immediately deductible as an expense and software or hardware which must be depreciated because they are assets on the same order we have an account called proprietors loan which represents money the company is lending to the humans who own it or that the humans are lending to the company were i to pay for my personal lunch on a business credit card it would go through that account increasing the amount the company has lent me or decreasing the amount i have lent it similarly if i made a business purchase with a personal card it would go through that account in the other direction where i live i can lend my company all the money i want any time but if the company lends me money there ca n't be an outstanding balance over the corporate year end if you make two credit card entries of 5 and 10 when you go to reconcile your accounts it will be harder because you 'll have to realize they together match the single 15 line on your statement making a single entry your a option will make reconciling your statement much easier and that way you 'll probably reconcile your statements which is vital to knowing you actually recorded everything

time value of money the simple calculation for this is fv = pv which reads the future value is equal to the present value times 1 plus the interest rate multiplied by itself by the number of periods that will pass a simple way to look at this is that if interest rates were a dollar would be worth where n is the number of years passing   the concept of compound interest can not be separated from the above compounding is accounting for the interest on the interest that has accrued in prior periods if i lend you a dollar at 6 simple interest for 30 years you would pay me back $ 1 + $ or $ 2.80 but 1.06 ^ 30 = so that dollar compounded at 6 annually for 30 years is $ quite a difference   often the time value of money is discussed in light of inflation a dollar today is not the same dollar as 30 years ago or 30 years hence in fact inflation has eroded the value of the dollar by a factor of 3 over the past 30 years an average item costing $ 100 would now cost $ 300 so when one invests at the very least they try to stay ahead of inflation and seek additional return for their risk   one of compounding is the rule of 72 this rule states that if you divide the interest rate into the number 72 the result is the number of years to double so 10 per year will take about 7.2 years to double 8 9 years etc it 's not 100 precise but a good back of napkin calculation   when people talk about the total payments over the thirty year life of a mortgage they often ignore the time value of money that payment even ten years from now has far less value than the same payment today

the best thing for you to do will be to start using the cash flow report instead of the income and expense report go to reports > income and expense > cash flow once the report is open open the edit window and open the accounts tab   there choose your various cash accounts checking saving etc   in the general tab choose the reporting period   and then save the report settings so you do n't need to go hunting for your cash accounts each time gnucash will display for you all the inflows and outflows of money which appears to be what you really want though gnucash does n't present the cash flow in a way that matches united states accounting rules with sections for operating investing and financial cash flows separated it is certainly fine for your personal use if you want the total payment to show up as one line on the cash flow report you will need to book the accrual of interest and the payment to the mortgage bank as two separate entries normal entry for mortgage payments which shows up as a line for mortgage and a line for interest on your cash flow pair of entries to make full mortgage payment show up as one line on cash flow entry 1   interest accrual entry 2   full mortgage payment tested in gnucash

i can safely assume that a credit union or a bank probably a bank based on the size of the short term loan would allow use of the annuity as collateral for the loan since the future payouts from the annuity will more than cover the total costs coming due for your education i 'm sure the bank will have no problem loaning the money and you can see if doing a direct payment monthly to them will reduce the rate you can try a credit union since they will most likely give you a more favorable rate if you can get a credit union to do it you will most likely be paying a lot less but typically they want interest paid monthly and not at the end of the 6 months term   there is also a service called or tuition management services which you can find at tuition management services they typically also expect monthly payments but might do an alternative for you they charge i believe a $ fee to use their service also just flat out bank shop and demand the lowest rate its guaranteed money so you should be paying libor plus 1 at most see if you can direct your next payout to them with the balance coming to you

watch this super late post to a 2009 thread   thread in action yes it 's absolutely worth it to get an extended warranty because electronics just do n't last as long as they used to this is ever more prevalent in the year 2013 is it a ripoff   future shop in canada and best buy u.s. canada offer warranties that are typically 25 of the cost of the product   that 's a huge mark up massive yet to my knowledge they are one of the only retailers that you can walk into the store and just drop it off for exchange   as opposed to buying a 3rd party extended warranty that is considerably less expensive yet it puts the burden on you to mail the product in wait for god knows how long to receive a repaired or new their choice product    it 's a gamble an expensive one yet if you 're spending top dollar on a product would n't you like to have some peace of mind that it will last you at least 2 3 years unfortunately as i mentioned earlier electronics or anything for that matter just are n't as reliable as you 'd hope the xbox 360 gaming console was notorious for being poorly made   in fact many people not only had to take advantage of the extended warranty but had to do so more than 2 3 times so make sure you do your homework on a product before you even think about buying it   what do i do i buy at future shop best buy or staples for the convenience of dropping off the product in the event of an issue   i really do n't want to bother with the hassle of applying for warranty service and long mail in return wait period   if the product is $ 100 or so forget it and just buy it whoever has it cheapest and cross your fingers

no   if the share price drops to $ 0 it 's likely that the company is in bankruptcy usually debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first and you 're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off more often than not equity holders probably wo n't get much to give an example corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization in the us these are called chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy respectively canada and the united kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations although in the uk reorganization is often referred to as administration many countries have similar procedures in place i 'll use the us as an example because it 's what i 'm most familiar with in chapter 7 bankruptcy the company is liquidated to pay its debts investopedia 's article about bankruptcy states during chapter 7 bankruptcy investors are considered especially low on the ladder usually the stock of a company undergoing chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless and investors lose the money they invested if you hold a bond you might receive a fraction of its face value what you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page in chapter 11 bankruptcy the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization the investopedia article quotes the sec to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens during chapter 11 bankruptcy bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments and stockholders stop receiving dividends if you are a bondholder you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds if you are a stockholder the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company the new shares may be fewer in number and worth less the reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive if anything from the company the exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that 's worked out local laws court agreements etc for example in the case of general motor 's bankruptcy stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company

as someone that works in and with the ag and commodity markets my understanding is limited but i hope it helps    aside from needing an infrastructure built to maintain the vast amounts of data communication pricing banking information having a closing time for our markets helps to ensure value and fair trade capitalism is centralized around creating a fair value for ventures to sell where prospective buyers opt to purchase or invest for example where i attended university there were many coffee shops close to campus but only one stayed open all night and as such had operational cost much higher than other shops forcing them to charge more for a cup of coffee while this example is crude the idea is the same by hours product or strategies and developments meant to increase projected value are allowed to occur    i imagine that if the markets did not close my coffee prices would skyrocket for an increased demand that of which the supply and farmers would struggle to meet the same would be said of grain salt oils etcetera

that 's not what he 's saying at all   basically most of his argument 4 of 6 points is the connection between bond prices and equity prices it 's not particularly interesting but it definitely does n't always apply either if bond yields fall then so too should equity earnings yields if spreads remain relatively constant i.e. higher equity prices additionally if bond yields are low then any future equity growth gets capitalized at a much higher value because discount rates are much lower again not particularly insightful   the two interesting comments were about oil and cash as a of assets at financial institutions both of these are likely linked to falling or low rates above because banks ca n't invest profitably at low rates and hence hold cash and equivalents instead and oil prices are more likely to fall in a low or falling inflation environment implied by the low rates or fed tightening   really i think he s 's saying something more obvious but not necessarily trivial which is if one asset class goes up so too is another related one

why not just get a consolidated loan for 15 k and then $ 20 k zero transfer the loan will have a payoff on the amount borrowed probably a fixed payment which would be more than double the payment as if it were only $ 15 k to start that make sense   if you are approved for both pieces of this it should help what is going to be the rate on the loan   the process you are starting has 3 aspects cut spending reduce interest minimize payment obligations if you do anything to earn more even a few hours a week it will add up   i would not reduce any credit lines in a perfect world you will have a buffer of money to cover any expense until then available access to money is important but of course to be used either for emergencies or when cash is there to pay the bill in full when it comes in

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

the whole point of buying puts is cheaper cost and lower downside risk if you short the box you are assuming he already holds gold holdings to short against it 's not the same as short selling where you borrow shares   either way you are far more vulnerable to downside risk if you are short the stock whether you borrowed or shorted already owned shares if gold suddenly has a 20 pop over the next year which could be possible given the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace you have big trouble whereas if you buy puts you only lose your costs for the contracts the amount that you miss by in your bet is n't going to factor into anything

it is a rather complex system but here is a rough summary interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank as a concrete example the bank of england system is the rtgs only the clearing banks and similar e.g. bacs have access to rtgs you can send a chaps payment fairly quickly but that costs chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid   hence its use for large amounts bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up because we are talking about bank reserve movements checks have to be in place and that can take time furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are transactions a layer removed so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day hence the two hour clearing for safety it can only be used for up to 10k second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down foreign currency transfers require the foreign central bank reserve somewhere and so must be by at least one clearing bank in that country different countries are at different stages in their technology   uk clearing is standard now but us is a little behind i believe   much of europe is speeding up rather like bitcoin clearing you have a choice between speed and safety if you wait you are more certain the transaction is sound and have more time to bust the transfer

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

# 549290
i would not advise this for two reasons your point that the investment could be lower at the end of the 3 years is a concern although with a safe investment it is less so but this reduces the potential gain while your interest is not gaining interest your interest charged is based on the principal if you pay off the loans you reduce the principal and therefore you pay less interest in the long run even if the interest is n't capitalized all that this means is that you are basically being charged simple interest as opposed to compounding interest but reducing the principal helps in either case you are mistaken about the benefits of the tax deduction you reduce your tax bill by the marginal rate times the student loan interest you paid for the year so if you are in the 15 tax bracket and paid $ 100 in interest you save $ 15 this is not a reason to keep the loans because you have to pay $ 100 to get $ 15 but you are mistaken on the benefit it has nothing to do with shifting the tax brackets also speaking of taxes do n't forget that you pay taxes on investment gains

lending is not a charitable contribution its an investment if the loan becomes a bad debt you 'll have to show that it had become a bad debt for example bankruptcy declaration you 'll have to show an arm 's length transaction for example real intention to repay evidenced by payments of principal and interest made otherwise if you have an intention for the loan to never be repaid it is in fact a gift which is not only not deductible its taxable bottom line be careful and talk to a ea cpa to get a proper advice with regards to a specific transaction edit to answer your revised question you 're not going to pay taxes if you 're not going to have gains however if you lose the principal in addition to the said above you would incur the loss as a personal bad debt and not business this is because it is not investment the difference is in tax treatment personal bad debt is a short term capital loss limited deduction business is an ordinary loss

one important issue that has yet to be covered is the cost to you in terms of paperwork lost time and phone calls that you have to make to claim the insurance   such insurance claims often are very low priority on their customer service queues for obvious reasons since they have already made the sale therefore you might have to spend up to a few hours of your time calling or writing emails to claim the warranty which may often not be much   therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account    therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account

applying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork but not too bad of an experience rates are pretty tight if one lender were more that 1/4 lower than another they 'd be inundated with applications above a certain credit score you get the best rate a search will show you the rates offered in your area   if you are a first time buyer there are mortgages that might benefit you if you are a vet for non native english readers a veteran who served in the us armed forces not a who is an animal doctor there are mortgages that offer low to no down payment with attractive rates   yes avoid pmi it 's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase if banks qualify you for different amounts it should n't be a huge difference a few percent variation but the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today and getting the most you 'd qualify for is probably too much   using the standard 28/36 ratios a bank will qualify you for 4x your income as a loan e.g you make $ 50 k they 'll lend you $ 200k. this is a bit too much in my opinion   if you come up short you are really looking to borrow too much and should probably wait if you owe a bit on loans it should squeeze in between those two ratios 28/36 but i would n't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase that 's asking for trouble

i can make that election to pay taxes now even though they are n't vested based on the dollar value at the time they are granted that is correct you must file the election with the irs within 30 days after the grant and then attach a copy to that year 's tax return would i not pay any taxes on the gains because i already claimed them as income no you claim income based on the grant value the gains after that are your taxable capital gains the difference is that if you do n't use 83(b election that would not be capital gains but rather ordinary salary income what happens if i quit get terminated after paying taxes on un vested shares do i lose those taxes or do i get it back in a refund next year or would it be a deduction next year you lose these taxes that 's the risk you 're taking generally 83(b election is not very useful for rsus of established public companies you take a large risk of forfeited taxes to save the difference between capital gains and ordinary gains which is not all that much it is very useful when you 're in a startup with valuations growing rapidly but stocks not yet publicly trading which means that if you pay tax on vest you 'll pay much more and wo n't have stocks to sell to cover for that while the amounts you put at risk are relatively small

for example for my employer i received a signing bonus and a    relocation lump sum separate from that signing bonus the relocation    lump sum is taxed and will appear as income on my w-2 and i can spend    it on anything i want that said should the relocation lump sum count    towards the entry quoted above in form or would it be considered    the same as any other bonus thus allowing me to take a full deduction    for all of my deductible travel expenses the signing bonus and relocation lump sum will appear as regular income on your w-2 you can think of the relocation bonus as something to cover the pain and suffering the cost of moving without needing to send in receipts lets assume that you meet the distance and time tests so there is potential to save money on your taxes lets also put your actual moving expenses as $ 2500 if you have valid moving expenses the irs will allow you to use them to reduce your agi so now you can reduce your agi by the $ 2500   enter the total amount your employer paid you for the expenses listed    on lines 1 and 2 that is not included in box 1 of your form w-2    wages this amount should be shown in box 12 of your form w-2 with    code p. my question is what exact payments from your employer should be    entered here i realize that you can just write the number you get in    box 12 with code p on your w-2 but i 'm curious how they come up with    this number in some cases the company will reimburse you your moving expenses up to a maximum of $ x. for example a maximum of $ 1000 that means you submit receipts for those expenses and they give you a check or add it to your next paycheck the check will either be for the amount on your receipts or the maximum amount whichever is smaller in this situation with actual expenses of $ 2500 and a reimbursement of $ 1000 you can reduce your agi by $ 1500

the general argument put forward by gold lovers is n't that you get the same gold per dollar or dollars per ounce of gold but that you get the same consumable product per ounce of gold in other words the claim is that the inflation adjusted price of gold is more or less constant see link for a chart of gold in 2010 gbp all the way from in 2010 gbp means its an inflation adjusted chart as you can see there is plenty of fluctuation in there but it just so happens that gold is worth about the same now as it was in see link for a series of anecdotes of the buying power of gold and silver going back some 3000 years what this means to you if you think the stock market is volatile and want to de risk your holdings for the next 2 years gold is just as risky if you want to invest some wealth such that it will be worth more in real terms when you take it out in 40 years time than today the stock market has historically given better returns than gold if you want to put money aside and it to not lose value for a few hundred years then gold might be a sensible place to store your wealth as per comment from it might be possible to use gold as a partial hedge against the stock market as the two supposedly have very low correlation

in some respects the analysis for this question is similar to comparing a safe return on a government bond vs. holding the stock market typically the stock market 's expected return will be higher i.e. there 's a positive equity risk premium vs. a government bond assuming it 's held to maturity there 's no guarantee that the stock market will outperform although the probability of outperformance rises some analysts argue the longer the holding period for equities beyond say 10 years that 's why there 's generally a positive equity risk premium otherwise no one or relatively few investors would hold equities

even if the price of your home did match inflation or better and that 's a question i 'll let the other answers address i propose that owning a home by itself is not a sufficient hedge against inflation consider inflation will inflate your living expenses if you 're lucky they 'll inflate at the average if you 're unlucky a change in your spending patterns perhaps age related could result in your expenses rising faster than inflation look at the sub indexes of the cpi without income also rising with inflation or better how will you cope with rising living expenses each passing year advancing living expenses risk a static income your home is an illiquid asset generally speaking it neither generates income for you nor can you sell only a portion at best owning your principal residence helps you avoid a rent expense and inflation in rents but rent is only one of many living expenses some consider a reverse mortgage an option to tap home equity but it has a high cost in other words if you do n't want to be forced to liquidate sell your home you 'll also need to look at ways to ensure your income sources rise with inflation i.e. look at your cash flow not just your net worth hence investing in housing as in your own principal residence is not an adequate hedge against inflation if you owned additional properties to generate rental income and you retained pricing power so you could increase the rent charged at least in line with inflation your situation would be somewhat improved except you would perhaps be adopting another problem too high a concentration in a single asset class consequently i would look at ways other than housing to hedge against inflation consider other kinds of investments safe as houses may be a but it is no guarantee

house as investment is not a good idea besides the obvious calculations do n't forget the property tax home maintenance costs and time insurance costs etc there are a lot of hidden drains on the investment value of the house most especially the time that you have to invest in maintaining it on the other hand if you plan on staying in the area having children pets or like do home improvements landscaping gardening auto repair wood metal shopping then a house might be useful to you also consider the housing market where you are this gets a bit more difficult to calculate but if you have a high demand rental market then the house might make sense as an investment if you can rent it out for more than your monthly cost including all of those factors above but being a landlord is not for everyone again more of your time invested into the house you have to be prepared to go months without renting it you may have to deal with crazy people that will totally trash your house and threaten you if you complain and you may need to part with some of the rent to a management company if you need their skills or time it sounds like you are just not that interested right now that 's fine do n't rush invest your money some other way i.e. the stock market more than likely when you are ready for a house or to bail your family out of trouble if that 's what you choose to do you 'll have even more assets to do either with

when we talk about compounding we usually think about interest payments if you have a deposit in a savings account that is earning compound interest then each time an interest payment is made to your account your deposit gets larger and the amount of your next interest payment is larger than the last there are compound interest formulas that you can use to calculate your future earnings using the interest rate and the compounding interval   however your mutual fund is not earning interest so you have to think of it differently when you own a stock and your mutual fund is simply a collection of stocks the value of the stock hopefully grows let 's say for example that you have $ 1000 invested and the value goes up 10 the first year the total value of your investment has increased by $ 100 and your total investment is worth $ 1100 if it grows by another 10 the following year your investment is then $ having gained $ 110   in this way your investment grows in a similar way to compound interest as your investment pays off it causes the value of the investment to grow allowing for even higher earnings in the future so in that sense it is compounding however because it is not earning a fixed predictable amount of interest as a savings account would you ca n't use the compound interest formula to calculate precisely how much you will have in the future as there is no fixed compounding interval   if you want to use the formula to estimate how much you might have in the future you have to make an assumption on the growth of your investment and that growth assumption will have a time period associated with it for example you might assume a growth rate of 10 per year or you might assume a growth rate of 1 per month this is what you could use in a compound interest formula for your mutual fund investment   by reinvesting your dividends and capital gains and not taking them out in cash you are maximizing your compounding by allowing those earnings to cause your investment to grow

yes you can do this yourself   i can not speak for all the credit repair companies but generally they are not reputable   even if they are trustworthy they can not do anything you can not do yourself freeze your credit   lock it down and prevent any new activity   this is for safety and i want you to do it so you know where you stand get a copy of your free copies of the three credit reports from this is the only free official place to get your reports sign up for a free credit score estimation site like http://www creditkarma.com or http://www   these sites make money by selling affiliate offers but you can easily ignore them   you ca n't get your exact fico score but they letter grades they provide help you understand where you stand dispute anything that is not accurate   get wrong items corrected with the credit agency ignore collectors who are not showing up on your report   if they are n't reporting you so what   let your own moral compass be your guide if you pay those debts or not negotiate a payment amount with the debtors you owe   if you are dealing with a debt collector there is n't any point in paying the full amount   you owed the money to somebody else and they sold it to the debt collector therefore in my mind they are as whole as they feel like being   it is up to you how much you pay but you are already going to suffer   and have suffered the credit ramifications   no sense in wasting money when they will very likely settle for dimes on the dollar   do n't let them bully you around   i suggest understand your rights and protections as offered by the fair debt collection practices act before you pay anybody anything get it in writing wait and follow up   make sure they report it correctly i would probably tackle them in order of age newest first    do n't bother with debts that are more than or nearly seven years old   anything that old is or will fall off of the credit report soon and your score will start to rise   paying on those debts will refresh them and they will harm you longer   we can debate the ethics of that advice in the comments but if you want your score to raise i suggest just waiting about anything over six years old while you tackle the newer ones this is a slow process   your credit score will still take a couple years to heal once you fix your report   but that is the point of the score after all   it is a history of how you handle money and debt

first my economics professor would kill me if i did n't point out that lowering the price does n't change demand only quantity demanded there 's a pretty big difference between the two   anyway the answer to your question is it depends   you 're hoping that people who do n't buy your sandwich for the original price will start buying it at the lower price you 're also hoping that once you increase the price they 'll continue to buy it the relationship describing how much a change in price affects the quantity demanded is known as elasticity elastic demand means that small changes will have a big affect on buying decisions inelastic demand means that buyers are not very flexible and will continue to purchase even after a significant price increase theoretically at least   the decision to raise or lower a price is a very complex process with a lot of variables so i do n't think anyone can give you a right answer to your question   practically you need to figure out where these extra customers are coming from if they are n't buying your sandwiches now because there 's a cheaper alternative lowering the price might entice them to buy from you instead however this means that when you raise the price back they 'll likely leave again   if they do n't know about your deli or have n't tried your sandwiches yet a change in price is n't likely to do any good without a strong marketing campaign to back it up   the of your product could also have an effect if your product is subway quality at higher prices no one is going to stick around on the other hand if you lace your sandwiches with crack you might get some repeat customers long term loyalty is key   hopefully this rambling helps you it 's late and i need to sleep good luck

two things you should consider about paying off student loans ahead of the 10 year amortization schedule what interest rate are you paying on your loans what are you earning on your investments in a balanced mutual fund when you pay off your student loans you are essentially guaranteed a return of the interest rate on your loan future interest you would have had to pay however if you are investing well and getting a good return on your investments you will get a greater return ex half of my student loans are at 6.8 other half are at 2.5 i make the minimum payments on the loans at 2.5 and invest my money in tax sheltered retirement accounts the return on these funds has been 8 and that is on per tax dollars so really closer to 11 now there is also downside risk when you invest in the market but 2.5 guaranteed i will for 11 in low risk return however my loans at 6.8 i repay in excess of the minimums because 6.8 guaranteed return is pretty good so this decision is based on your confidence in your investments and your own risk tolerance once you pay your bank on your student loans that money is gone out of your control if you need it in the future you may need to pay higher interest on an unsecured loan or you may not be able to borrow it when you want to make large purchases a car house that money you per paid on your loans is n't available to you as a down payment banks should want you to have some of your own skin in the game on these purchases and the lending standards keep getting tougher you are better off if you have money saved in your name rather than against the balance on your loan yes you ca n't bankrupt these loans but the money you repay on them does n't go toward housing you or paying your bills on a rainy day i went through the same feeling when i completed my mba with $ 50k in debt you want to pay it off as soon as possible but you need to step away and realize that it was an investment in your future and your future is long you need time to make a financial foundation for it and you will feel a lot more empowered when you have money saved and you can make the decision for how you want to deploy it to work for you ex i could pay down my student loans with the balance i have in the bank but i am going to use it to invest in myself and open my own business

a lot of people do this for example in my area nice townhouses go for about $ 400 k so if you have $ 80,000 you can buy one and rent it here are the typical numbers so you would make $ 350 per month or $ per year on $ 80,000 in capital or about 5 profit what can go wrong 1 the property does not rent and sits vacant you must come up with $ 2100 in mortgage payments taxes and insurance every month without fail or default 2 unexpected expenses a new furnaces costs over $ 5,000 a new roof costs $ 7,000 a new appliance costs $ 600 to $ 2000 depending on how upscale your property is i just had a toilet fixed for a leaky it cost me $ 200 as you can see maintenance expenses can quickly get a lot higher than the $ 50 shown above and not only that if you fix things as cheaply as possible as most landlords do not only does that decrease the of the property but it causes stuff to break sooner 3 deadbeats some people will rent your property and then not pay you now you have a property with no income you are spending $ 2100 per month to pay for it and you are facing steep attorney fees to get the deadbeats evicted they can fight you in court for months 4 damage wear and tear whenever a tenant turns over there is always a lot of broken or worn stuff that has to be fixed holes in the wall need to be busted locks broken windows non working toilets stains on the carpet stuck doors ripped screens leaky showers broken tiles painting exterior trim painting walls painting fences etc you can spend thousands every time a tenant changes other caveats banks are much more strict about loaning to non home owners you usually have to have reserve income so if you have little or no income or you are stretched already it will be difficult to get commercial loans for example lets say your take home pay is $ 7,000 and you have no mortgage at all you rent then it is fine the bank will loan you the money but lets say you only have $ 5,000 in take home pay and you have an $ 1,800 mortgage on your own home in that case it is very unlikely a bank will allow you to assume a 2nd mortgage on a rental property the more you try to borrow the more reserve income the bank will require this tends to set a limit on how much you can leverage

gt could you discuss why the lack of restrictions on these subjects would make hedge funds more attractive to wealthy investors as opposed to mutual funds   well just think about it this way    you have two soccer players they both know the game extremely well they both have similar styles of plan and similar strategies they 're very good players    now you change the rules for one of the players he has to wear a 20 pound weight vest on him at all times and can only kick the ball with his right foot when shooting but his left when passing    who do you think would win in a one v. one     mutual funds are offered to the general public most of them anyways which works under certain assumptions about possible investors while investments with these funds are still considered risky the restrictions placed on mutual funds are designed to promote safety of principle for instance mutual funds are restricted in short selling and trading on margin mutual funds must also clearly state what securities they 're going to get into what strategy they 'll follow etc and deviations from this can get them into trouble   hedge funds have no such restrictions therefore they can pursue any type of investment they want hedge funds have invested or tried to invest in everything from stocks to private equity to bitcoin to art to rare to property to contracts to get boats to and from the statue of liberty to water rights to lawsuit settlements to    this relative freedom gives them much more flexibility and thus they can earn above average returns these lack of restrictions also makes them much riskier and additionally the way they 're legally set up means only a specific type of investor called an accredited investor in the u.s. can invest    what does it take to be an accredited investor basically either be rich in income $ 200k a year if single $ 300k if married or be rich in wealth net worth of $ 1mm not counting primary house
