sorry for this late reply   i currently live in iceland i am a united people here told me they thought checks were just something that were in movies i was amazed by this so here are some reasons that i see to being why it works still in the usa 1 social security system most euro nordic countries have their lives bank accounts ect tied to their social security number and that number is not top secret like it is in the usa in fact here in iceland you throw your number around to anyone who wants it because they ca nt do anything with it but pay you money really 2 banks in the usa there are millions millions of small town banks that means that doing direct deposits or transfers is much much harder to achieve example iceland has two banks the most common way of loaning a friend money or paying for that hotel room if you forgot to bring cash or your card is to say give me your ssn and i will transfer to you it takes about 30 seconds to do a funds transfer in the usa you ca n't do that they would think you are lying or not want to give they bank info or because of the fees from small town banks it would be pointless also a lot of these small banks will not accept direct deposit i had a bank growing up that still does not these are some of the main reasons that i think cause the flow of checks in the usa

from a canadian point of view i think we are generally very similar to how you describe austria   the only thing i use cash for is to pay for my coffee at a local micro who only accepts cash   cheques i only use to pay friends   everything else is debit or credit card   very few businesses around here will even accept cheques anymore

there are some people that still get an old fashioned paycheck but for the most part if you are an employee at a company you get a paystub while the money is direct deposited into your accounts   paying for stuff at a store with a check is not very common   most people use credit cards for that purpose   a significant percentage of the population still use checks for paying there regular bills through the mail   although the more internet savvy people will most likely use online bill pay from their bank so they do n't have to mail checks   personally i have only written about 15 checks in 5 years   mostly to people and not to businesses setup for receiving bill payments electronically

a very interesting topic as i am moving to the us in a month i realise this thread is old but its been helpful to me   my observations from my home country   before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day who expect to work for a different person each day or week   well here a contractor would still be paid by a direct deposit even if he was working for many different people on the invoice the contractor provides bank account details and customer logs onto their internet banking and pays electronically it is a a very simple process and is the preferred method of payment by most businesses even small contractors many accounting software programs are linked to bank accounts and can quickly reconcile accounts for small business many businesses will not accept a cheque in australia anymore as they are considered to be a higher risk   i started work in 1994 and have never received any payment except via direct deposit

i know this an old thread but one that caught my interest as i just moved to the usa from australia as per the op i had never written a check in my whole life and upon arriving in the us i was surprised as to their in australia pretty much all bills you receive can be paid in a number of ways   for small amounts between friends cash is probably used most but for larger amounts direct transfer is popular your friend landlord will give you their bank account number and number which identifies their bank and then you transfer the money in we do n't have a ssn like some other countries cheques are still used by some however esp by the older generations now that i 'm in the us initially i had tried to set up direct transfer to pay my rent however the bank has a $ 1000 daily transfer limit i contacted the bank to get this increased however i was informed that this limit applies to all accounts at the bank i asked how do people pay their rents with this low limit and was told that most people used cheques this explains the strange look i got from my landlord when i asked for their bank account details so i could pay the rent i now have some bills to pay here and i use online banking you enter the biller 's name and address and then the bank actually prints off a cheque and posts it to the biller on your behalf my first couple of pays here were also cheques which were the first actual paychecks i had ever received
# 381813
i receive checks from my tenant also from our medical reimbursement account i 'm sure there 's an option somewhere to get that direct deposited just have n't yet my wife will write checks for school functions funny they have n't cashed one since february and this is the one item to look for every time i reconcile her account a few select others do n't take credit or debit cards our tailor losing weight needed pants pulled in among others the number of checks is surely down an order of magnitude over the years but still not zero
# 219033
it is possible to not use checks in the us i personally use a credit card for almost everything and often have no cash in my wallet at all i never carry checks with me if we wanted to we could pay all of our monthly bills without checks as well and many people do this 30 years ago grocery stores did n't generally accept credit cards so it was cash or check though most other kinds of stores and restaurants did now the only stores that i have encountered in years that do not accept credit cards are a local chicken restaurant and the warehouse shopping store costco costco accepts its own credit card but not mastercard or visa still we do pay the majority of our monthly bills via check and it would not be shocking to see someone paying for groceries with a check i ca n't name the last time i saw someone write a check at a store exactly but i 've never seen any cashier or other patrons wonder what a check writer was trying to do large transactions like buying a car or house would still use checks probably cashier 's or certified checks and not personal checks though

when you start at a new job here in the u.s. the default means of payment is usually a paper check most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check   even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies a counter example is a self employed contractor perhaps a carpenter or house painter   these folks are paid by their customers homeowners and such   many larger well established now accept credit card payments from customers but smaller may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments   3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins   in such cases these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments there are a few folks here who do n't trust direct deposit or more specifically do n't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time   some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account in my experience the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash   they may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash i operate in a manner similar to you i use a debit card or credit card i only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life i use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage and i receive my paycheck by direct deposit   there have been periods where i have n't written or received paper checks for so long that i have to hunt for where i put my checkbook even though i use a debit card for most store purchases the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank   again the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc   direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week i do n't think this is all that unique to the us   there are people in every city and country who do n't have long term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments    i 'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet actually

in my business estate planning law practice probably 60 70 of my income is in the form of checks with the balance as credit debit cards i prefer to get paid by check so i do n't have to pay the approx 2.5 merchant fee but i do n't push clients to choose one method over the other i offer direct deposit to my employees but most of them choose to be paid by check also check processing is becoming more and more electronic when i get paid by check i scan the checks in a dedicated desktop scanner and upload the check images to the bank at the end of the day and the checks are processed very quickly i also make deposits to my personal credit union account by scanning checks and uploading the images   so yes there 's technically a paper check but i as the merchant recipient depositor keep the check for a few months to make sure there 's no problem with the deposit payment then shred them the bank never sees the actual paper check
# 199069
i still use checks to pay rent and occasionally some bills liabilities that said i did notice an elderly lady paying by check at the supermarket a while ago so is it really common to get a paycheck in the sense that you get a piece of paper yes and no   there are some people that opt for the physical paycheck   even if they do not there is a pay stub which serves as a record of it   my last employer went to online pay stubs and a bunch of us opted out sticking with the good old paper in an envelope   we sure were glad of that when there were technical issues and security concerns with the online service
# 494783
typically your paychecks are direct deposited into your bank account and you receive a paycheck stub telling you how much of your money went where taxes insurance 401k etc most people use debit or credit cards for purchases   i personally only use checks to transfer money to another person family friend etc than a business   and even then there 's paypal

buy and sell orders always include the price at which you buy sell that 's how the market prices for stocks are determines so if you want to place a buy order at 106 you can do that when that order was fulfilled and you have the stock you can place a sell order at 107 it will be processed as soon as someone places a buy order at 107 theoretically you can even place sell orders for stocks you have n't even bought yet that 's called short selling you do that when you expect a stock to go down in the future but this is a very risky operation because when you the market you might end up owing more money than you invested no responsible banker will even discuss this with you when you can not prove you know what you are doing

the reason people buy earthquake insurance is not because normal insurance goes straight to the lender it does not but because oftentimes earthquake damage is not covered under normal homeowner 's insurance natural disasters are often not covered under regular insurance this is why people buy flood insurance if your pipes burst and flood your house your home owner 's insurance will typically cover if the local river floods and floods your house oftentimes insurance will not cover this is why a lot of state federal agencies have separate pools of insurance all earthquake insurance in california is technically through the state agency though you may go through your homeowner provider to get it i pay $ 200 a year for mine i would n't say it 's very expensive my concern is not a giant earthquake that destroys my house my concern is a large earthquake that might cause cracks in my slab or structural damage that my regular insurance is in no way obligated to cover but i need to fix i think if you live in an earthquake prone area it 's as reasonable as getting flood insurance if you live in an area known to flood

what is the formula for calculating the total cost of a loan with extra payments towards the principal the formula you require is the standard one for calculating the time to repay   with larger repayments the time to completely repay the loan is reduced where the total cost of the loan is then n d. explanation calculation the formula for a loan is derived from the sum of the cash flows discounted to present value being equal to the principal   for further info see the section here titled calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity the summation can be reduced to a closed form by induction   rearranging for d and n with the op 's figures the original monthly repayment is $ adding $ 200 each month with the higher repayment the loan is repaid in months instead of 360   of course a bank would simply take a reduced payment in month but the amounts work out the same the saving is $ addendum if the repayments increase was made part way through the term of the loan the summation and formula would be   where then for example if for the first ten years the payments are $ and for the remaining time the repayments are $ the loan is completely repaid in months the saving is plotting over a range of m months

andrew has a likely scenario for when greece defaults on its sovereign debt what happens when greece defaults    here are a few things every bank in greece will instantly go insolvent the greek government will every bank in greece the greek government will forbid withdrawals from greek banks to prevent greek depositors from rioting on the streets    when the    president had to flee by    helicopter from the roof of the    presidential to evade a mob of    such depositors the greek government    will declare a perhaps even    general martial law greece will all its debts into new drachmas or whatever    it calls the new currency this is a    classic ploy of countries defaulting the new drachma will devalue by some 30 70 per cent probably around 50 per    cent though perhaps more    effectively defaulting 50 per cent    or more of all greek euro denominated    debts as says there 's more at the link all depressing i think you 're focusing too much on greece leaving the euro and not enough on why greece would leave the euro greece would leave the euro precisely so that it could pay back its debt in a new currency worth less than valuable euros the new currency will devalue since that 's the point of leaving along the way the government forces its citizens to take the new currency the money they have in greek banks will be converted to the new currency the citizens do n't have a choice to keep their euros

one scenario described in the original question a non insider who trades after informal conversations with friends where no insiders directly benefit from any such disclosure might not be illegal   ianal this is just my personal interpretation of articles in the news recently the appeals court said prosecutors needed to show that the person disclosing the information received a clear benefit something more than the nurturing of a friendship in a 1980 case the supreme court rejected the idea of a general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material nonpublic information

is it a smart thing for an entry level employee with a basic pay to buy a property on debt this is opinion based and ca n't be answered by others only you can make the choice their reasoning is that since i am paying for their house rent right have been doing this ever since i got into graduate school i could divert it to pay for the loan while getting a property in return if i understand this you are currently nri as you are working in japan you would like to take a home loan in india and buy a property in india   in the current scenario the emi towards home loan do not equate to the rent as property prices have gone up in most places in 2002 2007 there was a time of low interest rates and low property prices that along with tax breaks made it cheaper to buy than rent also note that since you are nri you do not get any income tax rebate on interest paid if you buy please ensure that all the emi 's are paid from nre account this would in future help you repatriate funds out of india if you plan to sell the house but i am scared of getting into debt so early in my career if i commit myself like that it might make me less in making career changes till i finish paying off that debt this is a valid concern if you need to pursue further studies or take a break for a change in career it would make it difficult also note there are additional costs of buying a house apart from emi there property tax if you staying in society a monthly maintenance etc

the stock market exists for two reasons it lets companies raise money to invest and it lets company owners cash out and get money instead of part ownership of a company when they are ready to do so but to accomplish these goals effectively it needs many more transactions than just those kinds of transaction because you have to be able to find a buyer when you need one and to have a market price so there are also a lot of transactions that are just to try to make short term profit but we need those transactions to provide the market liquidity to let the stock market work properly for its actual purposes

everything that i 'm saying presumes that you 're young and wo n't need your money back for 20 + years and that you 're going to invest additional money in the future your first investments should never be individual stocks that is far too risky until you have a lot more experience in the market once you absolutely ca n't resist keep it to under 5 of your total investments that lets you experiment without damaging your returns too much instead you would want to invest in one or more mutual funds of some sort which spreads out your investment across many companies with only $ 50 avoiding a trading commission is paramount if you were in the us i would recommend opening a free online brokerage account and then purchasing a no load commission free mutual fund td ameritrade for example publishes a list of the funds that you can purchase without commission the lists generally include the type of fund index growth value etc and its record of return i do n't know if europe has the same kind of discount brokerages mutual funds the us has but i 'd be a little surprised if it did n't you may or may not be able to invest until you first scrape together a $ 500 minimum but the brokerages often have special programs accounts for people just starting out it should be possible to ask one more thing on picking a fund most charge about a 1 annual expense ratio that means that a $ 100 investment that had a 100 gain after one year would net you $ instead of $ 200 because 1 of the value of your asset $ 200 is $ 2 the math is much more complicated and depends on the value of your investment at every given point during the year but that 's the basic idea however there are index funds that track the market automatically and they can have much lower expense fees 0.05 vs 1 for the same quality of performance over 40 years the expense ratio can have a surprisingly large impact on your net return even 20 or more you 'll want to google separately about the right way to pick a low expense index fund your online brokerage may also be able to help finally ask friends or family what mutual funds they 've invested in how they chose those funds and what their experience has been the point is not to have them tell you what to do but for you to learn from the mistakes and successes of other experienced investors with whom you can follow up

the cost will be around $ if you do it correctly it in florida and can be over a $ 1,000 if you do it in new york new york is more expensive due to a publication requirement that new york has for llc ’s   the price ranges i ’ve given include filing state fees getting a tax id number ein operating agreement membership certificates registered agent fees and publication fees if done in new york each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there yearly paperwork to keep the llc running wo n’t be so expensive expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted   i had a quick look at florida and with someone filing it for you expect around $ 200 to $ 250 a year plus registered agent fees   if you are late in florida the penalty is $ 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees in regards to bookkeeping and taxes yearly tax filing will start at $ 250 to $ 500 for an llc and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work   i recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $ 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an llc   i think $ 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are   i know in some major cities expect $ 75 an hour or higher so the expectation in miami and manhattan will probably be more expensive than and if you doing a little business do n’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping so breakdown $ fl $ 1,000 ny registration of llc + any business license city or other registrations $ 250 yearly fee + yearly registered agent + any business licenses city or other fee $ 500 tax return + bookkeeping fee banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $ 120 a year plus in regards to service i would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up   businesses in the us because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with us clients you are going to have some different needs based on not having a social security number or establishing from overseas

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

i 'm not sure about your first two options   but given your situation a variant of option three seems possible    that way you do n't have to throw away your appraisal although it 's possible that you 'll need to get some kind of addendum related to the repairs    you also do n't have your liquid money tied up long term   you just need to float it for a month or two while the repairs are being done   the bank should be able to you for the loan    note that you might be better off without the loan   you 'll have to pay interest on the loan and there 's extra red tape    i 'd just prefer not to tie up so much money in this property    i do n't understand this   with a loan you are even more tied up   anything you do you have to work with the bank   sure you have $ 80k more cash available with the loan but it does n't sound like you need it   with the loan the bank makes the profit   if you buy in cash you lose your interest from the cash but you save paying the interest on the loan   in general the interest rate on the loan will be higher than the return on the cash equivalent    a fourth option would be to pay the $ 15k up front as earnest money   the seller does the repairs through your chosen contractor   you pay the remaining $ 12.5k for the downpayment and buy the house with the loan   this is a more complicated purchase contract though so cash might be a better option    you can easily evaluate the difficulty of the second option   call a different bank and ask   if you explain the situation they 'll let you know if they can use the existing appraisal or not   also consider asking the appraiser if there are specific banks that will accept the appraisal   that might be quicker than randomly choosing banks    it may be that your current bank just is n't used to investment properties   requiring the previous owner to do repairs prior to sale is very common in residential properties   it sounds like the loan officer is trying to use the rules for residential for your investment purchase   a different bank may be more inclined to work with you for your actual purchase

were you thinking of an annuity they guarantee regular payments usually after retirement in any case every investment has counterparty risk bonds guarantee payout but the issuer could always default this is why treasury bonds have the lowest yields the treasury is the world 's most trusted borrower it 's also why junk bonds have higher yields than investment grade and partially why longer duration bonds have higher yields as mentioned there 's bank accounts which gain interest and are insured by fdic up to $ 250,000 if the bank folds they 'll be acquired by another and your account balance will simply transfer similar to bank accounts are money market funds these are funds that purchase very short term paper basically < 90 day bonds they maintain a share price of $ 1 and pay interest in the form of additional shares these have the risk of breaking the buck where they need to sell assets at a loss to meet investor withdrawal demands and nav drops below $ 1.00 fortunately that 's a super rare but still definitely possible finally there 's one guy i 've seen on tv pitching a no risk high yield investment i ca n't remember the firm but i am waiting to see them shut down for running a ponzi scheme

see and the articles linked from it the issue with holding a levered etf past 1 day is that investors expose themselves to path dependency in the underlying the reason for the difference in payouts comes from the fact that the manager of the levered etf promises you a multiple of the daily returns of the underlying to be able to promise you these daily returns the etf manager has to buy sell some of the underlying every day to position himself to have a constant leverage ratio the next day the short video below explains this process in detail for a 2x long etf but the same result holds for a 2x short etf the manager has to buy more of the underlying on a day when the underlying increases in value and sell more of the underlying when the underlying goes down in value

alright irs publication 463 travel entertainment gift and car expenses business and personal use if you use your    car for both business and personal purposes    you must divide your expenses between business    and personal use you can divide your expense    based on the miles driven for each purpose example you are a sales representative    for a clothing firm and drive your car 20,000    miles during the year 12,000 miles for business    and 8,000 miles for personal use you can    claim only 60 12,000 ÷ 20,000 of the cost of    operating your car as a business expense obviously nothing helpful in the code   so i would use option 1 weight the maintenance related mileage by the proportion of business use   although if you use your car for business a lot and perhaps have a spouse with a car an argument could be made for 3   so i would consider my odds of being audited even lower this year due to irs budget cuts and choose 1 or 3 and of course never throw anything away until you 're room temperature

gt;so i would like to ask you which at this project poor management skill of oracle staffs or plan of oregon are worse to be accused   i believe there is an increased burden on the employer oregon to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor oracle is working   otherwise the contractor has plausible for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution   gt;or do you think that plan was made mainly by oracle   i think the plan was mostly made by oracle with the requirements given by oregon and that 's where things seem messy   my gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that the contractor of indirect or direct damages that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues   oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses   if there is anything that oregon may have traction on it would be a few of their fraud claims given that oracle has made two wiki with federal agencies of ~$100 amp ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims   such claims by oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to oregon but that blame might go back to oregon 's specifications which i have no insight into   as someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public amp private entities my hope out of all of this is that   sales people for contractors think twice before over promising technology solutions that their company ca n't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications   employers hiring such entities manage them expectations plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability amp responsibility   i think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project developing the systems or running them

some of the other answers mention this but i want to highlight it with a personal anecdote i have a property in a mid sized college town in the us its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago but i do n't care at all because i will likely never sell it that house is worth about $ 110,000 but rents for $ 1500 per month it is a good investment if you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good i have n't mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as that 's fairly us specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money so there are tax advantages as well at least currently those laws also change over time there is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential trendy vacation tourist areas etc each has their place but ensure that you do n't confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general

what is my best bet with the 401 k i know very little about retirement    plans and do n't plan to ever touch this money until i retire but could    this money be of better use somewhere else if you do n't know your options i would suggest reading some material on it that might be a little more extensive than an answer here for instance has some good and free information about a myriad of financial topics   with retirement accounts you can roll it over or leave it in the current account   things to look at would be costs of the accounts options you have in each account and the flexibility of moving it if you need to   depending on what type of retirement account it is roth 401 k traditional 401 k etc you may have some advantages with moving it to another type the student loans pay them off in one shot i have the extra money    and it would not be a hardship to do so unless that money can be best    used somewhere else unless i was making more money in a savings investing business opportunity i would pay off the student loans in a lump sum   the reason is basic opportunity cost economics if a better opportunity is n't on the horizon with your money kill the interest you 're paying because it 's money you 're losing every month with the money just sitting in the bank i get a little sick feeling    thinking that i can be doing something better with that outside of general savings you could look at investing in stocks etfs mutual funds currencies lending club loans vary by state or something similar   or you could try to start a business or invest in a start up directly though depending on the start up they may not accept small investors   otherwise if you do n't have a specific idea at this time it 's best to have money in savings while you ponder where else it would serve you keep in mind having cash on hand even if it 's not earning anything can bail you out in emergencies or open the door if an opportunity arises   so you 're really not losing anything by having it in cash if you 're patiently waiting on opportunities

something you might want to consider instead of going out bargain hunting in hopes of picking something up on the cheap is to start doing you research now for a stock you would like to have in your portfolio and watch it for news that might cause it to go down before picking it up when it is down for a bit as you pointed out with the bp stock prior to the incident it was a solid stock that was being held in a number of funds by identifying solid stocks now you can also make the decision on the basis of the news to if the fundamentals under the stock are severely impacted or if it just a temporary dip in prices also you might want to index funds such as vti that are tied to the overall market and also pay dividends when the market tends down for awhile you can buy some shares that you can either hold for dollar cost averaging or sell off again once the market picks up

the trade off seems to be quite simple how much are you going to get if you sell it against how much are you going to get if you rent it out several people already hinted that the rental revenue may be optimistic i do n't have anything to add to this but keep in mind that if someone pays 45k for your apartment the net gains for you will likely be lower as well another consideration would be that the value of your apartment can change if you expect it to rise steadily you may want to think twice before selling now assuming you have calculated your numbers properly and a near 0 opportunity cost 45,000 right now per year the given numbers imply a return on investment of 14 years or 7.1 personal conclusion i would be surprised if you can actually get a expected net profit for an apartment that rents out at 6k per year but if you are confident the reward seems to be quite nice

not insulting your part of scotland but that is exactly what happened in detroit and the surrounding area it used to be one of the richest iirc the richest metro area in the us now look at it those who say the unions had nothing to do with it just have to look at what is happening   the us has states called right to work states this is where union membership is not mandatory caterpillar is based in illinois but just moved a factory from japan back to the us illinois was nt even in the running for it they were all southern states that are right to work   you also have to look where foreign manufacturers build things toyota honda vw bmw mitsubishi etc etc all manufacture in southern right to work states they still have unions but they have less power because a lot of people chose not to be in them and pay the dues    in my opinion the people working at the new cat factory are probably happy the plant moved from japan to their town also all of the people working at all of those plants are glad to have their jobs instead of being unemployed    i see these massive union protections northern states and european countries have as a negative i think the fact manufacturers almost exclusively choose right to work states for new factories only reinforces this

and what exactly do i profit from the short i understand it is the difference in the value of the stock so if my initial investment was $ 4000 200 $ 20 and i bought it at $ 3800 200 $ 19 i profit from the difference which is $ 200 do i also receive back the extra $ 2000 i gave the bank to perform the trade either this is extremely poorly worded or you misunderstand the mechanics of a short position   when you open a short position your are expecting that the stock will decline from here   in a short position you are borrowing shares you do n't own and selling them   if the price goes down you get to buy the same shares back for less money and return them to the person you borrowed from   your profit is the delta between the original sell price and the new lower buy price less commissions and fees interest   opening and closing a short position is two trades a sell then a buy   just like a long trade there is no maximum holding period if you place your order to sell short 200 shares at $ 19 your initial investment is $    in order to open your $ short position your broker may require your account to have at least $ according to the 1.5 ratio in your question   it 's not advisable to open a short position this close to the ratio requirement   most brokers require a buffer in your account in case the stock goes up because in a short trade if the stock goes up you 're losing money   if the stock goes up such that you 've exhausted your buffer you 'll receive what 's known as a margin call where your broker either requires you to wire in more money or sell part or all of your position at a loss to avoid further losses   and remember you may be charged interest on the value of the shares you 're borrowing when you hold a position long your maximum loss is the money you put in a position can only fall to zero though you may owe interest or other fees if you 're trading on margin   when you hold a position short your maximum loss is unlimited there 's no limit to how high the value of something can go   there are less risky ways to make short trades by using put options but you should ensure that you have a firm grasp on what 's happening before you use real money the timing of the trades and execution of the trades is no different than when you take a plain vanilla long position   you place your order either market or limit or whatever and it executes when your trade criteria occurs

sometimes i think a question like this is one of moral versus legal   the reality is that you know you owe the money because you received the services   you 're right that the bill should have been sent to you and the natural urge for many people is to just count it in the win column when things like this happen and there 's the chance to avoid paying i suppose my question for you is are you comfortable with the notion that you are not paying something that your heart of hearts tells you should be paid   if roles were reversed and you as a business owner had forgotten to bill something for which you were rightfully due payment would n't you hope they 'd have the integrity to pay you anyway the legal side of this can be a bit trickier and much depends on the state you 're in assuming you 're in the u.s. because some have consumer collection and protection laws than others   the rehab center could when doing an audit of its accounts discover that you did n't pay for these   they could take the polite course of action and call you with a gentle reminder or send a bill or they could be not so nice about it   either way they ca n't send anything to collections for which you have n't been presented a bill and demonstrated an unwillingness to pay   there 's a process in place regardless of the state so they ca n't just automatically put it into collections i will close with this question for you did the rehab center help you with what you needed and are you healthier and better because of their care   if so pay the bill   that 's my advice   keep in mind that unpaid medical costs just raise the prices for everyone else because these providers will make up for the loss somewhere i hope this helps good luck

taxes   based on the numbers you quoted it does n't appear that you would have a taxable event if you sell all the shares in the account   if you only sell some of the shares to fund the new account you should specify which shares you want to sell if you sell only the shares that you bought when share prices were high then every share you sell could be considered a loss this will increase your losses these losses can be deducted from your taxes though there are limits fees make sure that you understand the fee structure some fund families look at the balance of all your accounts to determine your fee level others treat each fund separately   procedure if you were able to get the 10 k into the new account in the next few months i would advise not selling the shares because it will be 6 to 18 months before you are able to contribute the new funds then rebalancing by selling shares makes more sense it gets you to your goal quicker   all the funds you mentioned have low expense ratios i would n't move funds just to chase a the lowest expense ratio i would look at the steps necessary to get the mix you want in the next few weeks and then what will be needed moving forward if the 60/40 or split makes you comfortable pick one of them if you want to be able to control the balance via rebalancing or changing your contribution percentage then go with two funds

i agree that high volatility just means the underlying stock price fluctuates more and it does not imply if the stock is going up or down but a high volatility in the price of an underlying also means that there is a higher chance that the underlying price could reach extreme prices albeit in either direction however if you purchased a call option then if the underlying price reached an extremely high value then you will be rewarded but if the underlying price reached an extremely low value you wo n't lose any more than the initial premium that you paid there is no additional risk on your side it 's capped to the premium that you paid for the call option it 's this asymmetric outcome heads i win tails i do n't lose combined with high volatility that means that call options will increase in value when the underlying price becomes more volatile if the optionality was n't there then the price would n't be related to the volatility of the underlying but that would be called a future or a forward

this depends in part on who officially owns the account federally 529 plan contributions are not tax deductible regardless of ownership   anyone can contribute to a 529 plan though the earnings of the 529 plan are tax deferred and are tax free if they are used for qualified educational expenses in the state of new york the account owner is entitled to deduct up to 10,000 married filing jointly from their state taxes however that 's limited to the account owner only   if they 're not in the state of new york they may be able to have similar benefits from their home state check their rules you may have multiple accounts for one child though so if you and they both want to contribute for your child that 's perfectly fine the limits are at the taxpayer level so you can deduct $ 10k for all contributions to all children 's accounts in sum 5k per kid if you have 2 and want to contribute equally for example but they can do the same gift tax is the other relevant thing to consider   you can contribute $ 14k per year without either paying gift tax or adding it to the lifetime maximum which is currently $ but could change at any time either up or down   you can also make a one time contribution of 70k 5 years worth and have that amount exempt as if it were contributed over five years for more information on all of this see the new york 529 page for more details

the mutual fund is legally its own company that you 're investing in with its own expenses mutual fund expense ratios are a calculated value not a promise that you 'll pay a certain percentage on a particular day that is to say at the end of their fiscal year a fund will total up how much it spent on administration and divide it by the total assets under management to calculate what the expense ratio is for that year and publish it in the annual report but you ca n't just pay the fee for any given year in a regular account you certainly could look at what expenses were paid for each fund by multiplying the expense ratio by your investment and use it in some way to figure out how much additional you want to contribute to make it whole again but it makes about as much sense as trying to pay the commission for buying a single stock out of one checking account while paying for the share price out of another it may help you in some sort of mental accounting of expenses but since it 's all your money and the expenses are all part of what you 're paying to be able to invest it 's not really doing much good since money is fungible in a retirement account with contribution limits it still does n't really make sense since any contribution from outside funds to try to pay for expense ratios would be counted as contributions like any other again i guess it could somehow help you account for how much money you wanted to contribute in a year but i 'm not really sure it would help you much some funds or brokerages do have non expense ratio based fees and in some cases you can pay for those from outside the account and there are a couple cases where for a retirement account this lets you keep your contributions invested while paying for fees from outside funds this may be the kind of thing that your coworker was referring to though it 's hard to tell exactly from your description usually it 's best just to have investments with as low fees as possible regardless since they 're one of the biggest drags on returns and i 'd be very wary of any brokerage based fees when there are very cheap and free mutual fund brokerages out there

the other answers here do an excellent job of laying out the mathematics of the expected value here is a different take on the question of whether lottery tickets are a sensible investment i used to have the snobbish attitude that many mathematically literate people have towards lotteries that they are a tax on the mathematically illiterate and so on as i 've gotten older i 've realized that though yes it is certainly true that humans are bad at estimating risks that people actually are surprisingly rational when they spend their money what then is the rational basis for buying lottery tickets beyond the standard explanation of it 's cheap entertainment suppose you are a deeply poor person in america your substandard education prepared you for a job in manufacturing which no longer exists you 're working several minimum wage jobs just to keep food on the table and you 're one fall off a ladder from medical expense induced total financial disaster   now suppose you have things that you would like to spend truly enormous amounts of money on like say sending your children to schools with ever increasing tuitions or a home in a safe neighbourhood   buying lottery tickets is a bad investment sure name another legal investment strategy that has a million dollar payout that is accessible to the poor in america even if you could invest 10 of your minimum wage salary without missing the electricity bill that 's still not going to add up to a million bucks in your lifetime probably not even $ 100k.   when given a choice between no chance whatsoever at achieving your goals and a cheap chance that is literally a one in a million chance at achieving your goals the rational choice is to take the bad investment option over no investment at all

yes bond funds are marked to market so they will decline as the composition of their holdings will households actually have relative levels of credit to equity holdings   the reason why is because there is little return on credit making it irrational to hold any amount greater than to fund future liquidity needs risk adjusted and time discounted the vast majority of credit is held by insurance companies   pension funds have large stakes as well   banks hold even fewer bonds since they try to sell them as soon as they 've made them insurance companies are forced to hold a large percentage of their floats in credit then preferred equity   while this their returns it 's not a large problem for them because they typically hold bonds until maturity   only the ones who the risk of insurance will have to sell at unfavorable prices being able to predict interest rates thus bond prices accurately would make one the best bond manager in the world   while it does look like inflation will rise again soon just as it has during every other us expansion can it be assured when commodity prices are high in real terms and look like they may be in a collapse   the banking industry would have to produce credit at a much higher rate to counter the deflation of all physical goods households typically shun assets at low prices to pursue others at high prices so their holdings of bonds etfs should be expected to decline during a bond collapse   if insurance companies find it less costly to hold etfs then they will contribute to an increase in bond etf supply

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

the value will certainly fluctuate up and down but on average gain more than a savings account but so long as you have enough liquid assets for emergencies then yes it 's a perfectly good alternative to savings accounts how risky in general are index income funds how are you defining risk if you mean probability that i 'll lose it all then it 's virtually zero   if you mean how much the value can fluctuate then it 's certainly not risk free but it has less volatility that individual stocks   if you take the s&p 500 as a proxy you might expect the change in value over any given year to fluctuate between -30 like 2008 and + 40 with an average change of around 8 there will be funds that have less volatility but produce less return and funds that have more volatility but higher average returns

i assume the op is the us and that he is like most people a cash basis tax payer and not an accrual basis tax payer suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was reported   as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms but the corresponding income   tax was not withheld   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 nor is the company entitled to withhold tax on this income for 2010 and 2011 at this time the tax on that income has already been paid by the op directly to the irs and the company has nothing to do with the matter anymore suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was not reported as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 should the op have declared the value of the rental of the unit as additional income from his employer that was not reported on the w-2 form and paid taxes   on that money possibly but it would be reasonable to argue that the op did nothing wrong other than not checking his w-2 form carefully he simply assumed the income numbers included the value of the rental and copied whatever the company issued w-2 form said onto his 1040 form at least as   of now there is no reason for the irs to question his 2010 and 2011 returns because the numbers reported to the irs on copy a of the w-2 forms match the numbers reported by the op on his tax returns     my guess is that the company discovered that it had not actually declared the value of the rental payments on the op 's w-2 forms for 2010 and 2011 and now wants to include this amount as income on subsequent w-2 forms now reporting a lump sum benefit of $ 38 k but no actual cash   would have caused a huge amount of income tax to need to be withheld and the op 's next couple of paychecks might well have had zero take home pay as all the money was going towards this tax withholding instead the company is saying that it will report the $ 38 k as income in 78 equal installments weekly paychecks over 18 months   and withhold $ 150 as the tax due on each installment if it does not already do so it will likely also include the value of the current rent as a benefit and withhold tax on that too so the op 's take home pay will reduce by $ 150 at least and maybe more if the current rental payments also start appearing on the paychecks and tax is withheld from them too i will not express an opinion on the legality of the company withholding an additional $ 150 as tax from the op 's paycheck but will suggest that the solution proposed by the company have the money appear as taxable benefits over a period have tax withheld and declare the income on your   2012 2013 and 2014 returns is far more beneficial to the op than the company declaring to the irs that it made a   mistake on the 2010 and 2011 w-2 's issued to the op and that the actual income paid was higher not only will the op have to file amended returns for 2010 and 2011 but the company will need to amend its tax returns too in summary the op needs to know that he will have to pay taxes on the value of the waived rental payments    for 2010 and 2011 the company 's mistake in not declaring this as income to the op    for 2010 and 2011 does not absolve him of the responsibility    for paying the taxes what the company is proposing is a very reasonable solution to the    problem of recovering from the mistake the alternative as points out is to amend    your 2010 and 2011 federal and state tax returns to declare the    value of the rental during those years as additional income    and pay taxes and possibly penalties on the additional    amount due this takes the company completely out of the picture    but does require a lot more work and a lot more cash now rather    than in the future

ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

this may not be entirely scientific but as a landlord my usual approach is just to do a search for rental properties on craigslist for comparable homes in the neighborhood there are all kinds of formulas professional property managers use but in the end these listings are the ones you are going to be competing with for tenants also it is n't super accurate but online services like can give you some numbers for rental houses that include those that are n't currently advertising

from some background reading i 'm doing it sounds like the union has people by the proverbial balls anyway even in an agency shop where union membership is optional non members must pay for the collective bargaining done by the union and union shop just means that the employer can hire anybody but they must join the union in order to be employed all of those seem to indicate that every worker in the represented class must accept the terms of the collective bargaining wiki   part of the reason that i 'm curious is that once i 've decided that i 'm done being an engineer i think it might be fun to teach but every time i hear about union negotiations it makes me think that operating in that system would be lame going from a world where merit is the primary differentiator to a world where years in the system count for more would kinda suck

of course the situation for each student will vary widely so you 'll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation now that the disclaimer is out of the way the best choice would be to use the unsubsidized stafford loan to finance graduate school if you need to resort to loans the major benefits to the unsubsidized stafford are the following you 'll be forced to consider other loan types due to the unsubsidized stafford loan 's established limits on how much you can borrow per year and in aggregate the borrowing limits are also adjustable down by your institution the plus loan is a fallback loan program designed to be your last resort the program was created as a way for parents to borrow money for their college attending children when all other forms of financing have been exhausted as a result you have the following major disadvantages to using the plus loan you do have the bonus of being able to borrow up to 100 of your educational costs without any limits per year or in aggregate the major benefit of keeping your loans in the direct loan program is predictability many private student loans are variable interest rate loans which can result in higher payments during the course of the loan private loans are also not eligible for government loan forgiveness programs such as for working in a non profit for 10 years

no it is not true it depends on the market the banks inventory the original debt that was owed etc etc the banks generally want to recover their money so in case of underwater properties they may end up hold a property for years until prices bounce back as it happened during the last crisis when many houses were for months years until banks put them back on the market hoping to sell at a price that would allow them to recover their losses

once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the irs cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account the taxes due will be based on your mom 's tax rate as a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf also legally that money currently belongs to her any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such a better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name this way the money is still yours you just do n't have control of it until you turn 18 while probably not an issue here the transferring of money between you and your mom and then back is considered a gift by the irs if the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion based on the clarification that the question is in reference to india while i do n't know the particulars of the law in india my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains the main difference that i would see been india and the us would be the gift tax exclusions unless someone else knows otherwise i would still expect the law in india to see the current account as being the property of the mother

hence new employer pays a part of the salary as per diem compensation    along with regular salary and says that per diem compensation is    non taxable per diem is not taxable but that is not what you 're describing it appears that either you or the prospective employer misunderstood what per diem is as per us law is it legally allowed non taxable per diem compensation    to employees yes what are the pros and cons of having per diem compensation per diem is not compensation it is not part of your salary it is not part of your employment contract if i have to report my salary to any one like banks insurance    companies do i need to include per diem compensation or not no because it is not compensation back to the first item per diem is paid to you during business trips when you 're away from your tax home it is not part of your compensation and is only allowed for business trips contract work on site for any prolonged period of time 1 year or more as a definitive rule but can be less is not a business trip for that period of time your tax home becomes that location so you 're not away you 're home you should discuss it with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state but it seems to me that either you misunderstood something or your prospective employer is trying to evade taxes both yours and his by part of your compensation as per diem it is very likely that when you get caught the employer will just issue you 1099 on the amounts and leave you hanging

check out the questions about why stock prices are what they are in a nutshell a stock 's value is based on the future prospects of the company generally speaking if a growth company is paying a dividend that payment is going to negatively affect the growth of the business the smart move is to re invest that capital and make more money as a shareholder you are compensated by a rising stock price when a stock is n't growing quickly a dividend is a better way for a stockholder to realize value if a gas and electric company makes a billion dollars investing that money back into the company is not going to yield a large return and since those types of companies do n't really grow too much the stocks typically trade in a range and do n't see the type of appreciation that a growth stock will so it makes sense to pay out the dividend to the shareholders

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

the bank i work with would be more inclined to expand an existing heloc rather than write a new one i think that would be your best bet if you decide to continue borrowing against your home consider that your own income would have to support the repayment of these larger homes if it is why did n't you buy a larger home to begin with as far as increasing the appraisal you do n't usually get one dollar of increased appraisal for each dollar you spend on improvements unless you have a rundown house in a nice neighborhood part of the appraisal comes from a comparison with the appraisals of the other homes nearby eventually you get close enough to par with the other houses that anyone looking for something more expensive will often choose a different neighborhood entirely update to your edit that mentions the original lender will cap the amount you can borrow you can take additional secondary mortgages helocs but the interest rate is usually higher because it is not the first mortgage i do n't generally recommend it but the option is there

i do n't have a formula for anything like this but it is important to note that the current value of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it for example let 's consider a house   you can get an appraisal done on your house where your home is inspected and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared   however this value is only theoretical   if you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value the same hold true for collectibles   if i have something rare that i need cash for immediately i can take it to a pawn shop and get cash   however if i take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector i can get more for it this is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation   if the current market value of your shares is $ 10 million but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today you are n't going to get $ 10 million   but if you take your time selling a little at a time you are more likely to get much closer to this $ 10 million number a motivated seller means that the price will drop

standard nfc for payments reads a straight copy of the card details does not generate any one time use card number does not employ any over the air encryption or even a challenge response system the normal contactless payment process does involve transaction specific signatures   however what process is used depends on the vendor equipment and the scheme visa mastercard amex a mode if supported allows the card number and expiry date to be read there is a good description at which covers magnetic stripe mode and emv mode etc for each scheme mastercard visa etc do things differently mastercard contactless mastercard transactions can be performed in either emv mode or mag stripe mode after entry point has initiated a transaction the mastercard kernel issues a get processing options command in the response from the card a data object called the application interchange profile determines whether the transaction will continue in either emv mode or mag stripe mode the also determines if on device cardholder verification is supported emv mode m chip the commands exchanged with the card for emv mode closely resemble those used for an emv contact transaction with read record commands being used to retrieve all the card data followed by a generate application request to obtain a unique transaction specific from the card once all of these exchanges have been completed the card can be removed from the rf field however unlike for contact transactions not all the transaction processing occurs before the card exchanges have been completed this is to the contactless transaction performance by reducing the amount of time the card is required to remain in the rf field my emphasis according to visa uk our technology uses the chip on your card to generate unique that ’s techie speak for a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted or encoded text and digital signatures to protect your payments digital signatures are like handwritten signatures in some ways but they are much more difficult to forge my emphasis according to the uk card association a fraudster can steal my details from my contactless card fact you have to be extremely close to someone for their gadget to be able to read your card and even then all they would ever get is the card number and expiry date that ’s the same information you see by simply looking at the front of any card there ’s no way anyone can get the security code on the back of the card your name and address or bank account details the vast majority of online retailers require additional details like these and others to make a purchase however according to a guardian newspaper report of 2015 07 25 researchers bought cheap widely available card scanners from a mainstream website to see if they could steal key details from a contactless card they tested 10 different credit and debit cards that were meant to be coded to mask personal data and were able to read crucial data that was meant to be hidden it then went shopping with the information it had obtained and was able to successfully place orders for items including a £ 3,000 television set so yes even in the civilized world our security is undermined by a combination of how does apple pay work see apple pay must be using the mag stripe mode of the emv contactless specifications clearly apple pay must following the emv contactless specifications of books and for mastercard visa and american express transactions respectively more specifically it must be following what i called above the mobile phone profile of the contactless specifications it must be implementing the contactless mag stripe mode since magnetic stripe infrastructure is still prevalent in the us it may or may not be implementing contactless emv mode today but will probably implement it in the future as the infrastructure for supporting payments with contact cards is phased in over the next year in the us

one explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is price discrimination there is a working paper on the subject by and 2008 the abstract of which reads prices for goods such as blades for razors ink for printers and concessions at movies are often     set well above cost   theory has shown that this could yield   a profitable price discrimination     strategy often termed metering   the idea is that a customer ’s intensity of demand for     aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to     pay for the primary good e.g. admission   if this correlation in tastes for the two goods is     positive a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price     admissions plus concessions from higher type   customers   this paper develops a simple     aggregate model of discrete continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested     using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data   model simulations illustrate     that the can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above below or     equal to their marginal cost   we then apply the approach to box office and concession data from     a chain of spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from     customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket   and 1992 make a similar argument in a article   they essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the group 's choice the firm has additional market power we present models in which price discrimination in the context of   a    two part price can occur in some competitive markets purchases   take    place in groups which choose which firms to patronize while   firms    are perfectly competitive with respect to   groups they have   some    market power over individual consumers who are constrained   by their    groups choices we find that firms will charge an entry fee   that is     below marginal cost   and   the   second part of   the   price is   marked    up   above marginal cost the   markup not only is positive   but    increases with the quality of the product the quote you are looking for is similar and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination   from the armchair economist p. the purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from    customers that purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and    expensive movie tickets instead the purpose of expensive popcorn is    to extract different sums from   different customers popcorn lovers    who have more fun at the movies pay more for their additional    pleasure that is some people like popcorn more than others   the latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people

maybe you know something i do n't but as far as i 'm aware you ca n't get rid of it   student loans are with you for   you will be sent to collections but it does n't disappear after 7 years   settlements are incredibly rare unless your loan is ballooning in which case a settlement does n't change all that much   you will lose tax benefits the government will garnish 15 of your wages and you will be a debt slave until it 's paid off   defaulting on student loans is much much more painful than defaulting on private loans   the only exception to this is if you 've made 120 months of repayments while employed at a qualifying non profit or governmental organization   and even then it only applies to federal loans and there are exceptions better not refinance or the clock resets for example   also if you default you will no longer be eligible   private student loans have no escape and are equally   thank your elected representatives

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

the rebate amount is a non qualified distribution irs pub 969 describes how the hsa works reporting distributions on your return how you report your distributions depends on whether or not you use the distribution for qualified medical expenses defined earlier if you use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you do not pay tax on the distribution but you have to report the distribution on form 8889 however the distribution of an excess contribution taken out after the due date including extensions of your return is subject to tax even if used for qualified medical expenses follow the instructions for the form and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you do not use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you must pay tax on the distribution report the amount on form 8889 and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you have a taxable hsa distribution include it in the total on form 1040 or form 1040nr line 21 and enter hsa and the amount on the dotted line next to line 21 you may have to pay an additional 20 tax on your taxable distribution i looked at several plans regarding how to handle mistaken distributions example a what if i accidentally use my hsa visa debit card for a non qualified expense    to fix this problem just bring that same amount into any local branch and tell us it was a mistaken distribution we can then put the funds back into your hsa and correct the problem   example b   you ’re allowed to correct mistaken    hsa withdrawals when there is clear and convincing    evidence that amounts were distributed from an hsa    because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause you    can correct the mistake by repaying the withdrawal    no later than april 15 following the first year that you    knew or should have known that the withdrawal was    a mistake when a correction is made the mistaken    withdrawal does not have to be included in gross    income or be subject to the 6 percent additional tax and    the repayment does not count as an excess contribution    if an error is made by in its role as the    administrator will be responsible for    taking appropriate action check with your plan trustee on their procedure to fix the mistaken withdrawal

if you have someplace to put the money which you think will yield significantly better returns by all means sell and buy that on the other hand if you think this stock is likely to recover its value you might want to hold it or even buy more as a contrarian investment buy low sell high as much as possible and diversify you need to make a judgement call about the odds we can point out the implications but in the end whether to sell buy hold or hedge is your decision this also suggests you need to sit down and draw up a strategy over every decision is not productive if you have a plan you make this sort of decision before you ever put money into the stock in the first place

the balance sheet for a bank is the list of assets and liabilities that the bank directly is responsible for   this would be things like loans the bank issues and accounts with the bank banks can make both balance sheet loans meaning a loan that says on the balance sheet one the bank gains the profits from but holds the risks for also   they can also make off balance sheet loans meaning they securitize the loan sell it off such as the mortgage backed securities most major banks i.e. chase citibank etc could be called balance sheet banks because at least some portion of their lending comes from their balance sheet   not 100 by any means they participate in the security swaps extensively just like everyone does but they do at least some normal boring lending just as you would explain a bank to a five year old   bank takes in deposits from account holders loans that money out to people who want to buy homes or start businesses however some particularly smaller firms do n't work this way they do n't take responsibility for the money or the loans   they instead manage assets or some similar term i think of it like the difference between wal mart and a consignment store   wal mart buys things from its distributors and sells them taking the risk of the item not selling and the reward of the profit from selling to itself   on the other hand a consignment store takes on neither it takes a flat fee to host your items in its store but takes no risk you own the items nor the majority of the profit in this case financial group is not a bank per se they do n't have accounts they manage funds instead   note the following statement on their services page for example financial group holds no risk positions and no unwanted inventory of securities which preserves the integrity of our capital and assures our clients that we will be able to obtain bids and offers for them regardless of adverse market conditions they 're not taking your money and then making their own investments they 're advising you how to invest your money or they 're helping do it for you but it 's your money going out and your risk and reward

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

i think it is clear that this has a lot to do with keeping salaries down     the company has a maximal possible salary limit i.e. the most they would be willing and able to pay for what you do   you have a minimal possible salary   both of you know that the current salary is in between the two figures   for negotiations it would be very useful for you to know the maximal possible salary i.e. the utmost the company would be willing to pay you to stay and continue the company on the other hand is obliged to keep costs low and hence would like to know your new minimum acceptable salary so they wo n't make an offer too high     but if you knew all salaries of people around you you could make a better guess about your own maximal possible salary   you probably would over estimate it because we all tend to over estimate our own relevance and competence but it would be a better informed guess at least   the company would hence give up an informational advantage which could lead them to have higher costs   so they will ask you how much you were offered at the competitor i.e. they will be close to your new minimum acceptable salary while trying to prevent you from learning anything about the maximal possible salary

it is important to remember that the tax brackets in the u.s. are marginal   this means that the first part of your income is taxed at 10 the next part at 15 next at 25 etc   therefore if you find yourself just on the edge of a tax bracket it really does not make any difference which side of that line you end up falling on that having been said of course reducing your taxable income reduces your taxes   there are lots of deductions you can take if you qualify   depending on what type of health insurance coverage you have a health savings account hsa is a great way to shelter some income from taxes   charitable contributions are also an easy way to reduce your taxes you do n't really personally benefit from them but if you 'd rather send your money to a good cause than to uncle sam that 's an easy way to do it

the only problem that i see is that by not giving the 20 right away you might need to pay pmi for a few months in addition in the case of conventional loans i heard that banks will not remove the pmi after reaching 80 ltv without doing an appraisal in order to be removed automatically you need to reach 78 ltv   finally i think you can get a better interest by giving 20 down and you can get a conventional loan instead of a fha loan which offers the option to avoid the pmi altogether on fha you have two one upfront and one monthly and the monthly one is for the life of the loan if you give less than 10

the question is how does $ for 6.5 years fit into your budget or to put it another way what wo n't you be spending that money on housing food vacations retirement fund investments though you can invest your car fund in the meantime building a hefty emergency fund kids college funds saving for a down payment on a home charity etc are all other places that money could go i do n't know what your needs are today let alone 6.5 years into the future but i 'd encourage you to consider all your financial goals and evaluate where this expense would fit   it seems your plan is to save up to the total cost of the car and then buy it in cash that 's a valid strategy but it means you 'll have no car unless you already own one for 6.5 years   do you need a car if so what will you drive in the meantime and even if you already own another car outright you 'll have gas and maintenance expenses if you do n't need a car then $ 100,000 is a rather extravagant purchase for something we just established you do n't need would you be happier having this expensive car in 6.5 years or having a series of less expensive cars starting now or buying a used model of the expensive car sooner or having no car at all also a lot can change in 6.5 years cars will evolve and there 'll be different models and options available maybe your salary will have doubled or maybe you 'll be unemployed you could be living in a different city have a different commute and maybe you 'll need a minivan to haul kids around or live in a place with bad winters and want a drive you 'll also need to be prepared for the additional expenses that generally come with expensive cars such as higher insurance and maintenance rates and parking could be costly if you live in an expensive city   the other option of course if the car is truly something you need want and can afford would be to save up a sizable down payment and finance the rest so you can get the car sooner finally there 's nothing wrong with saving your money for 6.5 years building up that fund and then what makes the most sense for you at that time maybe it will the car maybe something else but the nice thing about having savings is that it gives you more options

if you start an llc with you as the sole member it will be considered a disregarded entity   this basically means that you have the protection of being a company but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation   now here is the good stuff   if you file form you can change your sole member llc to file as an s corp.   once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes   you will need to employ yourself and give a reasonable salary   this will be reported to the irs and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation now as the sole member you can then pay yourself distribution to share holders from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax check with your tax guy and make sure to document correctly   the other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar irs tax year   this means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you do n't bump yourself into another tax bracket   example   you cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution   if you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket   if your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check

sovereign states borrow money explicitly in a two primary ways a sovereign can not be compelled to repay debt and there is n't a judicial process like bankruptcy to erase debt when sovereigns default they negotiate new terms with creditors and pay back some fraction of the actual debt owed   they can also print money to repay debt which has other nasty consequences but while a state can not be compelled to repay a debt creditors can not be compelled to loan money to the state either any enterprise of sufficient size needs access to capital via loans to meet daily obligations in anticipation of revenue even when times are good defaulting makes borrowing impossible or expensive and is avoided regarding using your military to avoid repaying debt remember what napoleon said an army travels on its stomach military campaigns are expensive no borrowing ability means the soldiers do n't get paid and the food fuel and ammo do n't get delivered smaller countries have other risks as well many nations are essentially forced to use us dollars as a reserve currency or are forced by the market to borrow money in a foreign currency this creates a situation where any risk of non payment results in a deep devaluation of the local currency when your debt is denominated in dollars these shifts can dramatically increase your debt obligations from a local currency point of view you also run the risk that a larger or richer company will park in your harbor and seize assets as payment the us and britain engaged in this several times during the 19th and 20th centuries in general not paying the bills has a effect bad situations get worse and they do so quickly

it 's a real pain in the rear to get cash only from a bank teller the end result of cutting the card as suggested there is a self control issue here that like weight loss should ultimately be addressed for a psychologically healthy lifestyle you do n't mention a budget here a budget is one of the first tools necessary for setting spending limits categorizing your money into categories such as   will force you to look at any purchase in context of your other needs and goals note that savings is at the top of the list supporting the to pay yourself first make realistic allowances for each budget category then force yourself to stick to this budget by whatever means necessary cash in several envelopes labeled with each category can physically reinforce your priorities the debit card is usually left at home for now   roll remaining funds from each month over into the next month to cover irregular larger expenses such as auto repairs   what sort of investing are we talking about if you are just talking about retirement savings an automatic deduction of just $ 50 to a roth ira account at a discount brokerage every pay check is a good start an emergency fund of 6 months expenses is also common financial advice and can likewise be built from small automatic deductions in defense of wise use of plastic a debit card can be a great retroactive budgeting tool because it records all spending for you it takes a lot more effort to save and enter receipts for cash and a compulsive spender without a budget is just as likely to run out of money whether or not he uses plastic you could keep receipts in the envelope you take the cash out of when you 're getting started if you are so addicted to spending that you must cut your debit card to enforce your budget at least consider this a temporary measure to get yourself under control when the bank issues you a new card re evaluate this decision and the self control measures you 've implemented to see if you 've grown enough to keep the card

no a jump in market capitalization does not equal the amount that has been invested   market cap is simply the stock price times the total number of shares this represents a theoretical value of the company i say theoretical because the company might not be able to be sold for that at all   the quoted stock price is simply what the last buyer and seller of stock agreed upon for the price of their trade they really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that   the stock price can move on very little volume in this case amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday and the price jumped in after hours trading the stock price is up but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday   after the market opens today and many more shares are traded we 'll get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price but no matter what the price does the change in market cap does not equal the amount of new money being invested in the company market cap is the price of the most recent trades extrapolated out across all the shares

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods low rates and qe were intended to help revive a economy but unfortunately demand has not risen but rather the velocity of money has dropped like a rock   at some point we will see the economy recover and the excess money in the system will need to be removed to avoid the inflation you suggest may occur of course as rates rise to a more normal level the price of all debt will adjust   this question may not be on topic for this board but if we avoid politics and keep it close to pf it might remain

a lot of credit card companies these days uses what they call daily interest where they charge the interest rate for the number of days till you pay off what you spent this allows them to make more money than the period billing   the idea of credit theoretically is that there is n't really a day when you can borrow without paying interest in theory

gt as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves    debtors owe creditors creditors are by and large the banks forget about we ourselves   one thing we are taught in school is that banks earn money on the spread between what a creditor pays minus what a saver earns in interest on his deposit in reality such private savings pretty much do not exist when someone borrows from the bank they mostly are n't borrowing another person 's savings the bank is creating new currency through the issuance of debt   gt the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system    i 'm not sure what you mean by does not exist in the system the way it works is you borrow a dollar and now you owe a dollar plus the interest on the dollar since each new loan creates more debt than currency the monetary system can never shrink or it if you mean that the currency is by any objective measure of value that is correct    gt therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   there is no possibility of repaying it both the red team and the blue team are in on this if you 're worried about the 99 you should be advocating commodity money because that is the only way to stop theft by inflation if you 're worried about yourself get informed as to how these plans have played out in history and how you might protect yourself

maybe there 's more to this story because as written your sister seems well a little irrational is it possible that the bank will try to cheat you and demand that you pay a loan again that you 've already paid off or maybe not deliberately cheat you but make a mistake and lose track of the fact that you paid sure it 's possible but if you 're going to about that what about all the other possible ways that someone could cheat you what if you go to a store hand over your cash for the purchase and then the clerk insists that you never gave him any cash what if you buy a car and it turns out to be stolen what if you buy insurance and when you have a claim the insurance company refuses to pay what if someone you 've never met or even heard of before suddenly claims that you are the father of her baby and demands child support etc etc realistically banks are about record keeping their business is pretty much all about record keeping mistakes like this are very rare and a big business like a bank is unlikely to blatantly cheat you they can and do make millions of dollars legally why should they break the law and risk paying huge fines and going to prison for a few hundred dollars they may give you a lousy deal like charge you outrageous overdraft fees and pay interest on your deposit but they 're not going to lie about how much you owe they just do n't i suggest that you not live your life in fear of all the might be 's take reasonable steps to protect yourself and get on with it read contracts before you sign even if the other person gets impatient while you sit there reading especially if the other person insists that you sign without reading when you pay off a loan you should get a piece of paper from the bank saying the loan has been paid stuff this piece of paper in a filing cabinet and keep it for years and years get a copy of your credit report periodically and make sure that there are no errors on it like incorrect loan balances i check mine once every year or two some people advise checking it every couple of months it all depends how nervous you are and how much time you want to spend on it then get on with your life has your sister had some bad experience with loans in the past or has she never borrowed money and she 's just confused about how it works that 's why i wonder if there 's more to the story if there 's some basis for her fears

three companies may have copies of it the bank the title company aka settlement company and perhaps the real estate agent the bank assuming you had a mortgage is usually the easiest one to contact as you 're probably still making payments to them they may have sent you the form in a large packet when you sold the house and paid off the old mortgage there is a tradition of sending customers their entire mortgage file once they pay off the mortgage after 30 years which is very rare nowadays but many banks still adhere to it because the mortgage business is built on momentum and very slow to change otherwise the title company should have a copy of it if you do n't know which company was used they should be named as trustee on the deed of trust which in most states is the official name of the document that we call a mortgage the county recorder 's office will have a copy of that deed of trust on record if you ca n't find it anywhere some counties have these so you could find it online but some would require you to request a copy and pay a small printing fee for it

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

whoa whoa whoa let 's not twist that data and make an assertion that it does n't support yes medical inflation has outpaced the cpi for ages but when you spending into medicare us single payer and private insurers medicare is able to better contain my hypothesis likely due to its ability to leverage its scale and keep costs low while private insurers are fragmented against strong provider networks    but wait you 're thinking should n't market forces keep insurance outlays low it 's econ 101 right theoretically they should but this ignores the industrial structure of healthcare providers and assumes perfect competition that does n't exist typically providers doctors groups hospitals etc are highly localized and able to exercise significant market power in a relative to several insurance plans who are competing to contract that provider in network for example when aetna and go up against hypothetically to negotiate payment rates has the ability to obtain high reimbursement rates because the three insurers have to have that provider in network to remain competitive ironically the less competition on the insurer side in that market the better reimbursement rates would be observed since the sole insurer would capture a large fraction of patients in the geographic area served and could use that volume to negotiate better rates   finally there 's the overhead issue medicare has lower overhead expenses than private insurers do again my guess greater economies of scale and lower advertising and marketing costs coupled with no profit motive even health themselves agree resources pdf that medicare has lower overhead costs and that includes some questionable addition of what the authors claim are hidden medicare expenses   i 'm inclined to believe that a single payer is probably more efficient and cheaper than a fragmented private insurance market that said i also find some sympathy to the argument that maintaining a robust private insurance market may spur innovation on payor innovation e.g. increased participation in wellness programs for or increasing the likelihood that patients be more sensitive to costs and benefits when seeking care after all countries like germany and switzerland are able to maintain a private insurance market while ensuring nearly universal coverage either way though arguing that health inflation alone makes single payer systems unsustainable is n't a strong argument since private insurers are currently doing worse on cost

you are not actually entitled to any raise at all unless you had something contractually legally binding which made that so i 'm answering this from the uk but it has been common practice for people over the last 10 years or so to receive no yearly raise in some sectors this is what i would consider a bad raise if wages are not kept in line with inflation you are effectively earning less every year in this regard i would not work for any employer who did not offer an annual raise that was at the very least covering the rate of inflation these rates are easy to find in your country by googling it in terms of a standard raise i would argue there is no such thing this depends on the industry sector you work in your employers opinion of your performance note i 've used the word opinion because sometimes you may think the effort you put in is different to what they think be prepared to give evidence of what you 've achieved for them with things to back it up a good raise is anything which is way above a standard raise since there is no concise of a standard raise this is also hard to quantify as others have mentioned do not stay in a role where you are not being given a raise that covers inflation because it means every year you have less purchasing power which is akin to your salary going down it 's very easy to justify to an employer you 're leaving and indeed one you 're going to why you 're making the move under these conditions

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

meh not really   while there was some idea that housing prices would continue to rise forever the packaging of bad loans has nothing to do with optimism that 's outright fraud if you really want to stretch the definition you might be able to say they had a fantasy that they were n't going to get caught because well they had n't for nearly two decades   honestly though just google fraud housing market or mortgage banks and you 'll find more than enough direct proof of fraud and deception

first i do n't think your parents are ripping you off but you should get your agreement in writing the fact that you never own more than 25 does n't matter if the condo 's value is increasing you are in fact building equity your share of the equity just does n't increase but it does n't decrease either for example if the condo is worth $ 300,000 now you have $ 75,000 in equity of course if the value is decreasing so is your equity if you are paying $ 500/month in interest as op clarified above and you do n't have a written agreement you are probably unable to claim that payment as mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions on u.s. federal or state tax returns thus you may be losing out on a legal tax deduction assuming you earn enough to itemize they will need to give you each year the proper irs form for mortgage interest form 1098 and they have to claim the $ 500/month as interest income on their tax returns having a written and signed contract eliminates confusion and potential for misunderstanding the future and it sounds like you are already experiencing some doubt and confusion now your rate seems within market rates for an interest only loan let 's say you wanted to buy out your parents share of the condo right now would you pay $ 115,000 or would you have to get an appraisal to find out what the condo is worth now if you ca n't answer that question you need to get that in writing so that you wo n't have an argument over it someday if the condo has appreciated significantly and all you have to pay is the $ 115,000 then that 's a sweet deal for you because you 'd be buying out a much more valuable property for much less than it 's worth if that is the agreement and the property is appreciating no guarantee especially with condos then you are essentially building equity if the property is declining in value and you do wish to sell it then you wo n't have to pay $ 115,000 they 'll just end up with their 75 share which will be less than the $ 115 k they invested both of you would lose some of your investment but you would have had all the benefits of living in a nice condo all those years and they would n't they are definitely taking more risk than you are second if you had $ 40,000 cash saved up your parents probably raised you with some good financial sense and work ethic so i 'm optimistic they have good intentions for your future operate from that frame of mind when you go to ask for a written agreement next read up about equity share agreements there are many models that will help inform your decisions but you should engage a real estate lawyer to help you draw up a fair agreement for both parties   i was in an equity share agreement for my first townhouse it 's a common practice and it wo n't cost all that much to get one created it 's worth the money to get it done properly

foreign stocks have two extra sources of risk attached to them exchange rate and political   exchange rate risk is obvious if i buy a stock in a foreign currency and there is a currency movement that makes that investment worth less i lose money no matter what the stock does this can be offset using exchange rate swaps this is ceteris paribus of course changes in exchange rate can give a comparative advantage to international and exporting companies that will improve the fundamentals and so increase the price of the stock relative to a local firm the economics of the firms in particular are not explored in this answer as it would get too complicated and long if i did political risk relates not only to the problems surrounding international politics such as a country deciding that foreign nationals may no longer own shares in their national industries or deciding to seize foreign nationals assets as happens in some areas your home country may also decide to apply sanctions to the country in which you are invested thus making it impossible to get your money back even though the foreign country will allow you to redeem them or sell diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult there are further problems in lack of understanding of foreign countries laws tax code customs etc relating to investments and the necessity to find legal representation in a country you may never have visited if there are issues there is also a hidden risk in that as an individual investor you are not likely to be reading the local financial news for that country regularly enough to spot company specific issues arising by the time these issues get into international media its far too late as all of the local investors have sold out of their positions already the risks are probably no different if you have the time to monitor international relations and the foreign country 's news and have fx swaps in place to counteract fx risk as the funds and investment banks do but as an individual investor the time required is not feasible

now i do n't know the history of banks but from the overall idea of a bank it seems like they were created to help people organize and have control of their money i think they 've changed a lot and every company is out to make money but the bottom line is that they 're there for you you do n't have to use a bank if you do n't want to though it may be difficult to get through life without doing so   lol why would i get downvoted that does n't make any sense

the current mortgaged owner would typically not have the right to sell any portion of the house without approval from the bank the bank does n't own the house through the mortgage but they do have a series of rights that in some cases look similar to ownership   remember that a mortgage is just a loan that uses a house as collateral to reduce the risk to the lender in the event of default if it was just a personal loan without collateral then there would be a much higher risk of default and therefore the interest rate would be closer to 20 than 2 but because the loan was taken with collateral that collateral ca n't be sold without the bank 's permission if the bank allowed this to happen then one risk would be exactly as you say that the mortgagee stops paying the bank and the bank no longer is able to recover the full value of the loan on selling the remaining 50 of the house owed as collateral

stop spending on the cc with the revolving balance    after the discussion below i feel i should clarify that what i am advocating is that you make your prepayment though i disagree with calling it that to the existing cc   then rather than spending on that card spend somewhere else so you wo n't accrue any interest related to your spending   at the end of the month send any excess to the account that has a balance   this question is no different than i have $ x of cash should i let it sit in a savings account or should i send it to my cc balance   yes 100 you should send this $ 750 to your cc balance   then stop spending on that cc and move your daily spending to cash or some other place that wo n't accrue interest at all the first step to paying off debt is to stop adding to the balance that accrues interest   it 's not worth the energy to determine the change in the velocity of paydown by paying more frequently when you could simply spend on a separate card that does n't accrue any interest because you pay the entire balance every month the reason something like this may be advisable on a heloc but not a cc is the interest rate   a heloc might run you 4 or 5 while your cc is probably closer to 17   in one situation your monthly interest is 0.4 and in the other your monthly interest is 1.4   the velocity of interest accrual at cc rates is just too high to justify ever putting regular spending on top of an existing revolving balance   additionally i doubt there is anyone who is advocating for anyone to charge their heloc for daily spending   you would move daily spending to somewhere that is n't accruing interest no matter what   you would use a heloc to pay down your cc debt in a lump or make a large purchase in a lump   your morning coffee should never be spent in a way that will accrue interest immediately ever stop spending on the that are carrying a balance period generally credit cards have a grace period before interest is charged   as long as a balance is n't carried from one statement period to the next you maintain your grace period   if you spend $ 100 in the first month you have your card say the period is january 1 to january 31 you 'll get a statement saying you owe $ 100 for january and payment is due by feb 28   if you pay your $ 100 statement balance before february 28 you wo n't pay any interest even if you charged an additional $ 500 on february 15 you 'll simply get your february statement indicating your statement balance is $ 500 and payment is due by march 31 still no interest   but   if you pay $ 99 for january leaving just a single dollar to roll over you now owe interest on your entire average daily balance   so now you 'll receive your february statement indicating $ 501 + interest on approximately $ of average daily balance $ 1 carried + $ 500 charged on feb 15 due by march 31   that $ 1 you let roll over just cost you $ in interest $   and   now that balance is continuing to accrue interest in the month of march until the day you make a payment   it typically takes two consecutive months of payment in full before the grace period is restored there is no sense in continuing to spend on a cc that is carrying a balance and accruing interest even if you intend to pay all of your current month spending entirely   you can avoid 100 of the interest related to your regular spending by simply using a different card and no rewards will beat the interest you 're charged

besides overnight news events and auction mechanisms there is a more fundamental reason the price of a stock is always moving   theoretically the stock price will move slightly even in the unlikely scenario that absolutely nothing of interest happens during the entire night   let me go into that in some more detail stock valuation using discounted cash flow one of the fundamental reasons that stock value is constantly changing is because underneath every stock there is a company that expects to make some kind of profit or loss in the future we have to go into the fundamentals of stock value to understand why this is important one popular way to determine the value of a stock is by looking into the future and summing up all the earnings or cashflows it has yet to produce you have to reduce each amount by a certain factor that gets larger for payments that are farther into the future think of it this way a dollar in hand now is better than a dollar that you get tomorrow this method of valuation is called discounted cash flow dcf see the wikipedia article on dcf time 's effect on stock value now take the close price c and the open price let 's assume that since there has been no news the expectations for future earnings are the same for c and remember that the discounting factor for these earnings is dependent on the time until the cashflow occurs for o this time is slightly shorter than for c and therefore the value will be slightly higher or lower when the company is expected to incur losses so now you can see that even without all the external forces that continuously push and pull on the stock price a stock still changes in value over time hope this helps

there are a lot of open questions about if this is your only accessible money or if you have other emergency funds and if you have any retirements savings and when do you plan to retire but leaving this all aside you currently pay 2.65 on the mortgage and you make less on savings maybe 1 or 1.5 so putting the savings into the mortgage makes you the difference which is a good deal however you need to reflect this with your risk and your long term goals and look at potential even better deals for example you could put the savings into higher risk higher gain investments let ’s assume index funds and make 6 10 per year in average that obviously is a lot more why would you not want to do that investing like this is a long term plan if this is your only savings emergency fund or if you need the money within the next five years you should not do it it could catch you in a bad market situation and then it might be a severe loss if you are sure you do n’t need it for at least five if not ten years invest it and keep the mortgage you will easily beat its interest rate if you are risk averse and ca n’t sleep with your savings doing while you watch that is also not a plan for you there are many things to consider and your personal situation is relevant for the decision consider all options and be sure to always have a emergency fund remaining it is also not black and white there are options in between of your two propositions pay some in and keep some for emergencies

i am also confused by what he says the djia has not been at 900 for decades however a $ 36 dividend is 4 per unit if you get $ 9 per unit per quarter 2/3 of 4 is that is inside his 7.5 to 5.5 how much you have in dividend paying stocks vs. bonds most often is a function of your age for example i have heard the advice of subtracting your age in years from 110 and that would be the percent you hold in dividend paying stocks at age 30 you would have 80 in stocks at age 60 you would be 50 in stocks there are retirement funds that do this for you   but the bottom line all depends on your risk tolerance i have a large tolerance for risk so even though i am currently retired i only have 10 of my money in a safe investment ticker = pgf it pays 5.5 per year   the rest is in a leveraged junk bond fund that pays 15.5 per year

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it

okay i think i managed to find the precise answer to this problem it involves solving a non linear exponential equation but i also found a good approximate solution using the taylor series see below for a spreadsheet you can use let 's start by defining the growth factors per period for money in the bank and money invested    now let s be the amount ready to be invested after periods so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods that is   the key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered so let 's introduce a new variable t = the total number of time periods elapsed so if money is ready to invest every periods there will be separate investments and the future value of the investments will be   this formula is exact in the case of integer t and n and a good approximation when t and n are not substituting s we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n   fortunately only a couple of terms in fv depend on n so we can find the derivative after some effort   equating the derivative to zero we can remove the denominator and assuming t is greater than zero we can divide by the constant t   to simplify the equation we can define some extra     then we can define a function f(n and write the equation as   note that g and r are all constant from here there are two options use newton 's method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of f(n this can be done in a number of software packages like matlab etc or by using a graphics calculator solve approximately using a taylor series polynomial i will use this method here the taylor series of f(n around is   the series to the first three terms we get a polynomial with constant coefficients   using r g and defined above let and be the coefficients of the taylor series for f(n     then   n should be rounded to the nearest whole number to be certain check the values above and below n using the formula for fv using the example from the question for example i might put aside $ 100 every week to invest into a stock    with an expected growth of 9 p.a but brokerage fees are $    for how many weeks should i accumulate the $ 100 before investing if i    can put it in my high interest bank account at 4 p.a until then using newton 's method to find roots of f(n above we get n = using the closed form approximate solution we get n = checking this against the fv with t = evenly divisible by each n + 1 tested therefore you should wait for n = 14 periods keeping that money in the bank investing it together with the money in the next period so you will make an investment every 14 + 1 = 15 weeks here 's one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet stackexchange does n't allow tables in their syntax at this time so i 'll show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste formulae   copy and paste column a copy and paste column b results   remember n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank so you will want to invest every weeks in this case every 15 weeks

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

based on my experience hiring working with a fortune 500 company legal team to make hiring decisions i do n't believe anything illegal necessarily happened   you 're allowed to discriminate against that list all the time like when hiring a model an actor or a pastor that have to be a specific age gender ethnicity religion etc or other jobs that require it   and yes any public facing position at an explicitly christian organization does require it   if i call a christian plumbing company i would expect them to send a christian plumber   you can also discriminate against the degree to which someone is religious as well   imagine if you could n't use answers like do you go to church regularly when interviewing a pastor   i worked previously for a christian organization that required many positions to be christians like salesmen and board members   all other internal positions like accountants etc they would not even ask are you christian for legal reasons because it was n't required for the job   so it was either explicitly required in the job description or they could n't ask or take it into account when hiring you

to me the simple answer might be to tap the equity in the $ 400k home you owe $ on and use the proceeds to purchase the new retirement home even if you were to do that you 'd still have almost $ 100k in untapped equity in the existing home no mortgage on the retirement home nothing out of pocket other than refi fees and probably no more of a mortgage payment than you already have on the house with equity   i do n't see any reason why the bank would n't go for that especially if you 've got a good payment history on your existing mortgage i hope this helps good luck

st. john 's church richmond virginia march 23   mr president no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different men often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it will not be thought to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions at such a time through fear of giving offence i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of toward the of heaven which i above all kings   mr. president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that till she us into is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it   i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a to your feet suffer not yourselves to be with a kiss ask yourselves how this reception of our petition with these war like preparations which cover our waters and our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to and humble what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have we have we have we have ourselves before the and have its to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our have been our have produced additional violence and insult our have been disregarded and we have been with contempt from the foot of the in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be if we mean to preserve those privileges for which we have been so long we mean not to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us   they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so an but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally and when a british guard shall be in every house shall we gather strength by and inaction shall we acquire the means of resistance by lying on our backs and hugging the phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who over the of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their may be heard on the plains of boston the war is let it come i repeat it sir let it come   it is in vain sir to the matter gentlemen may cry peace there is no peace the war is actually begun the next that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of arms our are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death   this speech is the best response i can give

my interpretation of that sentence is that you ca n't do the buying selling of shares outright sans margin because of the massive quantity of shares he 's talking about   so you have to use margin to buy the stocks however because in order to make significant money with this sort of strategy you probably need to be working dozens of stocks at the same time you need to be familiar with portfolio margin   since your broker does not calculate margin calls based on individual stocks but rather on the value of your whole portfolio you should have experience handling margin not just on individual stock movements but also on overall portfolio movements for example if 10 by value of the stocks you 're targeting tend to have a correlation of with the price of oil you should probably target another 10 by value in stocks that tend to have a correlation of + 0.8 with the price of oil   and so on and so forth   that way your portfolio can weather big or even small changes in market conditions that would cause a margin call on a novice investor 's portfolio

to one extreme there 's term aside from the commission the premium is buying insurance and that 's it but when the tax and math guys started to get together they were able to use insurance as a wrapper to create products that might have some tax benefits whole life created a product that had an investment component which was able to pay the ever increasing premium costs to the other extreme there are variable annuities with a fixed $ mortality fee which on a large valued account can be a tiny fraction of a percent of the funds invested in effect it 's not an insurance product but an investment one that wrapped in a very thin insurance veil to keep it away from certain security regulations this is likely the product you are being offered or some variation of it

first assuming you are making payments for a savings deposit   the present value of the deposit is the sum of the all the payments discounted to present value   in this case they would be discounted by the rate of inflation £ 100 deposited next year is worth less than £ 100 today because it will be eroded by inflation   with a higher rate of inflation the payments are discounted more heavily so the present value decreases   a deposit or annuity due see calculating the present value of an annuity due can be expressed mathematically like   by induction   so for example the following annuity has a present value of £ the total amount that will be paid for the annuity is 12 x £ 100 = £ 1,200   with a higher rate of inflation say 2 per month and with the same 12 x £ 100 payments the present value of the annuity decreases in excel £ a similar case is that for a loan or ordinary annuity see calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity except the discounting factor is the loan interest rate rather than inflation and repayments are made at the end of each period rather than at the start the present value of a loan is the value of the all the future repayments discounted to present value   with a higher interest rate the payments are discounted more heavily so the present value decreases   a loan can be expressed mathematically like   by induction   so for example the following values fulfill a loan worth £ the total amount that will be paid for the loan is 12 x £ 100 = £ 1,200   with a higher rate of interest say 2 per month and the same 12 x £ 100 repayments the present value of the loan that can be obtained decreases in excel £

the only thing worse than finding out you are paid less than a co worker is finding out that you are paid more than all of your co workers a lot of people who think they would prefer an open and transparent pay scale as in unions change their minds when placed in one    i have worked in and implemented both types as both an employee and as an owner manager there are pluses and minuses to both    transparent pay scale is most effective in a high turnover aggressively performance metric oriented environment where you expect people to be competing for jobs including their own job every day for example a pool of commissioned sales agents the more you sell the more you make winner gets a cadillac runner up gets a set of steak knives loser gets fired that kind of thing if you ca n't meet your numbers we let other people start poaching your territory clients and see what they can do    where it does n't work is in a salary type position where people are expected to have multiple soft duties outside of core performance metrics the reasons are multi fold   one immediate effect of implementing performance based pay for salary type employees is that people who are in the office for 8 hours a day five days a week immediate start their time and energy towards getting another notch up on the pay scale even at the expense of their co workers or the company it intrinsically incentivizes gaming the system finding ways to attach your name to easy metrics and to remove yourself from the most difficult problems the people who are best at hitting metrics are often not even close to the    if instead you take a soft metrics or subjective holistic approach to evaluation then you get a culture of brown and office politics people start the boss 's favorite and pursuing approval and credit rather than performance instead of fostering a team oriented problem solving approach it a counter productive buck passing credit grabbing and blame avoidance approach    note that both of the above intrinsically incentivize risk avoidance if you get paid for the number of projects that have your name on them you find some way to get your name attached to every project and then move on to the next one whether the last one was done or not if you get based on how successful the projects bearing your name are then you avoid anything challenging and make sure only to be attached to the easy ones with the best co workers and so on    alternately let 's say we keep the same generic salary oriented pay structure we just make everyone in a certain tier get equal salary that everyone knows that sucks all the life out of everyone 's so fast it will make your head spin you can not get a raise for doing a better job you get paid the same raise as your worst co worker every year for as long as you work here we will never cut your pay all you have to do is not be the in the so long as you can identify the worst performer in your group and so long as it 's not you your job is safe what time do you have to arrive 5 minutes earlier than the latest arriving person how early can you leave 5 minutes after the earliest one to check out how much work do you have to get done only as much as anyone else is doing what will you get for being the hardest working earliest to arrive latest to leave the same as the worst performer gets you 'll be splitting your raise with him since we do n't credit individuals here just job titles    most jobs that can be easily automated are automated if you need a human employee to do it it 's usually because it involves a amount of soft skills and fuzzy logic type thinking and behavior a machine programmed purely to make as many widgets per hour as possible and motivated to so with human style skills ingenuity and incentives will tear down the whole factory and dismantle all its co workers and ignore all quality controls in order to keep producing widgets    you ca n't reduce human beings to input process output or rather you can but they will invariably find unintended ways to outsmart your design criteria with unintended consequences the reason you need a person instead of an automated process is because you need a whole host hard to define soft fuzzy flexible critical thinking type skills    everyone 's job seems easier to the people who do n't have to do it and there is a tremendous hidden danger to de valuing personal desire to do a good job by quantifying the value of their contribution   personnel management is very difficult to reduce to an engineering problem you usually need good managers who can identify and motivate good employees who will feel lucky to have the job and the salary they have and who will come in every day trying to earn it posting everyone 's pay on a bulletin board negates all those soft skills by putting a quantified black and white relative value on everyone 's contribution    even in a very large organization the marketplace of employees is rarely large enough and the quality of real time metrics is almost never good enough to the bell curve of employee performance you end up making it a square wave that all but the most extreme outliers

if it 's possible in your case to get such a loan then sure providing the loan fees are n't in excess of the interest rate difference   auto loans do n't have the fees mortgages do but check the specific loan you 're looking at it may have some fees and they 'd need to be lower than the interest rate savings car loans can be tricky to refinance because of the value of a used car being less than that of a new car   how much better your credit is likely determines how hard this would be to get   also how much down payment you put down   cars devalue 20 or so instantly a used car with 5 miles on it tends to be worth around 80 of a new car 's cost so if you put less than 20 down you may be underwater meaning the principal left on the loan exceeds the value of the car and so you would n't be getting a fully secured loan at that point however if your loan amount is n't too high relative to the value of the car it should be possible   check out various lenders in advance also check out non lender sites for advice   edmunds.com has some of this laid out for example though they 're an industry based site so they 're not truly unbiased i 'd also recommend using this to help you pay off the loan faster   if you do refinance to a lower rate consider taking the savings and sending it to the lender i.e. keeping your payment the same just lowering the interest charge   that way you pay it off faster

this is back breaking work   our crops are not going to get picked   so here is my conflict   we used to have this weird system that was much like slavery   illegal people god what a fucked up term would come over the border and work for less money because actually living in their own country and actually having a life expectancy was totally fucking impossible   so they would come here and do our hardest jobs until they could figure out how to become citizens and start their own businesses because they had found out what hard work and dedication was and grow our economy   so now if they ca n't get in at all we are either going to have to   stop growing a shitload of food or we are going to have to start making more things a crime so we can arrest more people and put them into slave labor   13th   the title of duvernay 's extraordinary and documentary refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution which reads neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states the progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass and the sprawling american prison industry is laid out by duvernay with with a potent mixture of footage and testimony from a array of activists politicians historians and formerly women and men duvernay creates a work of grand historical synthesis   watch on netflix to see where this all has led

on this the best thing you can do is ask current analysts for help you 're new and people expect you to ask dumb questions at this point so ask them now while you still get a pass   with that being said there 's a strategy to it before you ever ask a question spend at least 5 minutes trying to figure out the answer on your own op did a google search which is great so many people wo n't do this finally the way you ask the question is key i would go to an analyst and say boss asked me to get a list of all us apartment flooring companies i looked on google to see if i could find anything there if you were doing this where would you go to find the information   they 'll usually even walk you through how to do it if there 's something special with the service you have for the task you 'll also make them feel important and you 'll get the task done fast   also if you run into trouble with the boss after presenting it you can always back yourself up by saying you asked around the office for what tool to use and people told you to use that but be strategic with how you say it because you do n't want to throw anyone under the bus

there are two reasons for incorporating a business in canada limiting liability and providing some freedom in structuring your taxes since you are asking about taxes i will restrict myself to that topic first of all remember that if you do n't make much money there is n't much tax to save by clever structuring of your affairs and if you do incorporate you will pay taxes as a corporation and pay taxes again on your salary paid from that corporation it can still be advantageous because the small business tax rate is less that the higher tax brackets of personal taxes and you do n't have to pay out all of the profit as salary if you do n't incorporate you still must pay taxes on your net income from the business see brian 's answer definitely keep track of your income and expenses even if you do n't plan on making money in case you get audited if the cra wants to call your hobby a business you will need to show that you have n't made any profit i am just giving you a few bits of advice because this subject is complicated too complicated for an answer on this site if you are still interested go to your local library and get some books on the subject

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

you should have a partnership agreement of some sort   the reason partnership agreements exist is so nobody can change the game because of the outcome    i 'd say the most typical partnership agreement is that everyone gets an equal cut meaning that everyone also makes an equal contribution   if you have start up expenses of $ 10,000 you 'd each contribute $ 5,000   separately you can determine ownership share by contribution amounts maybe one of you contributed $ 2,000 and the other $ 8,000 this would be an 80/20 split the performance of the operation does n't have anything to do with determining how to divide the pie your partnership agreement determines that   how much have you each contributed and what agreement did you make before you decided to be partners if you have a poor performing business segment then the partnership should get together and consider adjusting or stopping that line of business   but you do n't change how the pie is divided because of it unless your partnership agreement says you do

this question was asked over at which is a site for quantitative analysts some of the finest minds in the business i am serious here the question the best answer was along the lines of a gambler generally gambles their own money a derivatives trader gambles using someone else 's   there is an important legal difference is that a gambling dept is normally considered a debt of honor that is not enforceable in a court of law whilst a derivatives contract is considered legally binding this last bit gets a bit interesting under some jurisdictions because only derivatives contracts involving the delivery of something physical are enforceable whilst contracts involving settlement with financial instruments are not so a stock index future would not be recognized

whether it 's historically stronger or weaker is n't going to have an impact on you the forex exposure you have is going forward if the exchange rates change you will have missed out on having more or less value by leaving it in a certain currency    ignoring fees say you exchange € 85 for $ 100 if while you 're in the us the euro gets stronger than it currently is and the exchange rate changes to € then you will lose out on € 5 if you try to change it back and the opposite is true if the euro gets weaker than it currently is you would gain money on exchanging it back   just look at it as though you 're buying dollars like it were a commodity   if the euro gets stronger it buys more dollars and you should 've held onto it in euros if it gets weaker it buys less dollars and you were better off having it in dollars   you would want to use whichever currency you think will be weaker or gain the least against the dollar while you 're here

your comment is more related to economics rather than finance you 're right that with conventional everyday goods that value is an entirely subjective thing economists formalize this idea with the notion that people 's preferences determine market prices   in finance though fundamental value relates to the value of the cash flows produced by a financial asset in terms we 're talking about exchange value what can i get if i take this bond stock and sell it the value i get should be equivalent to the monetary value of the cashflows produced by that asset over time discounting for uncertainty etc so fundamental value is a bit more objective in finance since these things produce something quasi objective cash

to avoid having it become overly complicated i suggest it be run as would a mutual fund mutual funds transact each evening to set a price transactions for purchases or sales are done at that price each evening   initially you have a dollar amount invested for each person you can calculate the percent of the fund each has and assuming the total is under $ 10 k 7 digits after the decimal accuracy is enough to track each share to the 1/10 cent   when new money is added that night you calculate the exact value of investments and add the new funds so each person now has a smaller share of the larger fund   if you wish you can normalize this to share value so my initial investment of $ 1000 is 100 shares regardless of the total amount invested then when new money comes in the shares increase as well this may feel better as a declining percent may just seem awkward even though that 's the case

but there 's that risk of me simply logging on to my online banking and transferring extra cash over if i cave in yep there 's no reasonable substitute for self control you could pay someone else to manage your money and dole out an allowance for your discretionary spending but that 's not reasonable for most people your money will be accessible to you you do n't need it inaccessible you need to change the way you think about your available money many people struggle with turning a corner when it comes to saving a tool that helps many is a proper budget plan ahead how all of your money will be used including entertainment if you want to spend £ 200/month on entertainment then plan for it in a budget and track your spending to help keep within that budget it 's a discipline thing but a budget makes it easier to be disciplined having a defined plan makes it easier to say i ca n't rather than i should n't but okay there are many budgeting tools just pick one that has you planning how all your money is spent you want to be proactive and plan for saving not hoping you have some leftover at the end of the month   here 's a good article on how and why to use a zero sum budget some people have envelopes of cash for various budget items and that can be helpful if you struggle to stick to your budget once the entertainment envelope is empty you ca n't spend on entertainment until next month but it wo n't stop you from blowing the budget by just getting more cash as you mentioned

navy federal credit union recently added this feature   it is free for members   making a deposit to their personal checking account though you have to be a member for at least 90 days to be eligible i have an all in one printer with scanner and availed myself of the service a couple of days ago   there was n't any additional software involved as everything was done through the web browser as shown the scan deposit demo   the only problem i had was figuring out how to align the check for it to be scanned completely had to place the check in the middle of the scanner aligned that was more of a hassle to figure out that one would suppose that was it   i immediately received an e mail confirmation that my deposit had been approved and processed while navy federal 's scan deposit faq is specific to them of course it is pretty comprehensive and gives one an idea of the general restrictions applied to the service

the minimum amount is set by the merchant services provider based on the kind of business its location and the history it mostly has nothing to do with you personally however the minimum amount differs based on the kind of credit cards being used for example foreign credit cards will require signatures on much lower amounts than domestic   in my local safeway analog of ralph 's the limit for domestic credit cards is set at $ 50 if your credit limit is $ 5000 you might think that its a 1 of your limit but if your limit is $ 50000 or $ 500 it will still be $ 50 you can not deduce anything about a specific person 's credit situation based on whether or not they are required to sign the receipt it has no affect on the decision

if you 're trying to hedge the ups and downs of your local residential real estate market a reit fund holding commercial properties across the country is not the ideal match here 's a comparison of an index tracking single family home prices in one region los angeles and vnq another popular reit fund   there 's some correlation but there 's clearly different magnitudes and sometimes different directions with a national home price index the correlation is only 68 and it would be lower for individual cities you could still use it for hedging but there 's significant tracker error risk to be considered unfortunately i 'm not familiar with any investment that would be a better match for individual residential markets so if you decide to use this i 'd also adjust the level of exposure to get a closer result e.g. using approx 50 vnq and 50 cash results in a closer result after 2 years compared to national single family home price changes than either 0 vnq and 100 cash or 100 vnq and 0 cash

i do n't think it 's hard but definitely not easy either it is very time consuming the hardest things is about how to apply the abstract strategies as example link building you will learn the difference between links how to get a and etc the problem is that you need most of the times to be creative and make your own strategy because sometimes that same strategy that you learn wo n't work in this case so because of that i believe you need a good amount of knowledge to know how to adapt and always make the most efficient strategy for that case    digital marketing have a lot to learn and different niches i would suggest you to pick one seo ppc sem email marketing content marketing video producing youtube marketing influencer marketing reputation management and more those one are some of the most popular but we have way more and many niches inside them   what i suggest is to choose one of them and found a good source of knowledge to learn the problem to learn by yourself is that it will take time to filter what is good and what is not and mostly people will give you a bad but content in order to sell you something in this market so be careful with scammers   hope it helped

if psychologically there is no difference to you between cash and debit you should test this over a couple of months on yourself and spouse to make sure then i suggest two debit cards one for you and spouse on your main or separate checking account if you use mint you can set budgets for each category envelope and when a purchase is made mint will automatically categorize that transaction and deduct that amount from the correct budget   for example if you have a fast food budget set at $ 100 per month and you use the debit at mcdonalds mint should automatically categorize it as fast food and deduct the amount from the fast food budget that you set   if it ca n't determine a category or gets it wrong you can just select the proper category mint has an iphone also android and windows phone app that i find very easy to use many people state that they do n't have this psychologically difference between spending cash and debit credit but i would say that most actually do especially with small purchases   it does n't have anything to do with intellect or knowing that you are actually spending money   it has more to do with and the physical act of handing over cash   you may not add that soda and candy bar to your purchase if you have visible cash in your wallet that will disappear more quickly   i lived in germany for 2 years before debit cards were around or common   i 'm a sharp guy and even though i knew that i paid $ 100 for the 152 it still kind of felt like spending monopoly money especially considering that in the us we are used to coins normally being 25 cents or less and in germany coins are up to 10 almost $ 10 and are used more frequently than paper

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

you can not deduct commute expenses regarding your specific example something to consider is that if the standard of living is higher in san francisco presumably the wages are higher too therefore you must make a choice to trade time and some money for commuting costs for even more money in the form of higher wages for example if you can make $ 50 k working 2 hours away from sf or $ 80 k working in sf and it costs you $ 5 k extra per year in commute costs you still come out ahead by $ 25 k minus taxes if it ends up costing $ 20 k more to live in sf due to higher rent mortgage food etc some people choose to trade 4 extra hours of commuting time to put that extra $ 20 k in their pocket it 's sort of like having an extra part time job except you get paid to read watch tv sleep on the job assuming you can take a train to work

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

rebalancing has been studied empirically quite a bit but not particularly carefully and actually turns out to be very hard to study well   the main problem is that you do n't know until afterward if your target weights were optimal so a bad rebalancing program might give better performance if it closer to optimal weights even if it did n't do an efficient job of keeping near the target weights in your particular case either method might be preferred depending on a number of things you can see why there is n't a generally correct answer to your question and the results of empirical studies might very wildly depending on the mix of assets and risk tolerance   still if your portfolio is not too complicated you can estimate the costs of the two methods without too much trouble and figure out if it is worthwhile to you edit in response to comment below your example gets at what makes rebalancing so hard empirically but also generally pretty easy in practice   if you were to target 75 equity 25 bonds and look at returns only for 30 years the best rebalancing method would be to never rebalance and just let 75 equity go to near 100 as equity has better long term returns   this happens when you look only at returns as the final number and do n't take into account the change in risk in your portfolio in practice most people that are still adding or subtracting in retirement to a retirement portfolio are adding removing a significant amount compared to the total amount in their portfolio   in the case you it is cheaper massively cheaper in the presence of load fees just to use new capital to trade toward your target keeping your risk profile   new money should be large enough to keep you near enough your target   if you just estimate the trading costs fees in both cases i think you 'll see just how large the difference is between the two methods this will dwarf any small differences in return over the long run even if you ca n't trade back all the way to your target

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor to answer the question directly not much short of investing in something at the exact moment before it goes bananas then reinvesting into a bigger stock and bigger etc it 's super high risk a better way is to sacrifice some small things less coffee less smokes less going out partying so that instead of having $ 100 you have $ 100 a week this puts you into a situation where you can save enough to become a deposit on an appreciating asset choose your own asset class property in au for me take out a loan for as much as you can for your $ 100 a week payment and make it interest only with an offset against it distributions from shares can either be reinvested or put into the offset or in the case of property rent can be put against the offset pretty soon you end up with a scenario where you have cash offsetting a loan down to nothing but you still have access to the cash invest into another place and your asset you can take out any equity that has grown and put that also into your offset keep pulling equity and using the money from the offset as deposits on other assets it kind of works really well on property and within 15 years you can build an empire with a passive income to retire on the biggest thing the rich guys get that the poor guys do n't is that debt is good use someone else 's money to buy an appreciating asset then when you pay it back eventually you own the growth use debt to buy more debt for exponential growth of course you need to also invest your time to research what you are investing in you need to know when you make the decision to buy that it will appreciate it 's no good just buying off a tip you may as well drop your money on the horses if you want to play it like that fortunately one thing we all have in common regardless of our money is time we have time which we can invest

when you add points a break even date comes into play that date varies depending on the rate and number of points as an approximate example having one point at those rates would have a break even point of about 5 years at that time the amount you save with the lower rate makes up for the extra cash you paid for points after that you are saving money if you do n't plan on having the loan that long the points are not worth it also you need to calculate the break even date based on your own parameters i suggest searching for an online calculator or spreadsheet that supports point calculations you may also be able to deduct of your points every year ask you accountant about that

i 'm sorry you are going through this but what you are dealing with is exactly is how cosigning works   it is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100 prepared to pay the loan on their behalf unfortunately the main benefit to cosigning a loan is to the bank they do n't care who makes payments only that someone does it is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in what your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is the biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you can not force your friend to do anything if it is for a car your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling guidance on this sort of thing look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there you can sue your friend in small claims court but keep in mind it also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income while it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court if it 's for $ 500 it probably is n't worthwhile but if your friend just stopped paying off their $ 30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it even though they can pay for it themselves

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

i am not going to discuss legality because with family members you are able to give a lot of guidance and assistance without running into legal issues   the biggest problem is that when they transfer the funds to you and you invest the money all the tax rates and tax limits are determined by your situation plus you have more investments than you should have so you hit those limits and brackets quicker for example in the united states a person can put $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 into a ira or roth ira each year if you combine the funds for three with your funds then you are giving up three quarters of the amount that you can invest in that type of account the decision regarding roth or not depends on age and income level but now their decision is related to what is best based on your situation the ability to even deduct ira deposits would be based on your situation of course for taxable accounts the tax rate is determined by your income not theirs if they want you to have the ability to make investment decisions for them then power of attorney is the way to go the money is deposited in their name and all the rules and tax rates are determined by their situation you make sure they have all the information they need to login and review the accounts but you make the all the moves within and between accounts

sounds like a terrible situation the only thing i can think of if you have the cash for it is to pay down enough of the mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses on the one hand this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now on the other hand every time you make an interest payment you are burning the smaller amount of money with no hope of seeing it back ever if you do n't have the cash or you find that just throwing away money then i would get out as fast as i can every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest if you sold at $ 300,000 you would have only a $ 30,000 debt to manage the total amount it would take to pay that off at anything resembling normal interest rates would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing of course if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on then you might want to hold on personally i would not make that bet all around a terrible situation i wish you lots of luck in resolving it

do you mean how much income tax the irs will assess loans are not income therefore they do not incur income tax so as long as the money is n't being given but being loaned you do n't have to pay income tax on it and just in case you think there 's a loophole of instead of paying my workers i 'll just loan them their paychecks and then forgive the debt at the end of the year no the irs does consider loan forgiveness to be a form of income so you need to look at whether the loan is going to you or whether your business is a separate legal entity that is getting the money if it 's a capital contribution then you are selling a stake in your company or more precisely as long as the money is going into the business the company is selling a stake in itself in that case there generally is n't tax owed here 's a question that touches on this

having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole built a budget to get a better view of what spending is i can say what the greatest gift it brings is it 's a decision tool when you are spending out of only one account you often make decisions based on the total money in the account should we go out for dinner can i make this impulse purchase this is terrible because many if not all of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries bills etc you ca n't see how many of those dollars are discretionary a budget is like having many accounts instead of looking at your real account(s to make spending decisions you look at your budget lines you to want impulse buy a gadget do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line if yes the decision is yours if no the budget is telling you that you do n't have dollars for that similarly for more purchases you want to splurge on some non staple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe and the budget line for groceries will tell you if you can do that instead of looking at e.g. $ 6000 in a chequing account you 're looking at $ 600 assigned $ spend = $ available in a monthly groceries budget line just like you can now see where your money has been going by maintaining and using your budget lines and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned total spent and total remaining you can continue to see where your money is going in near real time you 're no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out what 's going on and plan you 're looking at money flows and future intentions as you should be this approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances so that 's what a budget is for real time spending decision making control over your money which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart and guilt free spending in more categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend a budget line with insufficient funds does n't actually take the decision entirely away from you though if a budget line does n't have funds to spare for a given purchase you can still make the purchase but now you 're also making the decision to go and revise your budget taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line you 've overspent to keep the budget accurate

most etfs are index funds meaning you get built in diversification so that any one stock going down wo n't hurt the overall performance much you can also get essentially the same index funds by directly purchasing them from the mutual fund company to buy an etf you need a brokerage account and have to pay a transaction fee buying only $ 1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money you want to keep such fees way down below 0.1 pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios   or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company this generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up if you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging no matter what kind of account you are using keep doing that even if the market values are going down especially if the market values are going down   if you can keep doing this then forget about certificates of deposit at current rates you can not build wealth with cds

there is no formula that can be applied to most variations of the problem you pose   the reason is that there is no simple fixed relationship between the two time periods involved the time interval for successive payments and the time period for successive interest compounding suppose you have daily compounding and you want to make weekly payments a case that can be handled   say the quoted rate is   4.2 per year compounded daily then the rate per day is or so in one week a debt would grow through seven   a debt of $ 1 would grow to 1 or so the equivalent interest rate for weekly compounding is now you have weekly compounding and weekly payments so the standard annuity formulas apply the problem lies in that number 7 the number of days in a week   but if you were trying to handle daily monthly or weekly quarterly what value would you use in such cases the most practical method is to convert any compounding rate to a daily compounding rate and use a spreadsheet to handle the spaced payments

i hope i 'm misunderstanding your plan you want to invest in a way that will make so much that you pay back all of the loan payments with investment gains like the answer i gave on the preceding question and like @littleadv 's comment mhoran 's answers do n't do this no good will come of it   this strategy requires higher returns but does not necessarily give you a better return    but because you asked the question again let me specify what you 're missing i do think that learning is a good thing it boils down to two very significant problems that you have n't addressed   1 where are you getting your monthly income from   2 realistic vs. how big do any gains have to be and does that exist in the real world in a way that you can capture   in a nutshell if my answer to the last question showed that it 's crazy to invest and pay back out of your capital and income since you 're trying to keep your capital and only pay back with monthly gains this one will require even higher and thus more unrealistic gains   the model you 're implying   if that 's what you mean with this model which i think you do then here are my two very key questions again how are you getting your monthly income financial investments i.e. stocks or bonds will have two components of value one component of value is the stream of payments such as a monthly dividend from stocks that pay those or the interest payment from a bond the other is the ability to resell a security to another investor receiving back your capital   so you either have to find stocks that pay > 52 returns tax free each year and pay this loan off with the payments or higher returns to cover taxes but these kinds of investments do not exist for you   or you can try to invest in something pray that it goes up per month and so that you can sell it pay back your loan payment with the proceeds and use the capital to buy your next investment that will go up per month to turn and sell it again   the pros that do model this type of speculation go into much more depth than you are capable of they build models that incorporate probabilities for rates of return based on historical data they have better information and have specialized in calculating this all out they even have access to better investment opportunities like pre ipo twitter or private notes you just wo n't find the opportunities to make this happen each month for 24 months again you wo n't find them they do not exist for you in as an investor in securities realistic vs. so clearly i hope that by now i have convinced you that these would be the required returns they simply are n't available to you if they were you would still run into obstacles with converting book returns into physical money that you could repay the loans with and then continuing that growth   and while i appreciate the notion that if i could just make the payments each month i 'd have $ 10,000 after 24 months i guarantee you that you 'll be better off finding another way to target that same investment   along the lines of what mhoran said if you aim for a basic 401 k or other similar investment account and target it into the s&p500 you might see returns of anywhere from to + 25 over the next 24 months but if things went like they tend to average for the s&p500 it 's more like annually check out a savings target calculator like this one from bankrate.com and put in the numbers if you can save about $ 390 a month you 'll be at $ 10 k in 24 months it 's not as fun as the other but you can actually expect to achieve that   you will not find consistent > 50 returns on your money annually

there are two scenarios that i see you have a mortgage on the property generally the insurance company sends the funds to the lender who then releases the funds to you   as you make the repairs they do it this way because if you never make the repairs the value of the collateral is decreased and the lender wants to protect their investment there is no mortgage you will get the funds directly and the insurance company will not force you to make the repairs especially if the repairs are cosmetic in nature   in either case if you do n't fix the cause of the leak and make repairs to the site around the leak you will run into a problem in the future if the leak continues or the rot and mold continues to spread   if you file a future claim they are likely to ask for proof of the original repair if you did n't make it they are likely to deny the second claim they will say the cause is the original incident and if you had made the repair the second incident would n't have happened they are likely to drop you at that point if you try to sell the house you will have to disclose the original leak and the potential buyers will want you to make the repairs any mold or rot spotted by the home inspector will be a big issue for them it is also likely to be an item that they will be advised to demand that you get a legitimate company to make the repair before the deal can move forward and wo n't negotiate a lower price or a credit for $ x so they can get the repair done some will just cancel the deal based on the inspection report

capping the upside while playing with unlimited downside is a less disciplined investment strategy vis a vis a stop loss driven strategy whether it is less risky or high risky also depends on the fluctuations of the stock and not just long term movements for example your stop losses might get triggered because of a momentary sharp decline in stock price due to a large volume transaction esp more so in small cap stocks although the stock price might recover from the sudden price drop pretty soon causing a seemingly preventable loss that being said playing with stop losses is always considered a safer strategy it may not increase your profits but can certainly cap your losses

the problems of the government watching your money only apply to paper cash money which has pictures of presidents on it and it 's for anti laundering anti crime drug reasons nobody cares who you write a $ 100,000 check to   the paper trail is there but nobody ever looks at it no reputable money management firm would even want cash the of money would be a nightmare for them they 'd need to count it in front of you guard it call in a security firm to transport it and then make the same exact to the government that you have to make which means chain of custody they 'd have to give you the same your bank just gave you   they would strongly discourage cash for those reasons    so the crook wants the paper bag o cash because he plans to do none of those things he plans to take it from you and does n't want a paper trail   often when the financial industry uses the term cash it 's a slang for checks money orders cashiers checks savings bonds and other things that instantly map to denominated us dollars or a foreign currency routinely traded like yen pound franc or euro   the opposite of cash would be stocks bonds real estate holdings patents debt vehicles etc where they must be sold to make them into usd    just as a warning most financial management firms rip you off they pretend to be cheap or free but actually earn their pay through deception they talk you into fairly mediocre investments which pay them a huge sales commission sure your money goes up but not half as much as it should 've and they pocketed the difference   they also recommend products which are unnecessarily complex as a snow job   investment is simpler than that

i have had a couple of businesses do this to me   i simply ask them to come over to talk about the bill   sometimes this ends it   if they come over then i call the cops to file a report on fraud   a lot of times the police will do nothing unless they have had a load of complaints but it certainly gets the company off your back   and if they are truly unscrupulous it does n't hurt to get a picture of them talking with the police and their van and then post the whole situation online you will see others come forward really quick after doing something like this

it 's generally the hype that blinds them unfortunately as rare as it happens on the scale of the fb ipo it should n't happen at all but then again if everyone was well educated informed and risk averse we would n't have losers in the market everyone ca n't keep winning forever

gt this data is 4 years more recent   gt   income tax again   surprise surprise   gt haha let 's see the numbers on property corporate estate or capital gains surely the 99 pull their fare share of those   nope they pay more than their fair   the bleak reality is that even among the 25 states and the district of columbia that have taken steps to reduce the working poor ’s tax share by enacting state most still require their poorest taxpayers to pay a higher effective tax rate than any other income group
