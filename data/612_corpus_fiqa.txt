i am not an accountant but i have a light accounting background despite being primarily an engineer   i also have a tiny schedule c business which has both better and worse years   i am also in the united states and pay us taxes   i assume you are referring to the us form 1040 tax return with the attached schedule c.   however little i know about us taxes i know nothing about foreign taxes you are a cash basis taxpayer so the transactions that happen in each tax year are based on the cash paid and cash received in that year   you were paid last year you computed your schedule c based on last year 's actual transactions and you paid taxes on that income you can not last years schedule c based on the warranty claim you might want to switch to an accrual accounting method where you can book allowances for warranty claims   it is more complex and if your business is spotty and low volume it may be more trouble than it is worth at this point you have two months to look for ways to shift expenses into next year or being income into this year both of which help offset this loss perhaps a really aggressive accountant would advise otherwise and remember i am not an accountant but i would take the and move on this article on legalzoom link here discusses how to apply a significant net operating loss nol in this year to the previous two years and potentially carry it forward to the next two years   this does involve filing amended returns for the prior two years showing this year 's nol   for this to be relevant your schedule c loss this year must exceed your other w2 and self employment income this year with other tests also applied perhaps a really aggressive accountant would advise otherwise and remember i am not an accountant but i would take the and move on

your desire to travel before starting work is smart and something you should do there are very few opportunities in life where you will have a chunk of time to do such travelling having said that your life plans may or may not pan out the way you expect ideally you 'd take the 0 apr for 18 months and max it out a 3 balance transfer bt fee breaks out to 1.5 apr but due in 1.5 years that 's a very good loan rate if you can pay it before the apr changes say you take 6 months to travel when you return you have one year to pay off your credit card bill calculate how much you will borrow and how much your monthly payments will be $ 1,500 across 12 months is $ 125 can you add that as a monthly expense what will your life circumstances be when you return from travel do you know what your income will be do you know what your expected expenses will be how much padding will you have for emergencies

is a really really good rate doubly so if it 's a fixed rate and so if the interest is tax deductible that 's about as close to free money as you 're ever going to get heck depending on what inflation does over the next few years it might even be cheaper than free so if you have the risk tolerance for it it 's probably more effective to invest the money in the stock market than to accelerate your student loan payoff you can even do better in the bond market my go to intermediate term corporate bond fund is yielding nearly 4 right now just remember the old banker 's assets shrink liabilities never shrink you can lose the money you 've invested in stocks or bonds and you 'll still have to pay back the loan and when in doubt you can usually assume you 're underestimating your risks if you 're feeling up for it i 'd say make sure you have a good emergency fund outside of your investment money something you could live on for six months or so and pay your bills while looking for a job and sock the rest into something like the vanguard moderate growth fund or a similar instrument vanguard 's just my personal preference since i like their style and by style i mean low fees but definitely feel free to consider alternatives you could also pad your retirement accounts and avoid taxes on any gains instead but remember that it 's easier to put money into those than take it out so be sure to double check the state of your emergency fund

if economic conditions are weakening i.e. unemployment rising business and confidence dropping etc you can expect interest rates and thus mortgage rates to drop if economic conditions are strengthening you can expect interest rates and thus mortgage rates to start rising as you are in the us and with official interest rates there at 0.25 there is not much room for these rates to fall further i am in australia with official interest rates at 3.75 and with the economic weakness in the us and europe and with china slowing down we can expect our rates to fall further over the next year regarding your timeframe of one to two weeks unless there is a decision on rates in the us in the next week i do n't think there would be much change especially with rates there at record lows you are probably best to shop around for the best rates now and refinance once you have found one you are happy with

to answer your question directly   you can investigate by using google or other means to look up research done in this area   there 's been a bunch of it here 's an example of search terms that returns a wealth of information i 'd especially look for stuff that appears to be academic papers etc and then raid the references section of those   look for stuff published in industry journals such as journal of portfolio management as an example if you want to try out different models yourself and see what works and what does n't this monte carlo simulator might be something you would find useful the basic theory for those that do n't know is that various parts of a larger market do not usually move in perfect but go through cycles one year tech might be hot the next year it 's healthcare   or for an international portfolio one year korea might be doing fantastic only to slow down and have another country perform better the next year     so the idea of re balancing is that since these things tend to be cyclic you can get a higher return if you sell part of a slice that is doing well e.g. sell at the high and invest it in one that is not buy at the low because you do this based on some criteria it helps circumvent the human tendency to hold on to a winner too long how many times have you heard someone say but it 's doing so well why do i want to sell now presuming trends will continue and they will lose out on future gains only to miss the peak and ride the thing down back into mediocrity   depending on the volatility of the specific market and the various slices using re balancing can get you a pretty reasonable lift above the market average for relatively low risk generally the more volatile the market such as say an emerging markets portfolio the more opportunity for lift i looked into this myself a number of years back the i came was that the most effective method was to rebalance based on need rather than time   need is defined as one or more of the slices in your portfolio being more than 8 above or below the average   so you use that as the trigger how you rebalance depends to some degree on if the portfolio is taxable or not   if in a tax deferred account you can simply sell off whatever is above baseline and use it to buy up the stuff that is below    if you are subject to taxes and do n't want to trigger any short term gains then you may have to be more careful in terms of what you sell   alternatively if you are adding funds to the portfolio you can alter how your distribute the new money coming into the portfolio in order to bring up whatever is below the baseline which takes a bit more time but incurs no tax hit   the other question is how will you slice a given market   by company size   by sectors such as tech finance industrial healthcare by geographic regions

most of the time you 're selling to other investors not back to the company the stock market is a collection of bid buy offers and asks sell offers when you sell your stock as a retail investor at the market price you 're essentially just meeting whatever standing bid offers are on the market   for very liquid stocks e.g. apple you can pretty much always get the displayed price because so many stocks are being traded however during periods of very high volatility or for low volume stocks the quoted price may not be indicative of what you actually pay   as an example let 's say you have 5 stocks you 're trying to sell and the bid side order book is 2 stocks for $ 105 2 for $ 100 and 5 for $ 95 in this scenario the quoted price will be $ 105 the best bid price but if you accept market price you 'll settle 2 for 105 2 for 100 and 1 for 95 after your sell order goes through the new quoted price will be $ 95 for high volume stocks there will usually be so many orders near the midpoint price $ 105 in this case that you wo n't see any price slippage for small orders   you can also post limit orders which are essentially open orders waiting to be filled like in the above example they ensure you get the price you want but you have no way to guarantee they 'll be filled or not   edit as a cool example check out the bitcoin on coinbase for a live example of what the order book looks like for stocks you 'll see that the price of bitcoin will drift towards whichever direction has the less dense order book e.g. price upwards when there are far more bids than asks

your only real alternative is something like t bills via your broker or treasurydirect or short term bond funds like the vanguard short term investment grade fund   the problem with this strategy is that these options are different animals than a money market you 're either going to subject yourself to principal risk or lose the flexibility of withdrawing the money a better strategy imo is to look at your overall portfolio and what you actually want if you have $ 100k in a money market and you are not going to need $ 100k in cash for the future you are paying via the low yield for flexibility that you do n't need if get your money into an appropriately diversified portfolio you 'll end up with a more optimal return if the money involved is relatively small doing nothing is a real option as well $ 5,000 at 0.5 yields $ 25 and a 5 return yields only $ 250 if you need that money soon to pay tuition use for living expenses etc it 's not worth the trouble

you may want to move money between your investments within the plan rebalancing money to maintain your diversification you do n't have to deal with the details if selling and buying just tell them how much to move where many plans offer investments that automatically rebalance for you such as target date accounts you may be able to select one of those and just ignore the 401k until retirement or at most rebalance even less often look at what 's offered look at what it costs as fees run the numbers and decide whether you can do better

shares are tanking because   1 amazon is having some impact   2 the market for the last 10 years at least to fucking everything that happens   3 a lot of retailers over expanded a large amount of the stores retailers are have been poor performers amazon is what pushed it all over the edge but it will be fine brick and mortar is n't going anywhere in the long term a lot of people enjoy going out and shopping as well as the instant gratification of immediately getting what they paid for there are also plenty of brick and mortar stores that give you customer service and more importantly knowledge that amazon ca n't dream of they 're just not shitty retail giants like best buy    4 a lot of retailers in competitive segments particularly things like fashion failed to innovate fast enough they will be replaced by other retailers that meet market desires better which in turn may ultimately meet the same fate the other prominent cycle in retail is the shift from malls to strip malls to outlet centers etc it 's just like fashion to be honest    5 i remain concerned about the future of amazon 's foundation the review system gaming the review system is possible now and to be frank i would n't be shocked if a leadership change at amazon eventually compromises the integrity of the review system by getting in on it

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

if the investments are in a non retirement taxable account there 's not much you can do to avoid short term capital gains if you sell now ways to limit short term capital gains taxes donate you can donate some of the stock to charity before selling it transfer you can give some of the stock to say a family member in a lower tax bracket but there are tons of rules gift limits and wo n't work for little kids or full time students they would still pay taxes at their own rate protect your gains by buying puts wait it out until the long term capital gains rate kicks in this allows you to lock in your gains now but you wo n't benefit from potential future appreciation buying puts also costs $ so do the roi calculation you could also sell a call and buy a put at the same time and lock in your gains for certain but the irs often looks at that as locking in the short term capital gain so be careful and talk to a tax professional if you are considering that method die there 's a step up basis on capital gains for estates source

to answer your question as clarified in a comment all i wanted to know what will happen if i enter my debit card number in the sixteen digit account number they offer on the application for balance transfer that 's all almost certainly subject to the particular terms and conditions of the offer no money will move the only question is exactly when and how they will say no if you do it online and their system is clever enough to look up the the first six digits of the card number you enter their system might learn straight away that you   have entered a debit card number eg a card starting is a bank of ireland debit card otherwise you 'll have to wait until the request goes to their back office system which will eventually lead to the card issuer 's system being contacted at which point it will become clear that it 's a debit card and your transfer request will be refused at that point that said some credit card companies do offer a money transfer aka super balance transfer which is an offer to transfer money directly into a bank account putting the resulting debt on the credit card i 've never seen these offered without having to call a service centre and talk to a person though presumably so that they can check that the details they have for you about income etc are still correct

while i agree with this i also think a tiny fraction of that mentality comes from the simple notion that you can find a desk job that pays great so why work a hard manual job that also pays great    take the average worker and tell them you can do manual labor for $ or you can do a desk job for $ most people will pick the desk job for obvious reasons so it 's not just the belief that certain jobs are below them although that is most of it but the simple notion that we were sold over the last 30 years that desk workers in cubicle farms can make as much money as someone working a labor manual job so go for the desk job

as mentioned in the comments there are costs associated with owning living in an apartment first you have to pay maintenance charges on a monthly basis and perhaps also property tax find out the overall outgoings when you live in that apartment add the emi payments to the bank it should not be way higher than your current rent as an advantage you are getting an asset when you buy an apartment rent is a complete loss least financial terms so real estate is in general a good idea over paying rent as for the loan part personal loans are by far the most expensive of loans as they are in general unsecured loans but do check with your bank one way is to try and get a student loan which should be cheaper if you can borrow from family that is the best option you could return the money with perhaps bank fixed deposit rates it is better to pay family interest than bank if none of the options are workable then personal loan is something you need to look at with a clear goal to pay it off as soon as possible and try to take it in stages as an when you require it and if possible avoid taking all the at once

let 's say i have $ 10,000 and i invest said monies in mutual fund    at $ 100/share effectively giving me 100 shares now let 's    assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now    $ 10,500 at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest    monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit daily would be my answer as your investment unless you are selling shares or not re investing distributions is getting the following day 's change that impacts the overall return consider how if your fund went up 2 one day and then 2 another day from that $ 10,000 initial investment the first gain brings it up to $ and then the second makes it $ where the extra $ 2 is from the compounding the key though is that these are generally small movements that have to be multiplied together note also that if your fund goes up and down you may end up down overall given how the returns compound consider that your $ 10,000 goes up 10 to $ 11,000 and then down 10 to result in $ 9,900 as the return for up x% and down x% is which in this case is 1 as 10 of 10 is 1 the key is how long do you keep all the money in there so that the next day is applied to that amount rather than resetting back to the initial investment

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

we generally speak of the elasticity of demand cards are expensive because they can be we buy them in a weakened state and we do not buy them by the tonne there is also the concept of market segmentation but not so much essentially the price is determined by finding the point of pain and winding it back a little so people will pay $ 5 for a card   they will not generally pay $ 5,000 unless there is a good reason vanity why sell them for $ 2 the customers who at $ 5 tend not to even have $ 2 market segmentation again   in short the price is always going to need to be set before the point where demand rolls off sharply to maximise profit

most of the money gained through pe is done through financial engineering deal structuring there are funds that are operationally focused which do make changes on the portfolio company level from what i have seen most people who are operationally focused do not achieve that much in the way of results picture it as consulting except that the results of your initiatives are actually important     as for turn there are funds that specialize in that golden gate capital comes to mind these are far more exciting investments but can be very frustrating if you want to look at it in terms of the public markets in pe are essentially levered value investments it is likely that you are n't going to change the business much but are actually just buying an out of favor business and waiting on the industry to bounce back     the argument that pe funds just gut companies and sell with the new higher operating profitability is somewhat flawed there is really only so much cost cutting you can do once you have fired staff or corrected a mistake you wo n't likely have more chances to gain from that original problem what people should be criticizing is that funds often cut capex and reinvestment to increase results at the expense of the future profitability of the company

first a clarification no assets are immune to inflation apart from inflation indexed securities like tips or inflation indexed gilts well if held to maturity these are at least close inflation causes a decline in the future purchasing power of a given amount and it certainly does n't just affect government bonds either regardless of whether you hold equity bonds derivatives etc the real value of those assets is declining because of inflation all else being equal for example if i invest $ 100 in an asset that pays a 10 rate of return over the next year and i sell my entire position at the end of the year i have $ 110 in nominal terms inflation affects the real value of this asset regardless of its asset class because those $ 110 are n't worth as much in a year as they are today assuming inflation is positive an easy way to incorporate inflation into your calculations of rate of return is to simply subtract the rate of inflation from your rate of return using the previous example with inflation of 3 you could estimate that although the nominal value of your investment at the end of one year is $ 110 the real value is $ + 10 3 = $ 107 in other words you only gained $ 7 of purchasing power even though you gained $ 10 in nominal terms this back of the envelope calculation works for securities that do n't pay fixed returns as well consider an example retirement portfolio say i make a one time investment of $ 50,000 today in a portfolio that pays on average 8 annually i plan to retire in 30 years without making any further contributions yes this is an over simplified example i calculate that my portfolio will have a value of 50000 1 + or $ that looks like a nice amount but how much is it really worth i do n't care how many dollars i have i care about what i can buy with those dollars   if i use the same rough estimate of the effect of inflation and use a 8 3 = 5 rate of return instead i get an estimate of what i 'll have at retirement in today 's dollars that allows me to make an easy comparison to my current standard of living and see if my portfolio is up to scratch repeating the calculation with 5 instead of 8 yields 50000 1 + or $ as you can see the amount is significantly different if i 'm accustomed to living off $ 50,000 a year now my calculation that does n't take inflation into account tells me that i 'll have over 10 years of living expenses at retirement the new calculation tells me i 'll only have a little over 4 years now that i 've clarified the basics of inflation i 'll respond to the rest of the answer   i want to know if i need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country 's currency failing as others have pointed out currency does n't inflate prices denominated in that currency inflate also a currency failing is significantly different from a prices denominated in a currency inflating if you 're worried about prices inflating and decreasing the purchasing power of your dollars which usually occurs in modern economies then it 's a good idea to look for investments and asset allocations that over time have outpaced the rate of inflation and that even with the effects of inflation still give you a high enough rate of return to meet your investment goals in real inflation adjusted terms if you have legitimate reason to worry about your currency failing perhaps because your country does n't maintain stable monetary or fiscal policies there are a few things you can do first define what you mean by failing do you mean to exist or simply falling in unit purchasing power because of inflation if it 's the latter see the previous paragraph if the former investing in other currencies abroad may be a good idea questions about currencies actually failing are quite general however and in my opinion require significant economic analysis before deciding on a course of action hedging i would ask the same question about my home 's value against an inflated currency as well would it keep the same real value your home may or may not keep the same real value over time in some time periods average home prices have risen at rates significantly higher than the rate of inflation in which case on paper their real value has increased however if you need to make substantial investments in your home to keep its price rising at the same rate as inflation you may actually be losing money because your total investment is higher than what you paid for the house initially of course if you own your home and do n't have plans to move you may not be concerned if its value is n't keeping up with inflation at all times you 're deriving additional satisfaction utility from it mainly because it 's a place for you to live and you spend money maintaining it in order to maintain your physical standard of living not just its price at some future sale date 1 i use dollars as an example this applies to all currencies

rather than rolling the 401(k to a new employer 's plan you should roll it into a traditional ira   you get more options for the money there 's no limit on how much you can roll over and you have more control over the money   if you do a direct rollover there 's no taxes or penalties involved i 'd recommend against taking any money out of the 401(k   with the numbers you give above it 's like borrowing money at interest which is pretty high and you 're sacrificing your future retirement   if you leave that money alone to grow with compounding you 'll have a lot more when you retire   if you 're not familiar with the concept of compound interest it 's worth reading up on the numbers will blow you away at the very least if you desperately need to get $ 3000 out of it take out just enough to net $ 3000 after taxes and penalties not quite $ using the numbers you give and do a rollover with the rest   at least that way you 're keeping more in the ira just over $ vs the $ 5000 in your proposed scenario overall i really recommend you find a way to accomplish your goals without touching your retirement savings

depends the short answer is yes hsbc for instance based in new york is listed on both the lse and nyse toyota 's listed on the tse and nyse there are many ways to do this both of the above examples are the result of a corporation owning a subsidiary in a foreign country by the same name a holding company which sells its own stock on the local market the home corporation owns the majority holdings of the subsidiary and issues its own stock on its home country 's exchange it is also possible for the same company to list shares of the same pool of stock on two different exchanges the foreign exchange usually lists the stock in the corporation 's home currency and the share prices are near identical or for a company to sell different portions of itself on different exchanges however these are much rarer for tax liability and other cost purposes it 's usually easier to keep american monies in america and japanese monies in japan by setting up two copies of yourself with one owning the other and move money around between companies as necessary shares of one issue of one company 's stock on one exchange are the same price regardless of where in the world you place a buy order from however that does n't necessarily mean you 'll pay the same actual value of currency for the stock first off you buy the stock in the listed currency which means buying dollars or yen or euros or gbp with both a fluctuating exchange rate between currencies and a broker 's fee one of those cost savings that make it a good idea to charter subsidiaries could you imagine millions a day in car sales moving from american dealers to toyota of japan converted from usd to yen with a forex commission to be paid second you 'll pay the stock broker a commission and he may charge different rates for different exchanges that are cheaper or more costly for him to do business in he might need a trader on the floor at each exchange or contract with a foreign broker for a cut of the commission

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

well the first one is based on the formula for continuously compounded present value while the second one is the periodically compounded variant   typically the continuously compounded models represent the ideal as the compounding period of time valued money shrinks towards zero and the discount rate or interest rate if positive stays constant over the time period examined the periodic equation 's results approach that of the continuously compounded equation those two assumptions a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real world finance virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest they also unless prohibited by contract accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more based on what financial markets are doing most often the calculation is periodic based on the average daily balance and an agreed rate that if variable is based on the average daily rate over the previous observed period so you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables you should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved stated alternately use the first form to predict the future use the second form in retrospect to the past

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

honestly i think the best thing the government could do at this point is to stop with stimulus spending and let the market pick the winners and losers the government is horrible at this because it just throws money where it makes sense politically not economically which is what got us into this mess in the first place   obama is repeating all of the same mistakes made by bush but to a larger degree when the dot com bubble burst bush amp greenspan artificially lowered interest rates to 1 and printed money to stimulate the economy the goal was not to create a housing bubble like what happened but rather to get people to invest in stocks again instead the people who had been bitten by stocks looked around and saw that housing had a history of increasing in value w/o nearly as much risk of loss so they invested in housing instead clinton 's and bush 's policies of guaranteeing loans to lower income families for the purpose of buying homes also contributed to this and the next thing you know housing prices boomed because there was a massive demand thus leading to the housing market crash of   but that 's not all you see because as people started to believe that their homes would increase in value by huge amounts they started spending more risking more on the stock market and generally going into massive debt because they felt wealthy   so in 2008 when the housing bubble crashed so did the stock bubble and the personal debt bubble leaving many home owners broke their retirement funds 401k 's and ira 's destroyed and without any means of paying their mortgages thus the rise in people losing their homes   what has obama 's policy been the same as bush 's policy but he printed more tripled our money supply in 3 years and lowered interest rates even more effectively to 0   what so many people do n't seem to understand is that printing money effectively steals money from the middle class it 's a hidden tax on our savings accounts if more people realized this they 'd be outraged luckily for the government most people are mindless sheep willing to buy into the political propaganda being pushed by the media

nice idea but you will have a potential problem state lawmakers have already considered this option i looked at this site saving for college because it include info for on all the plans for illinois it income tax recapture effective january 1 2007 rollovers from this plan to an out of state    program are included in illinois taxable income to the extent of prior    illinois deductions effective january 1 2009 nonqualified    distributions from this plan are included in illinois taxable income    to the extent of prior illinois deductions most of the states have similar wording when looking up the law the key word is recapture the reason why there is no recapture provision at the federal level is that there is no tax deduction on contributions the 10 penalty make it less likely that somebody would want to have nonqualified distributions if a state gives a tax deduction in the year of the contribution they want to demand that tax deduction back if the funds are not used for educational purposes generally there are of course provisions for scholarships death and disability

a real simple definition or analogy of present value would be the principal or loan amount being lent and the future value as being returning the principal along with cost of borrowing the is the interest you earn on present value the is the interest you pay on future value the first one is the or future value of a $ 1 the second one is the or present value of a $ 1 both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time this entails here e is the 's e   thus the interest factors turn to this the examples only considered a single repayment at future date now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $ 1 for n number of periods then the present value of all such periodic payment is the principal or amount you borrowed this is the sum of discounted periodic payments as   if we replace with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form this simplifies to   replacing for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $ 1 the future value of periodic payments in amount of $ 1 can be arrived at multiplying the by giving once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield to use as the effect rate is the and calculation for continuous compounding all the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of then the present value of a $ 1 would be as follow once again you would have to use if compounding frequency of interest is intra year now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount q per period to find the present value of series of payments p that increase or decrease per period by an amount q we would do the following calculations here and all of these calculations have been available in add in for finance and incrementally being offered as javascript financial functions library please note that the tad series of the financial functions library for various environments such as excel javascript php ruby and others are property of the author writing this post all of these libraries except one for excel are available for free for public use and the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the pv by as follows here

just to clarify short team goals long term goals long term goals are for something in future your retirement fund children ’s education etc short term goals are something in the near future your down payment for car house and holiday being planned first have both the long and short terms goals defined of you would need to review both these goals on a ongoing basis to meet the short term goals you would need to make short term investments having arrived at a short term goal value you would now need to make a decision as to how much risk you are willing also how much is required to take to take in order to meet your goal for example if you goal is to save rs 100,000 by for the car and you can easily set aside rs 8,000 every month you do n't really need to take a risk a simple term fixed deposit would suffice you to meet your goal on the other hand if you can only save rs 6,000 a year then you would need to invest this into something that would return you around 35 you would now need to take a risk stocks market is one option there are multiple types of trades day trades shorts options regular trades that one can do however the risk can wipe out even your capital as you do n't know these types of investments suggest you start with dummy investing using quite a few free websites is one such site you get pseudo money and can buy sell and see how things actually move this should teach you something about making quick gains or losses without actually gaining or loosing real money once you reach some confidence level you can start trading using real money by opening a trading account almost every other bank in india offers online trading linked to bank account never lose sight of risk appetite and revise if every now and then when you do n't have dependents you can easily risk money for potential bumper however after you have other commitments you may want to tone down   edit is one such site there are quite a few others as well that offer you to trade on virtual money try this for few months and you will understand whether you are making right or not

the p e ratio is a measure of historic the previous financial year earnings against the current share price if the p e is high this means that the market perceives a big increase in future earnings per share   in other words the perception is that this is a fast growing company   higher earnings may also equate to big increases in dividends and rapid expansion   on the other hand if the p e is low then there is a perception that either earnings per share are decreasing or that future growth in earnings is negligible   in other words low p e equates to a perception of low future growth and therefore low prospects for future payout increases possibly even decreases the market is rightly usually willing to pay a premium for fast growing companies

let me give you the benefit of my experience i paid a bunch of points 4 when i bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including why i wish i had n't 1 interest rates plummeted not as likely to happen today and i wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that i would have had over the life of the loan also it made me feel stupid for paying close to $ 5 k to knock 1 or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade 2 i did n't take into account that i 'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early and i did way early so even if i had n't refinanced the extra points were really a waste of money 3 in the us at least you ca n't always deduct all of the money you paid in points in the first year you may have to spread that deduction over several years 4 you are right about the alternative being better investing the points since the benefit of paying them is at most 1 2 on your loan you do n't even need a 6 7 return to make it a better deal to invest them however i get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that if you do n't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years or whatever the term of the loan is it 's easy to say that when you are talking but $ 5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done good luck with the new house

corporate profits are currently taxed twice once at the corporate level and a second time when the corporation 's owners get paid via dividends or capital gains    the alternative is simply to eliminate the corporate level taxation and raise the dividend and capital gains taxes back up to normal levels instead of 1 15 we 'd just have 1 45 or something

i am going to respond to a very thin sliver of what 's going on   skip ahead 4 years when buying that house is it better to have $ 48 k in the bank but a $ 48 k student loan or to have neither   that $ 48 k may very well be what it would take to put you over the 20 down payment thus avoiding pmi banks let you have a certain amount of non mortgage debt before impacting your ability to borrow it 's the difference between the 28 for the mortgage insurance and property tax and the total 38 debt service   what i offer above is a bit counter intuitive and i only mention it as you said the house is a priority i 'm answering as if you asked how do i maximize my purchasing power if i wish to buy a house in the next few years

i have about $ 1 k in savings and have been told that you should get into investment and saving for retirement early i make around $ 200 per week which about $ 150 goes into savings that 's $ 10k per year   the general rule of thumb is that you should have six months income as an emergency fund   so your savings should be around $ 5k   build that first    some argue that the standard should be six months of living expenses rather than income   personally i think that this example is exactly why it is income rather than living expenses   six months of living expenses in this case would only be $ 1250 which wo n't pay for much   and note that living expenses can only be calculated after the fact   if your estimate of $ 50 a week is overly optimistic you might not notice for months until some large living expense pops up    another problem with using living expenses as the measure is that if you hold down your living expenses to maximize your savings this helps both measures   then you hit your savings target and your living expenses increase   so you need more savings   by contrast if your income increases but your living expenses do not you still need more savings but you can also save more money   does n't really change the basic analysis though   either way you have an emergency savings target that you should hit before starting your retirement savings    if you save $ 150 per week then you should have around $ 4k in savings at the beginning of next year   that 's still low for an emergency fund by the income standard   so you probably should n't invest next year   with a living expenses standard you could have $ in savings by april 15th deadline for an ira contribution that appears in the previous tax year   that 's $ 5000 more than the $ 1250 emergency fund so you could afford an ira probably a roth that year    if you save $ 7500 next year and start with $ 4k in savings under the income standard for emergency savings that would leave you with $ 11,500   take $ 5500 of that and invest in an ira probably a roth   after that you could make a $ 100 deposit per week for the next year   or just wait until the end    if you invested in an ira the previous year because you decided use the living expenses standard you would only have $ 6500 at the end of the year   if you wait until you have $ you could max out your ira contribution   at that point your excess income for each year would be larger than the maximum ira contribution so you could max it out until your circumstances change    if you do n't actually save $ 3k this year and $ 7500 next year do n't sweat it   a college education is enough of an investment at your age   do that first then emergency savings then retirement    that will flip around once you get a better paying long term job   then you should include retirement savings as an expected cost   so you 'd pay the minimum required for your education loans and other required living expenses then dedicate an amount for retirement savings then build your emergency savings then pay off your education loans above the minimum payment   this is where it can pay to use the more aggressive living expenses standard as that allows you to pay off your education loans faster    i would invest retirement savings in a nice diversified index fund or two since maintaining the correct stock bond mix of stocks is less risky than investing in just bonds much less just stocks   investing in individual stocks is something you should do with excess money that you can afford to lose   secure your retirement first   then stock investments are gravy if they pan out   if they do n't you 're still all right   but if they do you can make bigger decisions e.g. buying a house    realize that buying individual stocks is about more than just buying an app   you have to both check the fundamentals which the app can help you do and find other reasons to buy a stock   if you rely on an app then you 're essentially joining everyone else using that app   you 'll make the same profit as everyone else which wo n't be much because you all share the profit opportunities with the app 's system   if you want to use someone else 's system stick with mutual funds   the app system is actually more dangerous in the long term    early in the app 's life cycle its system can produce positive returns because a small number of people are sharing the benefits of that system   as more people adopt it though the total possible returns stay the same   at some point users the app   all the possible returns are realized   then users are competing with each other for returns   the per user returns will shrink as usage grows    if you have your own system then you are competing with fewer people for the returns from it   share the fundamental analysis but pick your stocks based on other criteria   fundamental analysis will tell you if a stock is overvalued   the other criteria will tell you which undervalued stock to buy

i have money to invest where should i put it anyone who answers with give it to me i 'll invest it for you do n't worry needs to be avoided if your financial advisor gives you this line or equivalent fire him her and find another before you think about where you should put your money learn about investing take courses read books consume blogs and videos on investing in stocks businesses real estate and precious metals learn what the risks and rewards are for each and make an informed decision based on what you learned find differing opinions on each type of investment and come to your own conclusions for each i for example do not understand stocks and so do not seriously work the stock market   mutual funds make money for the folks selling them whether or not the price goes up or down you assume all the risk while the mutual fund advisor gets the reward if you find a mutual fund advisor who can not recommend the purchase of a product he does n't sell he 's not an advisor he 's a salesman investing in business requires you either to intimately understand businesses and how to fund them or to hire someone who can make an objective evaluation for you again this requires training i have no such training and avoid investing in businesses investing in real estate also requires you to know what to look for in a property that produces cash flow or capital gains i took a course read some books gained experience and have a knowledgeable team at my disposal so my wins are greater than my losses do not be fooled by people telling you that higher risk means higher reward risks that you understand and have a detailed plan to mitigate are not risks it is possible to have higher reward without increasing risk again do your own research the richest people in the world do not own mutual funds or iras or rrsps or tfsas they do their own research and invest in the things i mentioned above

as the answer from noted any expense you have before the hsa is established is not considered a qualified medical expense for an hsa distribution however it is important to note that since you now have the hsa established any medical expense you have from this point on is a qualified medical expense even if you do n't take an hsa distribution for it right away for example let 's say that you have a medical expense this year but you do n't take an hsa distribution to reimburse yourself right away   maybe it is because you do n't have enough money in your hsa to reimburse yourself at this time   you can reimburse yourself in the future for this expense   as long as you had an hsa in place when the expense was incurred it does n't matter if you wait to take the distribution

so a major problem with looking at historical stock data on these graphs is that they set the stock price based off of current market if i was to say look at entertainment cool in june of 2016 it would say that the stock as trading between $ 5 6 in reality it was between   but in august there was a reverse split so june 's value based on todays current share count would be about $ 5 6 per one share 1988 for home depot must have been a really bad year for them and because of all the splits they 've had over the years already screws that estimate of what one share is worth there 's a lot of variance in 1988 but you have to be looking at only 1988 87 and 89 really screws the the chart 's scale

believe it or not unless you directly contact an accountant with experience in this field or a lawyer you may have a tough time getting a direct answer from a reputable source   the reason is two fold   first legally defining in game assets is exceptionally difficult from a legal taxation stand point   who really owns this data   you or the company that has built the and manages the servers containing all of the data you can buy and sell what is effectively data on their servers but the truth is they own the code the servers the data your access rights etc and at any point in time could terminate everything within their systems   this would render the value of your accounts worthless as such most countries have overwhelmingly avoided the taxation of in game inventory because it 's not really   instead in game goods are only taxed when they are exchanged for local currency   this is considered a general sale   there may be tax codes in your region for the sale of digital goods   otherwise it should be taxed as sale a standard good with no special stipulations the bottom line is that you should n't expect to find much reliable information on this topic on the internet   law 's have n't been defined regarding in game content worth and taxing of sales and if you want to know how you should pay your taxes on these transactions you need to talk to a good accountant a lawyer or both

one of the things to consider is that most vanguard funds are very tax efficient that is they do n't throw off much in the way of cap gains or taxable dividends while they grow so if you do it right you wo n't have to pay much in the way of taxes on your investments even if they are in taxable accounts until retirement when at the very least you will have a lot more flexibility in managing your money and very likely be in a lower tax bracket roth is better if you are planning other types of investments but if you are planning to hold an efficient vanguard fund the difference is n't that bit

i 'll start by focussing on the numbers i highly recommend you get comfortable with spreadsheets to do these calculations on your own   i assume a $ 200 k loan the mortgage for a $ 250 k house scale this up or down as appropriate for the rate i used the current us average for the 30 and 15 year fixed loans you can see 2 things first even with that lower rate to go 15 years the payment required is 51 higher than with the 30 i 'll get back to that second to pay the 30 at 15 years you 'd need an extra $ 73 because now you are paying at a 15 year pace but with a 30 year rate this is $ to keep that flexibility these are the numbers   there are 2 camps in viewing the longer term debt there are those who view debt as evil the $ payment would keep them up at night until it 's gone and they would prefer to have zero debt regardless of the lifestyle choices they 'd need to make or the alternative uses of that money to them it 's not your house as long as you have a mortgage but they 're ok with the local tax assessor having a statutory lien and his hand out every quarter the flip side are those who will say this is the cheapest money you 'll ever see and you should have as large a mortgage as you can for as long as you can treat the interest like rent and invest your money   my own view is more in the middle look at your situation i 'd prioritize   in my opinion it makes little sense to focus on the mortgage unless and until the first 5 items above are in place the extra $ to go to 15 if it 's not stealing from those other items or making your cash flow tight go for it   keep one subtle point in mind risk is like matter and energy it 's not created or destroyed but just moved around those who offer the cliche debt creates risk are correct but the risk is not yours it 's the lender 's looking at your own finances liquidity is important you can take the 15 year mortgage and 10 years in lose your job the bank still wants its payments every month even if you had no mortgage the tax collector is still there to keep your risk low you want a safety net that will cover you between jobs illness new babies being born etc   i 've gone head to head with people insisting on prioritizing the mortgage payoff ahead of the matched 401(k deposit funny they 'd prefer to owe $ 75 k less while that $ 75 k could have been deposited pretax so $ 100 k for those in the 25 bracket and matched to $ 200k. do n't make that mistake

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

gt;why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering since that goes to helping the company but not for secondhand less necessary trading   because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company   we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money   there 's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income although the principal return is of course tax free federal and are taxed differently there is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits

your investment is probably in a collective investment trust these are not mutual funds and are not publicly traded i.e. they are private to plan participants in your company because of this they are not required to distribute dividends like mutual funds instead they will reinvest dividends automatically increasing the value of the fund rather than number of shares as with dividend reinvestment you mention the s&p 500 fund you have tracks closely to the s&p index keep in mind there 's two indexes you could be looking at without any new contributions your fund should closely track the total return version for periods 3 months or longer minus the expense ratio if you are adding contributions to the fund you ca n't just look at the start and end balances the comparison is trickier and you 'll need to use the internal rate of return look into the xirr function in excel google sheets are not strictly required to pay dividends but are strongly tax incentivized to do so and essentially all do

you can trade an index by using a contract for difference or cfd various brokers offer this method and the spreads are quite low they tend to widen outside of market hours and not all brokers offer the same spreads i would look for a broker that offers the lowest spread on the index you are interested in you should also do your due diligence and check they are regulated by the relevant authority   pertaining to their territory eg fsa for uk

supply and demand for a particular bond may be such that the market price exceeds the par value for the bond at maturity this is when you get a negative yield especially when volatility is high people will actually pay money to park it in treasuries for an amount of time but when compared to a > 25 vol in the equities market over that same period taking a 5 or less hit does n't sound nearly as bad

one idea if you came up with a model to calculate a fair price range for a stock then any time the market price were to go below the range it could be a buy signal and above the range it could be a sell signal there are many ways to do stock valuation using fundamental analysis tools and ratios dividend discount model peg etc see wikipedia stock valuation and while many of the inputs to such a fair price range calculation might only change once per quarter market prices and peer sector statistics move more frequently or at different times and could generate signals to buy sell the stock even if its own inputs to the calculation remain static over the period for multinationals that have a lot of assets and income denominated in other currencies foreign exchange rates provide another set of interesting inputs i also think it 's important to recognize that with fundamental analysis there will be extended periods when there are no buy signals for a stock because the stocks of many popular profitable companies never go on sale except perhaps during a panic moreover during a bull market and especially during a bubble there may be very few stocks worth buying fundamental analysis is designed to prevent one from overpaying for a stock so even if there is interesting volume and price movement for the stock there should still be no signal if that action happens well beyond the stock 's fair price otherwise it is n't fundamental analysis it 's technical analysis whereas technical analysis can by definition generate far more signals because it largely ignores the fundamentals which can make even an overvalued stock 's movement interesting enough to generate signals

there 's nothing much you can do here and i do n't think you 'll succeed in placing blame on the lawyers in order for ssa to have the tax withheld from your benefits you need to submit form here are the details on how to get it and what to do with it this form is voluntarily submitted i.e. no one will ask for it you have to actively send it out on your own as to repayment of the ltd benefits since they were not taxable there 's no change in the taxable income on your behalf what you got was n't taxed so what you gave back does n't provide any tax benefit as to why ssa benefits are taxable and ltd benefits are not this is because ssa is pre tax and ltd premiums were in your case apparently post tax however the ltd benefits management company does n't care or may be even know about this and they do everything they can to reduce their own liability to you if you 're entitled to ssa benefits it reduces their liability that 's why they insisted on your claim with ssa as to the ssa dragging their feet they want to reduce their taxpayers essentially liability as well however once they decided in your favor you received what was rightfully yours including back pay ssa benefits are taxable in the year received so you got a lump sum taxable as a lump sum sorry but that 's the way it is this is an example where post tax ltd premiums do n't actually pay off

i could be wrong but i doubt that bernie started out with any intention of defrauding anyone really   i suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else 's or at least not as high as he 'd promised his investors they 'd be so he the numbers and lied to get past the moment thinking he 'd just make up for it the next quarter   only that never happened and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things did n't improve as he expected it only turned into a ponzi because he was n't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere   bernie could n't admit the truth so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that did n't exist which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out   the source of that money turned out to be new investors who were in by people already investing with bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard and they had the checks to prove it i think this got so far out of hand and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes swallowing up everything that gets close had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then bernie might still be at it   the rapid downturns in the markets hit many of bernie 's investors with margin calls in other investments they held so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls expecting that all of the money he 'd convinced to leave with him really existed   when he realized he could n't meet the flood of redemptions that was when he up and the bubble burst could he have succeeded by simple investing in berkshire   probably   but then how many people say that in hindsight about them or amazon or google or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly grin   taking people 's money and parking it all in one stock does n't make you a genius and that 's how bernie wanted to be viewed   to accomplish that he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first   unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong and rather than taking his by admitting it to his investors his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that i 'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could   the problem was that moment never came keep in mind one thing   the $ 64 billion figure everyone cites is n't money that really existed in the first place   that number is what bernie claimed his fund was worth and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of   his actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $ 20 billion range over that time   everything else beyond that was nothing more than the returns he was claiming to get for his clients   it 's what they thought they had in the bank with him rather than what was really there

once again i offer some sage advice do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog michael offers an excellent method to decide what to do note he does n't base the decision on the tax implication   if you are truly indifferent to holding the stock you might consider selling just the profitable shares if that 's enough cash then sell shares at a loss each year if you have no other gains that will let you pay the long term gain rate on the shares sold this year but offset regular income in years to come but i 'm hard pressed to believe you are indifferent and i 'd use 's approach to decide   updated the new law is simply a rule requiring brokers to track basis your situation does n't change at all when you sell the shares you need to identify which shares you want to sell for older shares the tracking is your responsibility that 's all

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

the economic effect of a cfd from your point of view is very close to the effect of owning the stock if the stock goes up you make money if it goes down you lose money if it pays a dividend you get that dividend you 'll typically pay commission for buying and selling the cfds in a similar way to the commission on stock purchases though one of the advertised advantages of cfds is that the commission will be lower they also often have tax advantages for example in the uk you do n't have to pay stamp duty on cfds in theory you are exposed to credit risk on the cfd issuer which you are n't with the real stocks if the issuer goes bankrupt you may lose any money you have invested regardless of how well the stock has performed it 's certainly similar to a bet but not much more so than investing directly in the stock in practice the issuer of the cfds is likely to hedge its own exposure by actually buying the underlying stocks directly but they can aggregate across lots of contracts and they would tolerate some unhedged exposure to the stock so they can cut down on the transaction fees you also wo n't get the same voting rights as the underlying stock would grant you

as you mentioned in the title what you 're asking about comes down to volatility   dca when purchasing stock is one way of dealing with volatility but it 's only profitable if the financial instrument can be sold higher than your sunk costs   issues to be concerned with let 's suppose you 're buying a stock listed on the nyse called foo this is a completely fake example   over the last six days the average value of this stock was exactly $ 1   over six trading days you put $ 100 per day into this 2 at market close on january 11th you have shares of foo   you paid $ for it so your average cost before fees is $ = $ per share let 's look at this including your trading fees $ + $ 30 = $ 1.01 per share when the market opens on january 12th the quote on foo could be anything   patents customer wins wars politics lawsuits press coverage etc could cause the value of foo to fluctuate   so let 's just roll with the assumption that past performance is consistent selling foo at $ 0.80 nets $ 0.80 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ loss selling foo at $ 1.20 nets $ 1.20 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ profit every day that you keep trading foo those numbers get bigger assuming foo is a constant value   also remember even if foo never changes its average value and volatility your recoverable profits shrink with each transaction because you pay $ 5 in fees for every one speaking from experience it is very easy to paper trade   it is a lot harder when you 're looking at the ticker all day when foo has been $ 0.80 $ 0.90 for the past four days and you 're $ 300 under water on a $ 1000 portfolio   now your mind starts playing nasty games with you if you decide to try this let me give you some free advice unless you have some research such as support resistance information or data on why foo is a good buy at this price let 's be honest you 're gambling with dca not trading end notes

i think the answer depends on whether you 're trying to get out of debt and stay out or if you just want this card paid off   that is are you changing the way you deal with money and debt for good if you just want this card paid off and you 're ok with going back into debt later then scott 's advice is one way to go   i 'd personally be nervous about leaving myself with no cash reserves at all    if you are planning to get out of debt and stay out then you do n't want to put yourself in a position where you 're tempted to go back into debt as soon as you hit a speed bump   so you need some cushion so that an emergency does n't push you right back to the credit cards   if you 've got a budget that you can live on and that covers your usual expenses and your job is relatively stable then $ 1000 is probably enough of a cushion for most things you can then pay off most of the credit card using the rest of your savings   if you 're in an unstable job situation then you 'll want to keep more if not all of your savings as protection against the instability   once the situation then throw the surplus savings at the debt $ 1000 does n't cover all possible emergencies but it 's generally a good tradeoff between prudence and paranoia

you can definitely open an ira and roll the money over i suggest instead of trying opening online calling the institution and asking what would be the procedure in your specific case if not i will have to cash out my 401k. who do i contact to find out    if my country has some sort of deal with the us in regards to taxes i    would of course prefer to not pay the penalty 20 federal + 10    state tax and instead reinvest the money in a retirement fund in my    country us some times have listings of tax advisers who work with us expats in the countries they cover you can check for such a list on the website of your local us embassy these people will be able to answer this question however it is highly unlikely that you 'll be able to avoid the tax and penalty in the us in this scenario it is not likely that you could roll over into a foreign retirement fund from your country 's laws perspective but maybe your country has some solution for this

a growth fund is looking to invest in stocks that will appreciate in stock price over time as the companies grow revenues and market share a dividend fund is looking to invest in stocks of companies that pay dividends per share   these may also be called income funds in general growth stocks tend to be younger companies and tend to have a higher volatility larger up and down swings in stock price as compared to more established companies   so growth stocks are a little riskier than stocks of more established stable companies stocks that pay dividends are usually more established companies with a good revenue stream and well established market share who do n't expect to grow the company by leaps and bounds   having a stable balance sheet over several years and paying dividends to shareholders tends to stabilize the stock price lower volatility less speculation smaller swings in stock price   so income stocks are considered lower risk than growth stocks    funds that invest in dividend stocks are looking for steady reliable returns not necessarily the highest possible return they will favor lower more reliable returns in order to avoid the drama of high volatility and possible loss of capital funds that invest in growth stocks are looking for higher returns but with that comes a greater risk of losing value   if the fund manager believes an industry sector is on a growth path the fund may invest in several small promising companies in the hopes that one or two of them will do very well and make up for lackluster performance by the rest as with all stock investments there are no guarantees   investing in funds instead of individual stocks allows you invest in multiple companies to ride the average avoid large losses if a single company takes a sudden downturn   dividend funds can lose value if the market in general or the industry sector that the fund focuses on takes a downturn

gold is not debt money is debt whatever it is made of   in the example above everything could have been exactly the same except using certificates written on sharks instead of on paper    now sharks have value paper has value and gold has value when you print money the stuff you make it out of has some utility separate from its use as currency but when you are using it as currency regardless of what it is made from it is a marker for debt    you go to work for an hour your boss gives you a marker that you can trade for a cheeseburger or some gasoline or a or or whatever you want that marker is an iou for the work you did you give it to the store and it becomes an iou for the value of one they give it to the store employees or the grower or whatever and so on    it does n't matter what that marker is made out of its function is the same if it were gold you could melt it down and make a ring out of it if it 's paper you could use it as a bookmark or a shopping list or to blow your nose if it 's a shark you scare people with it in the pool   this is totally separate from the question of whether we should be using gold as a currency which has to do with the fact that the gold supply is a lot more stable than the paper supply and whether being able to easily print more money on demand is a good thing or a bad thing

if you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra funds which you would like to take some extra risk on then i say work yourself out a strategy plan get yourself educated and go for it if it is individual shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis technical analysis or some of both you can use fundamental analysis to help determine which shares to buy and then use technical analysis to help determine when to get into and out of a position you say you are prepared to lose $ 10,000 in order to try to get higher returns i do n't know what percentage this $ 10,000 is of the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments trading but lets assume it is 10 so your total starting capital would be $ 100,000 the idea now would be to learn about money management position sizing and risk management there are plenty of good books on these subjects if you set a maximum loss for each position you open of 1 of your capital i.e $ 1,000 then you would have to get 10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10 total loss you do this by setting stop losses on your positions i 'll use an example to explain say you are looking at a stock priced at $ 20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price you now need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to you can say well i may have been wrong on this occasion the stock price has gone against me so i need to get out now i put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker you may determine the stop price based on previous support levels using a percentage of your buy price or another indicator or method i tend to use the percentage of buy price lets say you use 10 so your stop price would be at $ 18 10 below your buy price of $ 20 so now you can work out your position size the number of shares to buy your maximum loss on the position is $ 2 per share or 10 of your position in this stock but it should also be only 1 of your total capital being 1 of $ 100,000 = $ 1,000 you simply divide $ 1,000 by $ 2 to get 500 shares to buy   you then do this with the rest of your positions with a $ 100,000 starting capital using a 1 maximum loss per position and a stop loss of 10 you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions if you use a larger maximum loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions to open i would not go higher than 2 maximum loss per position if you use a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you would have more positions to open the larger the stop loss the longer you will potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less time you will be in a position also as your total capital increases so will your 1 of total capital just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases using this method you can aim for higher higher return investments and reduce and manage your risk to a desired level one other thing to consider do n't let tax determine when you sell an investment if you are keeping a stock just so you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months then you are in real danger of increasing your risk considerably i would rather pay 50 tax on a 30 return than 25 tax on a 15 return

if you buy a townhouse you often are in a condominium arrangement in the us when you 're really in a in particular   so that 's a downside right away you have to have a hoa or at least some sort of common agreement though it might not have formal meetings   everyone who owns an interest in the entire group of townhouses gets some say in landscaping and such beyond that though townhouses and similarly are often easier to own as they do n't have as much maintenance that you have to do but more expensive because you pay someone to do it the landscaping the external repairs etc   you likely do n't have as much control over what the external looks like because you have to be in agreement with the other owners but you also do n't have to do the work unless your agreement is to collectively do the mowing landscaping which you should know in advance    i would n't underestimate the value of easier by the way it 's very valuable to not have to deal with as many repairs and to be able to go a week without thinking about mowing or watering   in that sense it can be a nice transition into ownership getting some but not all of the obligations   but if that 's something you really value doing the landscaping and mowing and whatnot that 's relevant too   you can always tell your realtor to look for townhouses where the owners do some all of the landscaping though that opens up a different can of worms where you rely on others to do work that they may not do or do well they 're also somewhat you may be sharing a wall but not necessarily air gap townhouses do exist and either way will be closer to your neighbors   does noise bother you   conversely are you noisy   in a college town this is probably something to pay attention to price wise of course stay well within your means if being close to the city center is important that may lead you to buy a townhouse in that area   if being further out is n't a problem you 'll probably have similar choices in terms of price as long as you look in cheaper areas for single family homes

you 're right to seek passive income and since you 're already looking for it you probably already know some of the reasons to why it is important    do you live in the united states if so i 'd strongly recommend purchasing your primary residence and then maybe investment properties if you like owning your own home   the us tax and banking structure is set up to favor this move in more ways than i can count so save save save then beg borrow and steal to get the down payment rent rooms to friends or random people to afford the payments buy a fixer upper in an up and coming neighborhood   the us is rife with these in all price ranges if you 're working 56 hrs a week you 've got the work ethic so if you ca n't afford it it 's probably because you 're spending all your money on other stuff if you want to do this it will take some effort and savings you will have to trim back the vacations dinners out etc etc etc   let your friends do that stuff and rent from you   your life will get continually easier if you have already trimmed back all the discretionary spending and still ca n't make it then you need to earn more money doing either and both of these things will absolutely change your whole economic life and future so in summary i 'd offer these   ranked priorities 1 learn to save unless you always want to have to work for someone else 2 increase your income capability since your most valuable asset is you 3 buy and hold real estate because the game is rigged to favor passive income i 'm 38 never earned a six figure salary made some good purchases when i was 25 30 and work is optional for me now

direct roll overs trustee to trustee transfers are typically initiated by the receiving institution therefore you need to work with vanguard they will have a form in which you provide them with your fidelity account info and they will then contact fidelity and initiate the transfer   do not take the option of being sent a check made out to you by fidelity an indirect rollover there are too many ways to up and get hit with penalties if you are the middleman in the process i believe in most if not all cases the irs now requires a 20 withholding on indirect 401k rollovers this is because too many times people would initiate a roll over but not complete it either at all or within the allowed 60 day window and then come tax time be unable to pay the tax and penalty on the distribution the tricky part of that withholding is that you still have to deposit that amount into the new account otherwise it becomes a distribution subject to tax and penalties and that means coming up with the money from other accounts so in summary talk to vanguard and set up an institution to institution transfer they souls make this very easy as they want your money and do not do any kind of rollover where you come into personal possession of the money   if the check is made out to vanguard but sent to you to to vanguard that should not be an issue as that is still a trustee to trustee transfer   fidelity may have a minor account closer fee that will be deducted from the value of the account before it is sent

run your credit reports for the 3 major agencies to find out which of them have the debt was reported on and initiate the dispute process with each agency that reports the invalid debt this will cause the person who put it on the report to either prove that it is valid or remove it from your report ignoring debt collector calls is not a good option regardless of whether the debt is valid they obviously think the debt is yours so their response is naturally to put it on your credit report in most cases it is a good idea to respond in writing that it is not your debt i doubt you have much recourse against the creditor for one thing they did try to contact you and you dodged them that is not their fault secondly it is unlikely you would prevail unless you could prove that they maliciously put false information on your credit or through gross incompetence did so more likely is that they are you to a debt from someone with a similar name or there is an accounting error somewhere or possibly you owe the debt and no one ever sent you a bill it happens with medical bills all the time

first of all you nit wit are a group of languages which includes arabic and the arabs by far outnumber you so i ca n't be anti semitic   how the jews have seemed to take the phrase semitic and coin anti semitic to mean a hatred of jews seems to me classic jewish misdirection you may rest assured i hate no language   now if you wish to speak about why i think the jews have been a plague on mankind through the centuries and always the root cause of strife and conflict i have many valid arguments to their display of despicable behavior starting with palestine and the apartheid regime the world looks away from in shame   right here in america we have the jewish control of the federal reserve and the treasury and banking system which continuously put us through the boom and bust cycle we have jews the white house and driving policies that are anti america and pro israel and the we can argue the subject for as long as you like   my point here was that the american people have become so blind and that america can be taken to war in iraq because israeli intelligence decided that they had wmd and it was a threat to israel syria is also a threat to israel and iran is also a threat to israel and so is afghanistan and of course pakistan and saudi arabia   from the looks of it israel and the jews seem to think a majority of the semitic world is out to destroy them so it would seem actually the pitiful few jews left over after the holocaust are actually the anti   and most surprising is the fact that the pitiful few jews actually grew in population during the course of wwii which would actually quite possibly with that rate of breeding make them rabbits thus i would have to plead guilty of being anti rabbits and thank the lord that rabbits have lots of natural predators or jews would grow as big as but fortunately the british had the foresight to not make israel in australia because while they took a pair of rabbits there in the 1700 hundreds look at their population now   we would have a serious jew population explosion on our hands and since they would then be a majority of the semitic languages would be forced to the rabbit population in australia using biological agents and the few potent ones left we could eat in what could later be called the big roast on the in the biggest act of antisemitism that never happened   i am afraid at this point i would like to take the phrase antisemitism back from you and suggest you use a phrase closer to what you are trying to say jew hater   as for me i absolutely hate fucking rabbits

if your payroll payments are the same each period you will generally have the same net pay per period   some things that can cause variations if your employer puts special payments in a specific paycheck such as a quarterly or annual bonus or a vacation payout this can increase the percentage held from that specific paycheck   the irs publishes lookup tables and your payroll system should withhold the amount in the lookup table    if you get a raise your new payroll withholding rate may increase based on the gross pay amount

if it is a well known company that wants to give you a refund i would not worry about giving them your credit card number   however i would never type my credit card number into an e mail message e mail messages are very insecure and can be read by many people along its way to the destination they also can be archived in many places meaning that your number will continue to be posted out there for someone to grab in the future   if you need to give this company your credit card number do it over the phone   having said that ultimately you are not generally responsible for fraudulent charges if your card number is stolen and misused i 've had so many fraudulent charges despite my being relatively careful with my number that i do n't really worry much anymore about losing my number i just check my statement for false charges and when they happen   the bank cancels the charge and issues me a new number it has happened to either my wife or i maybe 5 times over the last two years

gold has value because for the most of the history of mankind 's use of money gold and silver have repeatedly been chosen by free markets as the best form of money gold is durable portable homogeneous fungible divisible rare and recognizable    until 1971 most of the world 's currencies were backed by gold   in 1971 the us government defaulted on its obligation to redeem us dollars by which most other currencies were backed in gold as agreed to by the bretton woods agreement of 1944   we did n't choose to go off the gold standard we had no choice foreign central banks were demanding in gold and the us did n't have enough we inflated too much    i think that the current swell of interest in gold is due to the recent massive increase in the federal reserve 's balance sheet plus the fast growing national debt plus a looming social security medicare crisis   people are looking for protection of their savings and they wish to opt out of the government bail outs government deficits government run health care and government money printing   they are looking for a currency that does n't have a counter party gold is money and nothing else jp morgan in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold if everyone decided for example to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists toward the gold standard alan greenspan

this will be a complex issue and you will need to sit down with a professional to work through the issues when the house was put up for rent the initial year tax forms should have required that the value of the house property be calculated this number was then used for depreciation of the house this was made more complex based on any capital improvements if the house was n't the first he owned then capital gains might have been rolled over from previous houses which adds a layer of complexity   any capital improvements while the house was a rental will also have to be resolved because those were also depreciated since they were placed in service the will be recaptured and will be a part of the calculation you have nowhere near enough info to make a calculation at this time

taking out your equity when refinancing means that you take out a new loan for the full value of your house perhaps less 20 as a down payment on the new mortgage otherwise you 'll be paying insurance pay off your old lender and keep the rest for yourself the result is much the same as using as a heloc or home equity loan or a second mortgage except it 's all rolled into a single new mortgage the advantage is that the interest rate on a first mortgage is going to be lower than on heloc or equivalent and the equity requirements may be lower e.g. a heloc may only let you borrow against the amount of equity that exceeds 25 or 30 while a new mortgage will require you only to have 20 equity   this is especially attractive to those whose homes have appreciated significantly since they bought them especially if they have a lot of high interest debt e.g. credit cards they want to pay off of course rolling credit card debt into a 30-year mortgage is n't actually paying it off but the monthly payments will be a lot lower and if you 're lucky and your home appreciates further you can pay it off fully when you sell the property and still have paid a lot less interest the downside is that you have turned unsecured debt into secured debt which puts your home at risk if you find yourself unable to pay in your case you do n't yet have even 20 equity in your home so i would n't recommend this   equity is simply the difference between the amount you still owe on your home and the amount you 'd get if you were to sell it until you do sell it this amount is tentative based on the original purchase price and perhaps an intervening appraisal that shows that the property has appreciated that is really all that it is and there 's nothing magic about it except that since you own your home you have equity in it while as a renter you would not it used to be decades ago when you needed 20 down to get a mortgage that selling was the only time you 'd be able to do anything with the equity in your home now you can take it out as described above or borrow against it thanks to various financial products it is sometimes tempting to consider equity roughly equivalent to profit but some of it is your own money contributed through the down payment your monthly principal payment and improvements you have made so cashing out is n't all profit it 's partly just you getting your own money back and there are many additional expenses involved in owning a home such as interest property taxes maintenance utilities and various fees not to mention the commissions when you buy or sell which the equity calculation does n't consider increasing equity reflects that you own a desirable property in a desirable location that you have maintained and maybe even improved it that you are financially responsible i.e. paying your mortgage taxes etc and that your financial interests are aligned with your neighbors all those things feel pretty good and they should otherwise it is just a number that the banks will sometimes let you borrow against

1 link 2 it does n't matter if they can or do what matters is if they are investing not trading in it more than banks are investing in businesses if that is the case it is then businesses as a whole will see the inflation first and commodities will be playing the entire time but mostly when the investments hit recession   i will invest in the market again after they lose their invested value in historical terms the best time was to invest in them was 1980 1938 and 1900 and the best time to get out was 1929 1960 's and 2000 but to bet against them right now with the dollar is meaningless because the fed is deflating the currency as they go down so it 's like running on a treadmill by holding silver i am essentially short the market only difference is instead of holding a devaluing currency cash i 'm holding a real money which is increasing in value   there 's nothing simpler than investing in commodities for the long term people lose when they are making monthly daily trades in them anyone who bought and held on to gold in 2000 did it for $ 300 and they 've made infinitely more than the majority of people investing in blue chips because they 've lost value and much more than those who invested in bonds and that trend is n't going to stop unless the government lets the dollar deflate in which case the dollar will come to gold instead of the other way around until they are in equilibrium again historically the dow has an average of being 2 ounces of gold peaking at 50 and at .5 if it hits .5 again like it has everytime this occurs in the past then either gold will be $ 20000 or the dow will be 4000 you pick

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

as discusses tax bracket without any refers to a single jurisdiction 's marginal tax rate   in your case this is either your california 's tax bracket or your federal tax bracket not including marginal social security and medicare taxes   but if someone says combined state and federal tax bracket they probably mean the combination of your state and federal income tax brackets again lot including sales taxes business and occupational taxes social security taxes and medicare taxes   the math to combine the state and federal marginal tax rates is a bit tricky because most people can deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes when computing their income for federal income tax purposes   the federal alternative minimum tax restricts this deduction for some people for a single person earning $ 100,000 of salaries and wages in california whose state income taxes are close to their standard deduction the calculations for the combined marginal income tax rate look something like this as mentioned above this the tax bite on marginal earned income   to find the true marginal rate we need to add in social security taxes medicare taxes sales taxes and business occupation taxes   the social security and medicare taxes are sometimes called self employment taxes   this math unemployment insurance and workers compensation insurance because those taxes are typically capped well below $ 100,000 per year of income   this math also b o taxes because this question is california specific if an employer wishes to increase an employee 's pay by $ the first $ will go to the employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the remaining $ 1,000.00 will be subject to the combined marginal income tax rate discussed above plus will have $ go to the employee 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the employee might buy some extra things with some of their extra money and pay sales tax on them in 2016 a 9 sales tax rate was common in california 's largest cities the irs estimated that for a single person with no dependents making $ 100,000 per year who did not buy a boat rv motor vehicle or major home construction about 9 of their marginal gross income was subject to sales tax

i am currently in the process of purchasing a house i am only putting 5 down i see that some are saying that the traditional 20 down is the way to go i am a first time homebuyer and unfortunately we no longer live in the world where 20 down is mandatory which is part of the reason why housing prices are so high i feel it is more important that you are comfortable with what your monthly payments are as well as being informed on how interest rates can change how much you owe each month right now interest rates are pretty low and it would almost be silly to put 20 down on your home it might make more sense to put money in different vehicle right now if you have extra as the global economy will likely pick up and until it does interest rates will likely stay low just my 2 cents worth   edit i thought it would not be responsible of me not to mention that you should always have extra 's saved for closing costs they can be pricey and if you are not informed of what they are they can creep up on you

it seems to be that your main point is this no matter what my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit in general yes that is true but consider this very bad strategy buy one share of stock and sell it one minute later and repeat this every minute of the day obviously you would bleed your account dry with fees however even this horrible strategy still meets your criteria because if this bad strategy had an edge beyond the transaction fees you would likely still make a profit in other words your conclusion reduces to an uninteresting statement if there were no transactions fees then if your trading system has an edge then you will likely make a profit sorry to be the bearer of bad news but imho that statement and others made in the question are just obvious things stated in convoluted ways i do n't want to discourage you from thinking about these things though i personally really enjoy these type of thought experiments i just feel you missed the mark on this one

you might find some of the answers here helpful the question is different but has some similar concerns such as a changing economic environment what approach should i take to best protect my wealth against currency    devaluation poor growth prospects i want to avoid selling off any    more of my local index funds in a panic as i want to hold long term    does my portfolio balance make sense good question i ca n't even get us banks to answer questions like this such as what happens if they try to nationalize all bank accounts like in the soviet union   response it 'll never happen the question was what if i think that your portfolio carries a lot of risk but also offsets what you 're worried about   outside of government confiscation of foreign accounts if your foreign investments are held through a local brokerage you should be good   what to do about government confiscation   even the us government in 1933 confiscated physical gold and they made it illegal to own so even physical resources can be confiscated during hard times quite a large portion of my foreign investments have been bought at an    expensive time when our currency is already around historic lows    which does concern me in the event that it strengthens in future what    strategy should i take in the future if when my local currency starts    the strengthen do i hold my foreign investments through it and just    trust in cost averaging long term or try sell them off to avoid the    devaluation are these foreign investments a hedge   if so then you should n't worry if your currency does strengthen they serve the purpose of hedging the local environment   if these investments are not a hedge then timing will matter and you 'll want to sell and buy your currency before it does strengthen   the risk on this latter point is that your timing will be wrong

the roth traditional decision is complex but can be broken down into a set of simple rules   ideally you want to choose to tax your money at the lowest possible rate this specifically refers to your marginal rate the rate you last $ 100 was taxed or next $ 100 of income with be taxed that in itself is another issue answered with questions here discussing marginal rates   my suggestion has been that if you are in the 15 bracket use roth and continue to do so until you hit 25 at that point begin to shift to the traditional pre tax 401(k or ira my article the 15 solution goes into detail on this although it references the 2013 tax rates i need to re edit if you are already in the 25 bracket i 'd suggest just going pre tax given the ability to convert it 's not as if there are 2 points in time deposit and withdrawal but you can decide every year if your situation changes it 's not uncommon to get married have a baby buy a house and find you just dropped back down to 15 marginal rate when you were solidly 25 prior   let me explain why you should go 100 pretax if already at 25   a single person hits the top of the 15 bracket in 2017 at $ taxable add the standard deduction and exemption and you are at $ the tax on this is $ less than 10 average despite the next $ 100 being taxed at 25 it would take over $ 1 m to have an account large enough to withdraw $ 40k yr   if you blow through that number you hit 25 i agree but why pay 25 now for sure to avoid maybe hitting 25 later you have decades of opportunities for conversion and even more when the funds are transferred to iras if you have a job change and the conversion discussion has multiple layers when the ira is involved say you are too successful you are hitting $ 2 m before age 55 if you retire you can withdraw from the 401(k penalty free but you have 15 years before you 'd start to take ss benefits 15 years to use conversions even if pushing into 25 to reduce the impact of ss taxation   my advice is not a set and forget solution it 's an annual evaluation of the plan for the coming year   further notes on my choice of 15 solution this is the 2017 tax table for singles   i note that median individual income is k which puts that median single at ~20 k taxable this is where the analysis begins this earner might have upward mobility to reach the 25 bracket and begin to save pre tax the goal would be to have a mix of pre post tax money so that over the course of their life the 25 bracket was avoided perhaps completely   in general my writing tend towards the second highest quintile the 60 80 slice of the population the numbers might appear arbitrary but in the end the discussion has to start someplace the concept i described here is best implemented by the single or couple who is still at 15 but soon pushing higher than the line this enables them to start by saving in the roth and slowly shifting towards pre tax the final mix at retirement depends on that timing as well as their opportunities for conversions along the way   part of my focus on that line is that the differential is greatest in bracket shifts between 15 and 25 much of the benefit in the whole discussion is in that shift depositing at 25 yet withdrawing at 15 the 28 couple might wish to avoid the 33 bracket at retirement but that level of income impacts far fewer people and fewer still that are either reading these boards or my other writing

the must be language might be just from the old bank itself not from the irs   the language i see in publication 969 only says you can make contributions to your hsa for 2014 until april 15 2015 in this case it is understandable that the credit union you have the new account with does not want to accept the contribution for tax year 2014   you did n't have an account with them in 2014   you did n't even send out the paperwork to them to open the account until last week and they did n't open your account until this week after the deadline it is unfortunate but i do n't think you 'll be able to force them to do anything differently here   it is just too late i do know how that feels   i had a somewhat similar circumstance with my hsa the first year i had the account   i contributed money to the hsa using my credit union 's website transferring money from my checking account into my hsa as i was told to do   in january and february of the following year i made more contributions this way thinking that i was making them for the previous tax year   however they never got coded correctly by the credit union and i later found out that the credit union counted those as contributions for the current year   as a result i was essentially denied the full contribution limit for that year and had a bit of a paperwork nightmare   now if i have to make a prior year contribution i only make it in person and they have a form they have me fill out each time i do

really the question you need to ask yourself is how much risk you want to take in order to save a little on interest for 5 years rates are pretty close to a historic low and if you have good credit you should shop around a bit to get a good ideal of what a 15 or 30 year fixed loan would go for for people that are sure they will be selling a property in a few years a balloon or arm might not be a bad thing   otoh if their plans change or if you plan to stay in the property for longer e.g. 10 15 years then they have the potential to turn into a huge trap and could have the effect of forcing you to sell your house    the most likely people to fall into such a trap are those who are trying to buy more house than they can really afford and max out what they can pay using a lower rate and then later can not afford the payments if anything happens that makes the rate go up   over the last three years we 've seen a large number of foreclosures and short sales taking place are because of people who fell into just this kind of trap   i strongly advise you learn from their mistakes and do not follow in their   you need to consider what could happen in 5 years time    or if the economy takes off and/or the fed is not careful with interest rates and money supply we could see high inflation and high interest rates to go along with it    the odds of rates being any lower in 5 years time is probably pretty low   the odds of it being higher depends on who 's crystal ball you look at   i think most people would say that rates are likely to increase and the disagreement is over just how much and how soon   if you are forced to refinance in 5 years time and the rates are higher will you be able to make the payments or will you potentially be forced out of the house perhaps into something much smaller   what happens if the rates at that time are 9 and even an arm is only 6 could you make the payments or would you be forced to sell    potentially you could end up paying out more in interest than if you had just gotten a simple fixed loan myself i 'd not take the risk   for much of the last 40 years people would have sold off their children or body parts to get rates like we have today on a standard fixed loan   i 'd go for a standard fixed loan between 15 and 30 years duration   if you want to pay extra principle to get it paid off earlier in order to feel more secure or just get out from under the debt then do so personally i would n't bother not at today 's rates

there 's a concept in retail called a loss leader and essentially it means that a store will sell an item intentionally at a loss as a way of bringing in business in the hope that while consumers are in the store taking advantage of the discounted item they 'll make other purchases to make up for the loss and generate an overall profit many times it only makes sense to carry items that enhance the value of something else the store sells   stores pay big money to study consumer behaviors and preferences in order to understand what items are natural fits for each other and the best ways to market them    a good example of what you 're talking about is the fact that many grocery stores carry private label products that sell for higher margins and they 'll stock them alongside the name brands that cost much more   as a consequence and since consumers often do n't see a qualitative difference between store brands and name brands much of the time to rationalize spending more the store 's own brands sell better i hope this helps good luck

i would n't call them another snapchat they are n't dependent on advertising and they are actually in a pretty decent position what is concerning is that moving forward they think they advertising will make up for their losses and be enough to set them apart   other than that they have been cashing in the shift away from cable and the purchase only the networks you watch mentality they have the brand people like and trust they have the hardware and they are pretty boring at the end of the day i think they 'll be one of the few who survive if there were to be a major tech crash coming up

if your money market funds are short term savings or an emergency fund you might consider   moving them into an online saving account   you can get interest rates close to 1 often above 1 in higher rate climates and your savings are completely safe and easily accessible   online banks also frequently offer perks such as direct deposit linking with your checking account and discounts on other services you might need occasionally i.e. money orders or certified checks    if your money market funds are the lowest risk part of your diversified long term portfolio you should consider how low risk it needs to be   money market accounts are now typically fdic insured they did n't used to be but you can get the same security at a higher interest rate with laddered cd 's or u.s. savings bonds if your horizon is compatible if you want liquidity or greater return than a cd will give you then a bond fund or etf may be the right choice and it will tend to move counter to your stock investments balancing your portfolio    it 's true that interest rates will likely rise in the future which will tend to decrease the value of bond investments   if you buy and hold a single u.s. savings bond its interest payments and final payoff are set at purchase so you wo n't actually lose money but you might make less than you would if you invested in a higher rate climate   another way to deal with this if you want to add a bond fund to your long term investment portfolio is to invest your money slowly over time dollar cost averaging so that you do n't pay a high price for a large number of shares that immediately drop in value

the thing about the swiss banks is that the accounts there were anonymous that 's why it 's such a famous example until not so long ago the access to the account was by a password and no one knew whose account it is and to whom the money belongs that 's perfect for money laundering and various illegal activities like hiding bribe money stolen money evading taxes and what not the us pressured swiss to cancel that policy and now the swiss banks are basically the same as everywhere else there are other off shore places that still allow similar anonymous accounts i think having an account abroad is usually legal depends on the country of your citizenship of course i think in canada there 's no law against that certainly not in the us as long as you declare everything and the owners of the accounts are not anonymous and their id 's were verified by the bank by the way one of the former israeli prime ministers had to resign his post because journalists found out that his wife had a bank account in the us in that time late 1970 's it was illegal for israeli citizens to have accounts in foreign banks similar laws were in the ussr and most if not all of the eastern block all of these countries no longer forbid foreign bank accounts

it is perfectly legitimate to adjust your 1099-b income by broker 's fees   publication 17 p 116 specifically instructs taxpayers to adjust their schedule d reporting by broker 's fees form 1099-b transactions    if you sold property such as stocks bonds or certain commodities through a broker you should receive form 1099-b or substitute statement from the broker use the form 1099-b or the substitute statement to complete form 8949 if you sold a covered security in 2013 your broker should send you a form 1099-b or substitute statement that shows your basis this will help you complete form 8949 generally a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010 report the gross proceeds shown in box 2a of form 1099-b as the sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies however if the broker advises you in box 2a of form 1099-b that gross proceeds sales price less commissions and option premiums were reported to the irs enter that net sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies include in column g any expense of sale such as broker 's fees commissions state and local transfer taxes and option premiums unless you reported the net sales price in column d if you include an expense of sale in column g enter e in column f you can rely on your own records and judgment if you feel comfortable doing so   brokers often make incomplete tax reporting   this may have been simpler from their perspective if the broker fees were variable or integrated or unknown for a number of clients party to a transaction   if a taxpayer has documentation of the expenses that justify an adjustment then it 's perfectly appropriate to include that in the calculations it is not necessary to report the discrepancy and it may increase scrutiny to include a written addendum   the schedule d form 8949 and form 1099-b will probably together adequately explain the source of the deduction

summary it 's because you are effectively contributing more money in the second case so you have more money at the end   the effect of being covered by an employer retirement plan in the case of a 401(k that means either you or your employer contributed to it during the year is that it prevents you from deducting traditional ira contributions unless your income is below a very low level for single filing status it phases out at an magi of between $ and $ since you are unable to deduct the traditional ira contribution but you entered that you are still making the full $ 5500 contribution every year that means you are making a non deductible contribution of $ 5500 every year instead of a deductible contribution nondeductible contributions are after tax whereas deductible contributions are pre tax because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of the contribution so you effectively do n't pay income tax on the income you used to contribute $ 1 of pre tax money is not the same as $ 1 of after tax money if your marginal tax rate is 25 then $ 1 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 0.75 of after tax money however since in both cases you are putting in the same nominal amount of contribution $ 5500 but one is pre tax and one is after tax in the after tax case you are effectively contributing more money i.e. more money is taken out from your bank account that year the $ 5500 pre tax contribution is equivalent to only $ 5500 0.75 = $ after tax i.e. you are only short $ from your bank account at the end of the year after making a $ 5500 deductible contribution whereas you are short $ 5500 after making a $ 5500 non deductible contribution so it 's not a fair comparison the non deductible traditional ira contributions are not taxed when withdrawn though the earnings earned from those contributions are still taxed so that 's why you are left with a greater amount this is a similar situation to what happens when you try to compare a $ 5500 deductible traditional ira contribution to a $ 5500 roth ira contribution it will look like the roth ira case leaves you with much more money but that 's again because you are effectively contributing more money because the roth ira contribution is after tax so it 's not a fair comparison the roth ira case will produce a much greater advantage than the non deductible traditional ira contribution case because for a roth ira both the contributions and earnings will not be taxed at withdrawal

when your dream car is not just 200 times your disposable income but in fact 200 times your whole monthly salary then there is no way for you to afford it right now any attempt to finance through a loan would put you into a debt trap you wo n't ever dig yourself out   and if there are any car dealerships in your country which claim otherwise run away fast jon oliver from last week tonight made a video about business practices of car dealerships in the united states which sell cars on loans to people who ca n't afford them a while ago as usual when a deal seems too good to be true it generally is n't true at all after a few months the victims customers usually end up with no car but lots of outstanding debt they pay off for years so how do you tell if you can afford a car or not a new car usually lives for about 10 20 years so when you want to calculate the monthly cost of owning a new car divide the price by 120 but that 's just the price for buying the vehicle not for actually driving it cars cost additional money each month for gas repairs insurance taxes etc these costs depend a lot on your usage pattern and location so i can not provide you with any numbers for that if you have less disposable income per month as in money you currently have left at the end of each month than monthly cost of purchase plus expected monthly running costs you can not afford the car possible alternatives

for the first part of your question refer to related question   why do some online stores not ask for the code on the back of my credit card the other case of airport ticket machines requires the physical presence of card the assumption is that if you had the card before and after the transaction it was you who used it for transaction as the amounts are small its really easy by anyone merchant banks to write this off the only way to misuse would be if you lost the card and someone used it also these ticket machines would have built in feature where by you can not buy more than x tickets for the day ensuring max loss on a stolen card is limited to a small amount

typically investing in only two securities is not a good idea when trying to spread risk even though you are in the vti which is spread out over a large amount of it should in theory reduce portfolio beta to zero or in this case as close to it as possible the vti however has a beta of 1.03 as of close today in new york this means that the vti moves roughly in exact tandem as the market usually against the s&p 500 so this means that the vti is slightly more volatile than that index in theory beta can be 0 this would be akin to investing in t bills which are assumed to be the risk free rate so in theory it is possible to reduce the risk in your portfolio and apply a more capital protective model i hope this helps you a bit

the first thing i assess when looking at new credit cards is whether it has no annual fee the second thing i look at is how long the interest free period is i always pay my credit card off in full just before the due date any rewards program is a bonus my main credit card is with cba i have a credit limit of $ 20 k and pay no annual fee i get a bonus point for every $ i spend on it for which i exchange for store gift cards to help with my everyday spending approximately 3500 point would get me a $ 25 gift card but my main reward with the card is the interest i save by keeping my own money in a home loan offset account whilst i spend with the bank 's money then i pay the full amount off by the due date so i do not pay any interest on the credit card i only use my credit cards for purchases i would usually make anyway and to pay bills so my spending would be the same with or without a credit card i can usually save over $ 500 each year off my home loan interest and get about $ 350 worth of gift cards each year if i did n't have any home loans then i would keep my money in a high interest account so i would be increasing my interest payments each year sure you can probably get credit cards with more generous rewards programs but how much are you paying each year in annual fees and if you do n't have an interest free period and you do n't pay off all the amount due each month how much are you paying in interest on the card this is what you need to way up when looking at rewards programs on offer nothing is for free well almost nothing

i 'm not sure there 's a good reason to do a closing the books ceremony for personal finance accounting and you 're not only wanting to do that but have a fiscal year that 's different from the calendar year yikes my understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their retained earnings and such are for investors and tax purposes generally individuals would n't think of their finances in those terms it 's certainly not impossible though gnucash for example implements a closing books feature which is designed to create transactions for each income and expenses account into an end of year equity retained earnings account it does n't do any sort of closing out of assets or liabilities however and i 'm not sure how that would make any sense as you 'd transfer it from your asset to the end of year closing account and then transfer it back as an opening balance for the next year if you want to keep each year completely separate the page about closing books in the gnucash wiki mentions that one can create a separate gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file then importing that tree and the balances into a new file i expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data though while your question does n't seem to be specific to gnucash i just mention it because it 's the accounting tool i 'm most familiar with i 'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality i would however like to point out this section from the gnucash manual note that closing the books in gnucash is unnecessary you do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period gnucash ’s built in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods in fact closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports do n’t currently understand closing transactions so from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero and that 's largely why i 'm just not sure what your goals are if you want to look at your transactions for a certain time to just focus on the range of years i 'm interested in for any given purpose as you say then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates the idea of closing books comes from a time when you 'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you did n't need to refer to them regularly computers now have no challenges storing every account from the beginning of time at all and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you 're looking for easily if you do n't want to look at the old data just do n't include them in your reports i 'm pretty sure that 's the better way to keep the books manageable

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt
