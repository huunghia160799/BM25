gnucash wo n't show credit card type accounts in process payment as of a workaround is to create another   account of type a payable then transfer the operations you want to pay via process payment to this new account it should be visible now a drawback is that you have split your current credit card debt which makes it harder to track alternatively you may wish to only use this new account for all your credit card related expenses another alternative is processing payments for these purchases manually to keep the credit card accounts consistent

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

this is what this sounds like to me also selling a personal item at a loss is generally not a taxable event you can not report it as a loss and the irs ca n't tax a transaction like that if you really want to include these as sales as part of your llc you 'll probably have to pay tax if you list it as income i 'm just confused as to why you 'd want to do that if you know that you 're selling these particular items at a loss and you also know that you have no documentation for them i just would n't report anything you sold at a loss and treat it as garage sale items separate from your business

on what basis did you do your initial allocation of funds to each stock    if you are re balancing that implies returning things to their initial allocation   you can do this without any research or recommendations if you started out with say 10 stocks and 10 of the funds allocated to each stock then re balancing would simply be either buying selling to return to that initial allocation   if you are contributing to the portfolio you could adjust where the new money goes to re balance without selling   or if you are drawing money from the portfolio then you could adjust what you are selling if on the other hand you are trying to decide if you want to alter the stocks the portfolio is holding then you have an entirely different question from re balancing

on expiry with the underlying share price at $ 46 we have you ask   how come they 600 100 why because you have sold the $ 45 call to open you position you must now buy it back to close your position   this will cost you $ 100 so you are debited for $ 100 and this debit is being represented as a negative subtracted i.e. because you have purchased the $ 40 call to open your position you must now sell it to close your position   upon selling this option you will receive $ 600 so you are credited with $ 600 and this credit is represented as a positive added i.e. + $ 600 therefore upon settlement closing your position will get you $ = $ 500   this is the first point you are questioning    however you should also note that this is the value of the spread at settlement and it does not include the costs of opening the spread position which are given as $ 200 so you net profit is $ = $ 300 you then comment   i know i am selling 45 call that means as a writer i want stock price to go down or stay at strike as a buyer i want stock price to go up here note that for every penny that the underlying share price rises above $ 45 the money you will pay to buy back your short $ 45 call option will be offset by the money you will receive by selling the long $ 40 call option   your $ 40 call option is covering the losses on your short $ 45 call option no matter how high the underlying price settles above $ 45 you will receive the same $ 500 net credit on settlement   for example if the underlying price settles at $ 50 then you will receive a credit of $ 1000 for selling your $ 40 call but you will incur a debit of $ 500 against for buying back your short $ 45 call   the net being $ 500 = $   this point is made in response to your comments posted under dr. jones answer

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

there seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story   gt some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on   gap   gt everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   we went from a system where the underlying product apples could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently can not be obtained leaving only derivative if that markets of people swapping notes for other products and services   do you mean to say the enterprising person simply ended the ability to get apples and switched cold turkey to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable

on the one hand the author says this   gt;the seizing of land from individuals by government without just compensation deserves to be called tyranny   then in the next breath says this   owners merely need to pay the communities from which they receive benefits through their exclusive use of land the exact market value of the benefits that they receive   there is no way to pay the communities except through some form of representation government   so what the author is stating is that people who gain value of the land they use must pay the government a fair market value for that use   also known as taxation   but the author takes it one step further all land should be in the hands of the representatives of the community government and everyone must lease said land from the community government     yeah that will work well

the key to becoming wealthy as a self employed person is the drive to be successful a driven person who starts their own company or companies should they fail will find success assuming that you define success as the accumulation of wealth then yes self employment is correlated with wealth but as matt mentions in the comments there is no casual in the statistical sense relationship between self employment and wealth while i ca n't say for sure i would argue that drive is more important that the employment situation

this page from the cra website details the types of investments you can hold in a tfsa you can hold individual shares including etfs traded on any designated stock exchange in addition to the other types of investment you have listed   here is a list of designated stock exchanges provided by the department of finance   as you can see it includes pretty well every major stock exchange in the developed world if your bank 's tfsa only offers mutual funds gics and saving deposits then you need to open a tfsa with a different bank or a stock company with an execution only service that offers tfsa accounts   almost all of the big banks will do this   i use hsbc invest direct and td though my tfsa 's are all with hsbc currently   you will simply provide them with details of your bank account in order to facilitate money transfers tfsa contributions since purchasing foreign shares involves changing your canadian dollars into a foreign currency one thing to watch out for when purchasing foreign shares is the potential for high foreign exchange spreads   they can be excessive in proportion to the investment being made   my experience is that hsbc offers by far the best spreads on fx but you need to exchange a minimum of $ 10,000 in order to obtain a decent spread typically between 0.25 and 0.5   you may also wish to note that you can buy unhedged etfs for the us and european markets on the toronto exchange   this means you are paying next to nothing on the spread though you obviously are still carrying the currency risk   for example an unhedged s&p500 trades under the code bmo unhedged or ishares unhedged in addition it is important to consider that commissions for trades on foreign markets may be much higher than those on a canadian exchange   this is not always the case   hsbc charge me a flat rate of $ for both toronto and new york trades but for london they would charge up to 0.5 depending on the size of the trade   some foreign exchanges carry additional trading costs   for example london has a 0.5 stamp duty on purchases edit one final thing worth mentioning is that in my experience   holding us securities means that you will be required to register with the us tax authorities and with those us exchanges upon which you are trading   this just means fill out a number of different forms which will be provided by your stock broker exchange registrations can be done electronically however us tax authority registration must be submitted in writing   dividends you receive will be net of us withholding taxes   i am not aware of any capital gains reporting requirements to us authorities

in the us mortgage payments are not deductible what is deductible is the mortgage interest to a limit that as well is not deductible but rather as part of your itemized deductions on schedule a of your yearly tax return so if you 're married and have a standard deduction of $ a year live in a state with no state income tax and your property tax and the mortgage interest are less than your standard deduction you will not be getting any tax benefit whatsoever that is in fact the case for many if not majority of the us mortgage payers so in order to get a proper estimate you need to take into account all the aspects of your tax calculations which are by nature quite personal and simulate the changes with the mortgage interest deduction most tax preparation software will allow you creating multiple files so you can run the numbers for different scenarios

all of the provided advice is great but a slightly different viewpoint on debt is worth mentioning here are the areas that you should concentrate your efforts and the rough order you should proceed much of the following is predicated upon your having a situation where you need to get out of debt and learn to better budget and control your spending you may already have accomplished some of these steps or you may prioritize differently many people advise prioritizing contributing to a 401(k savings plan but with the assumption that you need advise because you have debt trouble you are probably paying absurd interest rates and any savings you might have will be earning much lower rates than you are paying on consumer debt if you are already contributing continue the plan but remember you are looking for advice because your financial situation is in trouble so you need to put out the fire your present problem and learn how to manage your money and plan for the future compose a budget comprised of the following three areas the exact percentages are fungible fit them to your circumstances here is where planning can get fun when you have freed yourself from debt and you can make choices that with your individual goals once you have put out the fire of debt then you should do two things at the same time as you pay off debt and avoid further debt you will find that saving for both independence and retirement become easier   the average american household may have $ 8000 + credit card debt and at 20 30 the interest payments are $ 150 200/month and the average car payment is nearly $ 500/month   eliminate debt and you will have $ 500 800/month that you can comfortably allocate towards retirement but you also need to learn educate yourself how to invest your money to grow your money and earn income from your savings this is an area where many struggle because we are taught to save but we are not taught how to invest choose investments wisely and carefully and how to decide our goals   investing needs to be addressed separately but you need to learn how live in an affordable house and pay off your mortgage   consider that the payment on a mortgage on even a modest $ 200 k house is over $ 1000/month combine saving the money you would have paid towards a mortgage payment with the money you would have paid towards credit card debt or a car loan saving becomes easy when you are freed from these large debts

is your name on the title at all you may have slightly more leverage in that case but co signing any loans is not a good idea even for a friend or relative as this article notes generally co signing refers to financing not ownership if the    primary fails to make payments on the loan or the retail    installment sales contract a type of auto financing dealers sell    the co signer is responsible for those payments or their credit will    suffer even if the co signer makes the payments they ’re still not    the owner if their name is n’t on the title the consumer finance protection bureau cfpb notes if you co sign a loan you are legally obligated to repay the loan in    full co signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference    for someone else   when you co sign you promise to pay the loan yourself it means that    you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately if the    borrower defaults on the loan the creditor can use the same    collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower    such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself suing you    and your wages or bank accounts after a judgment your    credit may be impacted by any late payments or defaults co signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the    vehicle it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to    repay the amount of the loan so make sure you can afford to pay this    debt if the borrower can not per this article and this article options to remove your name from co signing include if you 're name is n't on the title you 'll have to convince your ex boyfriend and the bank to have you removed as the co signer but from your brief description above it does n't seem that your ex is going to be cooperative unfortunately as the co signer and guarantor of the loan you 're legally responsible for making the payments if he does n't not making the payments could ruin your credit as well one final option to consider is bankruptcy bankruptcy is a drastic option and you 'll have to weigh whether the disruption to your credit and financial life will be worth it versus repaying the balance of that auto loan per this post another not so pretty option is bankruptcy this is an extreme route    and in some instances may not even guarantee a name removal from the    loan your best bet is to contact a lawyer or other source of legal help to review your options on how to proceed with this issue

carmax will be interested in setting a price that allows them to make money on the reselling of the vehicle they wo n't offer you more than that the determination of the value compared to the value is based on condition and miles the refinancing of the auto loan could lower your monthly payment but may not save you any money in the short term the new lender will also want an evaluation of the vehicle and if it is less than the payoff amount of the current loan they will ask you to make a lump sum payment this is addition to the cost of getting the new loan setup if you can pay the delta between the value of the car and loan then do so when you sell the car do n't refinance unless you plan on keeping the car for many months or you are just adding paperwork to the transaction

you can try paper trading to your investing stocks to invest how much money to allocate and stuff but nothing compares to getting beaten black and blue in the real world when virtual money is involved you may n't care because you do n't loose anything but when your hard earned money disappears or grows no paper trading can those feelings in you so there is no guarantee that doing paper trading will make you a better investor but can help you a lot in terms of learning secondly educate yourself on the ways of investing it is hard work and realize that there is no substitute for hard work india is a growing economy and your friends maybe safe in the short term but take it from any investor not in the long run and moreover as all economies are recovering from the recession there are ample opportunities to invest money in india both good and bad calculate your returns and compare it with your friends maybe a year or two down the lane to compare the returns generated from both sides maybe they would come trumps but remember selecting a good investment from a bad investment will surely pay out in the long run   not sure what you do not understand what buffet says it can not get more simpler than that if you can drill those rules into your blood you may n't become a billionaire but surely you will make a killing but in the long run read and read as much as you can buy books browse the net this might help one more guy like you

on most proxy statements all i have ever received you have the ability to abstain from voting   just go down the list and check abstain then return the form   you will effectively be forfeiting your right to vote edit according to this after january 1 2010 and trashing the voting materials are the same thing   prior to january 1 2010 your broker could vote however they wanted on your behalf if you chose not to vote yourself   the one caveat is this seems to only apply to the nyse unless i am reading it wrong   so not sure about stocks listed on the nasdaq

there is very little effect whatsoever of having a joint bank account positive or negative positive effects it would be very easy to send your mother money she can just take it out of the account   if you passed away she could get the money without having to use the legal system or vice versa this latter effect is why i have a bunch of joint accounts with my wife if either of us died i would n't want getting access to our money to be an additional hassle negative effects she is able to access money in that account without your which you have pointed out is not going to happen   the case i 'm thinking of would be something like a tax lien against her   a government agency might choose to pull money out of that joint account   that would be a downside for you if we were discussing credit cards a loan or a line of credit there would be a number of legal and credit rating effects from joint ownership   not so much with checking accounts

the bid price is simply the highest buy price currently being offered and the ask price simply the lowest sell price being offered the list of bid and ask prices is called the market depth when the bid and ask prices match then a sale goes through when looking to sell you would generally look at both the bid and ask prices as a seller you want to be matched with the bid price to get a sale but you also need to check the current list of ask prices if the price you want to sell at is too high you will be placed down the ask price list and unless the price moves up to match your sell price you will not end up selling on the other hand if your price to sell is too low and in fact much lower than the current lowest sell price you may get a quick sale but maybe at a lower price than you could have gotten similarly when looking to buy you would generally also look at both the bid and ask prices as a buyer you want to be matched with the ask price to get a sale but you also need to check the current list of bid prices if the price you want to buy at is too low you will be placed down the bid price list and unless the price moves down to match your buy price you will no end up buying on the other hand if your price to buy is too high and in fact much higher than the current highest buy price you may get a quick purchase but maybe at a higher price than you could have gotten so whether buying or selling it is important to look at and consider both the bid and ask prices in the market depth

the is a record of the total benefits you 've received in a tax year that have n't been taxed in another way a bit like the is a record of the total pay and tax you 've paid in a tax year note that travel for business purposes should n't be taxable and if that 's what 's being reported on the you may need to make a claim for tax relief to hmrc to avoid having to pay the tax i 'm not sure whether it 's normal for such expenses to be reported there hmrc will normally collect that tax by adjusting your tax code after the is issued so that more tax is taken off your future income so you do n't need to do anything as it 'll be handled automatically as to how you know it 's accurate if you have any doubts you 'd need to contact your former employer and ask them to confirm the details in general you ought to know what benefits you actually received so should at least be able to figure out if the number is plausible if your travel was a flight to the usa then probably it was if it was a bus ticket less so if you fill in a tax return you 'll also have to report the amount there which will increase the tax you owe reduce your refund you wo n't be charged twice even if your tax code also changes as the tax return accounts for the total amount of tax you 've already paid for travel benefits the exact treatment in relation to tax is here

first it 's clear from your story that you very likely should be able to receive some financial aid   that may be in the form of loans or better grants in which you just get free money to attend college   for example a pell grant   you wo n't get all you 'd need for a free ride this way but you can really make a dent in what you 'd pay   the college may likely also provide financial aid to you   in order to get any of this though you have to fill out a fafsa   there are deadlines for this for each state and each college there you would ask individually   i 'd get looking into that as soon as you can do student loans have to be paid monthly   any loan is a specific agreement between a lender and a borrower so any payment terms could apply such as or quarterly   but monthly seems like the most reasonable assumption   generally you should assume the least favorable reasonably likely terms for you so that you are prepared for a worst case scenario   let 's say monthly can i just as i had hoped borrow large sums of money and only start    paying them after college yes   that is a fair summary of all a student loan is   importantly though some loans are federal government subsidized loans for which the interest on the loan is paid for you as long as you stay in college + 6 months although do check that is the current situation   unsubsidized loans may accrue interest from the start of the loan period   if you have the option obviously try hard to get the subsidized loans as the interest can be significant   i made a point to only take subsidized loans    warning student loans currently enjoy a nearly unique status in america as being one of the only loan types that are not in bankruptcy   this means that if you leave college with $ 100,000 in debt that begins accruing interest there is no way for you to get out of it short of fleeing the country or existence   and at that point the creditors may come after your mother for the balance   these loans can balloon into outrageous amounts due to compounding interest   please have a healthy fear of student loans   for more on this listen to this hour long radio program about this would a minimum wage job help   of course it will help but will it help enough   that depends on how much you work   if you make $ and work 20 hrs week for all but 3 weeks of the year after taxes you will be adding about $ 6,000 to offset your costs   in 3 years of college see below that 's $ 18,000 which depending on where you go is not bad at helping costs   if you are at full time 40 hrs then it is $ 12k yr or $ 36k toward costs   these numbers are nothing to sniff at do you have any computer web graphics skills   it 's possible you could find ways to make more than minimum wage if you learn some niche it industry skill   if i could go back and re do those years i would n't have wasted much time delivering pizzas and would have learned html in the 90s and would have potentially made some significant money would college and full time job be manageable together   that 's highly specific to each situation which job   how far a commute to it   which major how efficient are you   how easily do you learn but i would say that for the most part it 's not a good idea not only for the academic achievement side of it but the personal enrichment aspect of college   clubs sports relationships activities dorm bull sessions all that good stuff they deserve their space and time and it 'd be a shame to miss out on that because you 're on the 2nd shift at wal mart 40hrs week how do i find out what scholarships grants and financial aid i can apply for   are you in a high school with a career or guidance counselor   if so go to that person about this as a start   if not there are tons of resources out there   public libraries should have huge directories of scholarships   the federal student loan program has a website   there are also a lot of resources online found by just searching google for scholarships though do be careful about any online sources including this advice lastly please carefully consider the overall cost vs. benefit to you   college in 2012 is anything but cheap   a typical price for a textbook is $ 150 or more   tuition and board can range over $ 40k at private colleges   there is a recent growing call for americans to re think the automatic nature of going to college considering the enormous financial burden it puts many families under   charles murray for one has put out a book suggesting that far too many students go to college now to society 's and many individuals detriment he 's a controversial thinker but i think some of his points are valid and actually urgent   with all that said consider ways to go to college but keep costs down   public colleges in your state will almost always be significantly cheaper than private or out of state   once there aim for as and bs don't cheat yourself out of what you pay for   and lastly consider a plan in which you complete college in three years by attending summer courses   this website has a number of other options for helping to reduce the cost of college

this question can simply be answered with it depends but i am sure that is not the answer you want so here is all of the reasons why it depends the philosophy behind real time energy pricing is that   you pay for what it actually costs for the energy to be produced peak times costs the power company a lot of money to produce the power there are many reasons for this but the simplest reason is that at some point the company will have to build extra power plants in order to be able to provide for the peak demand while these plants will be widely during off peak times in the traditional flat rate charge per billing you had to be charged higher then it actually costs during the off peak hours in order for the power company to make sure they brought in enough money to cover the costs of the peak hours technology has now advanced enough that power company can charge you more directly of what it actually costs them potentially this could mean that you would pay more in electricity this can happen if you are a person who loves to use energy during peak hours do you like turning on all of your lights when you get home from work in the summer what about watching tv or what about cooking dinner or what about turning the ac down colder to overcome the heat produced by cooking dinner all of those things that you might be used to doing are actually costing the power company more money because they have to plan for those higher peak loads you can save yourself money if you are willing to shift your usage to other times of day such as cook later in the evening or decide to grill outside or wait to watch your tv show until later in the evening if you are someone who is stuck in your ways and does n't want to adjust the time of day that you do certain things doing real time pricing may end up costing you more some people could argue that it actually should cost you more why should someone who is saving the power company money have to pay extra for someone who is costing the power company more money all of this is viewed from the short term though you may save some money here or there or you may end up paying a little extra here or there but i truly believe that in the long run everything will equalize out such that you will be paying the same anyways or at least a small enough difference i would n't worry about it if you stick with the flat rate pricing they are already have to factor in you being a peak rate user when you might not actually be one   in short if you are willing to adjust your habits i will almost promise you that you will save money if you do n't want to change and especially like to use energy during summer you might want to just stay where you are at

remember that balance transfers are rarely fee free as you state there is a fee associated with the balance transfer if your 0 rate is for 18 months and the fee is 3 you are really paying 2 per year on the amount you transferred the advantage is that you can redirect the debt you transferred is interest free and you can attack other debt with high interest on it this can save you in interest fees and allow you to direct more of your money towards debt the disadvantage is that your 0 interest will expire and become a much higher interest rate unless you pay off the transfer before the expiration you will have to pay off the debt at the higher interest how you decide to attack your debt reduction may need to factor in how long you expect to have debt and what other debt you have often times though the savings in interest is less important than simplifying the number of debt accounts you have the inspiration you receive from reducing your debt accounts is much more powerful you realize reducing debt accounts allows you to actually see an end in sight and provides the recurring positive feedback that you are making progressing this is why the advice to pay off your lowest balance credit cards first

i think to some extent you may be confusing the terms margin and leverage from investopedia two concepts that are important to traders are margin and leverage margin is a loan extended by your broker that allows you to leverage the funds and securities in your account to enter larger trades in order to use margin you must open and be approved for a margin account the loan is collateralized by the securities and cash in your margin account the borrowed money does n't come free however it has to be paid back with interest if you are a day trader or this may not be a concern but if you are a swing trader you can expect to pay between 5 and 10 interest on the borrowed money or margin going hand in hand with margin is leverage you use margin to create leverage leverage is the increased buying power that is available to margin account holders   essentially leverage allows you to pay less than full price for a trade giving you the ability to enter larger positions than would be possible with your account funds alone leverage is expressed as a ratio a 2:1 leverage for example means that you would be able to hold a position that is twice the value of your trading account if you had $ 25,000 in your trading account with 2:1 leverage you would be able to purchase $ 50,000 worth of stock margin refers to essentially buying with borrowed money   this must be paid back with interest   you also may have a margin call forcing you to liquidate assets if you go beyond your margin limits leverage can be achieved in a number of ways when investing one of which is investing with a margin account

the fact you are asking this question the number of up votes the real cause of the banking crisis     answers which mention that shareholders will fire a public company board are on the bottom it is obvious that a company owners are interested in company value and should have direct and easy impact on a directors board if management does n't increase shareholders wealth   with large number of passive shareholders and current stock market system that impact is very limited hence your question   so bank directors upper management are n't that interested in company value they are mostly interested in theirs bonuses their wealth increase not shareholders and that 's the real problem of capitalism public companies slowly drift to function like companies in former socialistic countries these is no owner everything is owned by a nation

the obvious advantage is turning your biggest liability into an income generating asset the downside are 1 you have to find tenants postings time to show the place credit background check and etc 2 you have to deal with tenants collection of rent repairs of things that broke by itself complaints from neighbors termination and etc 3 you have to deal with the repairs in many ways it 's no different from running another small business so it all boils down to how much time you are willing to invest and how handy you are in doing reno 's and/or small repairs around the house for profitability roi analysis you want to assume collection of 11 months of rent per year i.e. assume tenant does n't renew after year so you have the worst case scenario and factor in all the associated expense be honest   renting out a second property is a bit tricky as you often have to deal with a large operating expense i.e. mortgage and renting a basement apartment is not bad financially and you will have to get used to have strangers downstairs

i 'm fairly convinced there is no difference whatsoever between dividend payment and capital appreciation   it only makes financial sense for the stock price to be decreased by the dividend payment so over the course of any specified time interval without the dividend the stock price would have been that much higher were the dividends not paid   total return is equal i think this is like so many things in finance that seem different but actually are n't if a stock does not pay a dividend you can synthetically create a dividend by periodically selling shares    doing this would incur periodic trade commissions however   that does seem like a loss to the investor   for this reason i do see some real benefit to a dividend   i 'd rather get a check in the mail than i would have to pay a trade commission which would offset a percentage of the dividend does anybody know if there are other hidden fees associated with dividend payments that might offset the trade commissions   one thought i had was fees to the company to establish and maintain a dividend payment program   are there significant administrative fees banking fees etc to the company that materially decrease its value   even if this were the case i do n't know how i 'd detect or measure it because there 's such a loose association between many corporate financials e.g. cash on hand and stock price

i have about $ 1 k in savings and have been told that you should get into investment and saving for retirement early i make around $ 200 per week which about $ 150 goes into savings that 's $ 10k per year   the general rule of thumb is that you should have six months income as an emergency fund   so your savings should be around $ 5k   build that first    some argue that the standard should be six months of living expenses rather than income   personally i think that this example is exactly why it is income rather than living expenses   six months of living expenses in this case would only be $ 1250 which wo n't pay for much   and note that living expenses can only be calculated after the fact   if your estimate of $ 50 a week is overly optimistic you might not notice for months until some large living expense pops up    another problem with using living expenses as the measure is that if you hold down your living expenses to maximize your savings this helps both measures   then you hit your savings target and your living expenses increase   so you need more savings   by contrast if your income increases but your living expenses do not you still need more savings but you can also save more money   does n't really change the basic analysis though   either way you have an emergency savings target that you should hit before starting your retirement savings    if you save $ 150 per week then you should have around $ 4k in savings at the beginning of next year   that 's still low for an emergency fund by the income standard   so you probably should n't invest next year   with a living expenses standard you could have $ in savings by april 15th deadline for an ira contribution that appears in the previous tax year   that 's $ 5000 more than the $ 1250 emergency fund so you could afford an ira probably a roth that year    if you save $ 7500 next year and start with $ 4k in savings under the income standard for emergency savings that would leave you with $ 11,500   take $ 5500 of that and invest in an ira probably a roth   after that you could make a $ 100 deposit per week for the next year   or just wait until the end    if you invested in an ira the previous year because you decided use the living expenses standard you would only have $ 6500 at the end of the year   if you wait until you have $ you could max out your ira contribution   at that point your excess income for each year would be larger than the maximum ira contribution so you could max it out until your circumstances change    if you do n't actually save $ 3k this year and $ 7500 next year do n't sweat it   a college education is enough of an investment at your age   do that first then emergency savings then retirement    that will flip around once you get a better paying long term job   then you should include retirement savings as an expected cost   so you 'd pay the minimum required for your education loans and other required living expenses then dedicate an amount for retirement savings then build your emergency savings then pay off your education loans above the minimum payment   this is where it can pay to use the more aggressive living expenses standard as that allows you to pay off your education loans faster    i would invest retirement savings in a nice diversified index fund or two since maintaining the correct stock bond mix of stocks is less risky than investing in just bonds much less just stocks   investing in individual stocks is something you should do with excess money that you can afford to lose   secure your retirement first   then stock investments are gravy if they pan out   if they do n't you 're still all right   but if they do you can make bigger decisions e.g. buying a house    realize that buying individual stocks is about more than just buying an app   you have to both check the fundamentals which the app can help you do and find other reasons to buy a stock   if you rely on an app then you 're essentially joining everyone else using that app   you 'll make the same profit as everyone else which wo n't be much because you all share the profit opportunities with the app 's system   if you want to use someone else 's system stick with mutual funds   the app system is actually more dangerous in the long term    early in the app 's life cycle its system can produce positive returns because a small number of people are sharing the benefits of that system   as more people adopt it though the total possible returns stay the same   at some point users the app   all the possible returns are realized   then users are competing with each other for returns   the per user returns will shrink as usage grows    if you have your own system then you are competing with fewer people for the returns from it   share the fundamental analysis but pick your stocks based on other criteria   fundamental analysis will tell you if a stock is overvalued   the other criteria will tell you which undervalued stock to buy

as some others have pointed out it 's key to remember the difference in market value and accounting value   to simplify things book value is the only item that specifically depreciates it happens in the world of accounting to try to time when did i use a long term asset with when did i obtain value from that asset for a house governments usually allow owners to claim depreciation of the building over a set period of time this does not affect your resale value of the house   similarly for a commercial property governments set laws for how an individual or a company can time the use of that asset vs. their accounting some companies can have totally depreciated zero cost assets that are still very productive    market property values are derived from 3 specific sources value in trade is an estimate of the value that others would be willing to pay for a similar asset that 's why you can buy a house today and in a normal market the same house should be worth a similar amount of money in the future value in use can be more interesting this is where a farmer can extract $ 100,000 in value per year from 10 acres of land but as a region develops a manufacturing company can generate $ 300,000 per year from the same 10 acres of land the company can buy out the farmer at a fair price > $ 100,000 per year and still net positive from the investment   income approach tends to be focused on properties that have a cash flow but can be adapted to other property estimates it evaluates the current business case for any property with the cost of money down the overall investment price and the expected value from any returns   remember the market value is very simply the price you could obtain if you sold the asset at a given time it is rarely considered in terms of how much will this go down   book value is an accounting exercise and declines by a set amount every year because it means you can estimate the cost of owning an asset vs the value it generates in a particular time period

your plan is n't bad but it probably is n't worth the cost for the small amount of credit building it will achieve if you do decide to continue with it though you 'll save in interest if you make the big payment now rather than in 6 months in other words you can take the minimum payment multiply it by 5 subtract that amount from the total you owe and pay the difference immediately this way you 'll still get the 6 months of reporting to the credit bureaus but you 'll pay less interest since you 'll have less principle each month i would recommend applying for the credit card right now i believe you 'll probably get approved now if you do then pay off the car loan without thinking about it if you do n't get approved think about it then probably still pay it off regarding the full coverage insurance even after the loan is paid off and you are n't required to have it you may still want to keep it even if you 're the best driver on earth if someone hits you and does n't have insurance or they have insurance and drive off or a deer runs in front of you etc you 'll lose your car and wo n't be reimbursed also as russell pointed out in the comments below without collision coverage your insurance company has no incentive to work on your behalf when someone else hits you so even if it 's not your fault you may still not get reimbursed so i would n't pass on the full coverage unless your car is n't worth very much or you can stomach losing it if something happens good luck and congrats on being able to pay for a car in full at 19 years old

financial advisers like to ask lots of questions and get nitty gritty about investment objectives but for the most part this is not well founded in financial theory   investment objectives really boils down to one big question and an addendum   the big question is how much risk you are willing to tolerate   this determines your expected return and most characteristics of your portfolio the addendum is what assets you already have background risk   your portfolio should contain things that hedge that risk and not load up on it   if you expect to have a fixed income some extra inflation protection is warranted   if you have a lot of real estate investing your portfolio should avoid real estate   if you work for google you should avoid it in your portfolio or perhaps even short it given risk tolerance and background risk financial theory suggests that there is a single best portfolio for you which is diversified across all available assets in a market cap weighted fashion

comission is a must when doing sales that is the best and only good incentive to sell more how much you want to give all depends on margins the salary level that is accepted in your state country and what sellers you have young or old   salary costs at 30 35 of total order value is normal including salary tax and all tax oriented costs around that employee    there are 2 ways of doing it only high commission and fixed salary + lower commission even if you use fixed salary + commission you can have restrictions so they have to sell above a certain level to get that commission that means that you do n't take any risks    an example of a salary model that i found was popular the numbers are just made up according to what is normal to have in sweden it 's a step model if you sell for   step 1 0 $ 3000 you get high commission 20 of everything you sell   step 2 $ 3000 $ 4000 you get fixed salary of $ 1000 + 10 commission   step 3 $ 4000 $ 6000 you get fixed salary of $ 1700 + 15 commission   and so on   your weakest points are when going to a higher step you have to change the steps so it works with your salary statistics so you have most people under a step to motivate them to go to the next instead of having them exactly above one step as you can see with a step model you just put a on the commission model but make it more attractive what the seller think is that they have a fixed salary if a seller is happy he she is selling a lot     i have also had a criteria saying that if you can keep at 1 step for more than 3 months you will start there each month then it 's up to the team leader to warn if that seller is good or just lucky

you 're conflating llc with corporation they 're different animals llc does not have s or c designations those are just for corporations i think what you 're thinking about is electing pass through status with the irs this is the easiest way to go the company can pay you at irregular intervals in irregular amounts the irs does n't care about these payments the company will show profit or loss at the end of the year those payments to you are n't expenses and do n't reduce your profit you report this on your schedule c and pay tax on that amount your state tax authority will have its own rules about how this works alternatively you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation i do n't know of a good reason why someone in your situation would do this but i 'm not an accountant so there may be reasons out there my recommendation is to get an accountant to prepare your taxes at least once if your situation is the same next year you can use the previous year 's forms to figure out what you need to fill in the investment of a couple hundred dollars is worthwhile on the question of buying a home in the next couple of years yes it does affect things pass through status probably does n't affect much if all of your income is coming from self employment be prepared for hassles when you are shopping for a mortgage you can ask around maybe you have a friendly loan officer at your credit union who knows your history but in general they will want to see at least two years of self employment tax returns you can plan for this in advance talk to a couple of loan officers now to see what the requirements will be that way you can plan to be ready when the time comes

going into a business with the potential to grow is the high risk high reward option if it pans out you could do but there 's a very real chance you 'll work like a dog for years and have nothing to show for it at the end other than debt even if the business is successful if you are n't careful with the structure you might not benefit   do all the research you can so you can understand the risks and opportunities as much as possible then you can evaluate whether it 's worth it   welding is something you can always go back to if the business does n't pan out if you go with the business plan have some criteria for success or failure do n't end up caught in the sunk costs fallacy if the business is n't going to provide a better life than working pull the plug early

that 's a dumb thesis for klarman if it 's what he 's doing   what history shows is that new investors are very interested in the total debt payments you are on the hook for    the higher your debt payments the less room there is for new payments      you clear off all debts people are more excited to lend because it 's the previous lenders that got the pain   it 's gambling   i really have no idea what klarman is doing we just know what happened with the situation    if klarman is not demanding 100 face value of the bonds but something not too much more than what he bought them for then who cares    there 's a reasonable function of debt where the debt holder who does n't want to deal with a long term repayment plan sells the debt to be out of the stress and the guy taking it on knows he will get an amount more that is a function of being willing to wait things out    it should n't be a amount more though   otherwise the original investor is an idiot for not waiting

credit cards are often more fool proof against over drawing consider bill has solid cash flow but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest an account that does n't have a card but is accessible via online banking bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending much of which comes out automatically e.g. rent utilities some of which he spends as needed eg shopping lunch on top of the day to day money bill keeps an overhead amount so if something happens he does n't overdraw the account which would incur significant fees now bill sees that the giant tv he has been saving for is on sale half price and there is just one left it costs more than he would normally spend in a week much more but bill knows that his pay should have just gone in and his rent not yet come out plus the overhead he keep in the account so there is money in his debit account when he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings after all the tv is what he was saving for what bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated and that his pay is going to go in a day late so now he might have over drawn the account buying the tv or maybe that was fine but paying the rent over draws the account now he has a overdraft fee probably on the order of $ 50 most banks at least where i am will happily allow you to overdraw you account giving you a loan at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee they do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the non assessed loan sometimes if you ask they do n't let you do it with your own eg buying the tv but they do let you do it on automated eg the rent on the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card they know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take if bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card then it would have just bounced at the cash register and bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money there are many ways you can accidentally overdraw your account particularly if it is a shared account

in short if your expenses rise with inflation but your income does not your expenses will eventually exceed your income as the article on perpetuities says a perpetuity is an annuity that pays forever   an annuity is a financial arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often for a period of time   hence a perpetuity is an arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often until you die   since the sum is fixed in nominal dollars or other currency units it will become worth less and less in real dollars as time goes on which is what will erode your financial independence to adapt the example from the article that you quote if you buy an annuity that will pay you $ 101 per month and your expenses are $ 100 per month you may seem to be financially independent   however if inflation is 2 per year then next year your expenses will be $ 102 but the annuity will still only pay you $ 100   at that point you will no longer be financially independent since the annuity no longer covers your expenses there are some senses in which the article 's statement is inaccurate in practical terms e.g. annuities need not always have fixed payments but may be adjusted for inflation also there are n't many real perpetuities in existence anyway and plus it does n't matter whether the source of the income is an annuity or something else but that is the gist of what the article is saying

firstly it is n't so generous   it is a win win but the bank does n't have to mail me a free box of checks with my new account or offer free printing to compete for my business   they already have the infrastructure to send out checks so the actual cost for my bank to mail a check on my behalf is pretty minimal   it might even save them some cost and reduce exposure   all the better if they do n't actually mail a check at all per my bank individuals and most companies you pay using send money will be mailed    a paper check your check is guaranteed to arrive by the delivery date    you choose when you create the payment a select number of companies very large corporations such as telecoms    utilities and cable companies are part of our electronic biller    network and will be paid electronically these payments arrive within    two business days so the answer to your question depend on what kind of bill pay you used   if it was an electronic payment there is n't a realistic possibility the money is n't cashed if your bank did mail a paper check the same rules would apply as if you did it yourself   i suppose it would be up to the bank   when i checked with my bank 's support this was their answer therefore per this answer do personal checks expire us it is really up to your bank whether or not they allow the check to be cashed at a later date   if you feel the check is n't cashed quickly enough you would have to stop payment and contact whoever you were trying to pay and perhaps start again   or ask them to hustle and cash the check before you stop it finally i would bet a dime that your bank does n't pre fund your checks   they are just putting a hold on the equivalent money in your account so you do n't overdraw   that is the real favor they do for you   if you stopped the check your money would be and available edit please read the comment about me losing a dime seems credible

you are on the right path but this is actually an equivalent annual cost problem you have to take it a step further and divide the npv by the annuity factor   you need to calculate the annuity factor and divide the investment by that amount     annuity factor = /r    we know the annual cost of the the current forklift = $ 5k. we need to figure out the equivalent annual cost of the new forklift   investment annuity factor + annual cost =    therefore $ 20 k 1 ^ 10 0.04 = $ + annual maintenance = $ therefore it makes sense to replace the old machine

gt;the correct solution is to   i do nt think there is a correct solution   however i d like to see major reform with financial aid recipient selection   right now the programs pretty effectively select the worst students   it should be treated as an investment instead   if the goal is to produce productive members of society they should aim to produce productive members of society   require an essay on long term goals career path etc   look at past performance strongly some but not too much emphasis on hs grades more on outside interests activities etc and most importantly how that past performance will serve them in the field they are trying to get into   obviously put extra subsidies on things like education somebody who may be incapable of graduating with an accounting degree could still get an education degree with close to a 4.0   if we turn too many dummies away from education we wo nt have enough teachers   have a 30 minute interview with all of the to determine their chances of having a positive return on society through taxes paid over their lives value added to the community etc and decide from there   make sure to focus on people with a passion for their industry   parental income should have almost no impact except for the ultra rich whose parents bring home an income of half a mil or something like that   edit   i forgot to make this post relevant to the op   the schools that people are applying to should be a major factor   do nt waste money sending people to schools that are a bad match for profit schools schools without a strong program in their intended degree   also put a lot of negative emphasis on things like art majors   there is no reason for the gov't to send some idiot to art school if they are nt an absolute star   i go to a art school and i do nt know a single art or theater major that has found more success through attending a 4 year program than they could have just using those 4 years to improve themselves and to hunt down their job

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

firstly and this part is rather opinion based i would absolutely not think of making more pension contributions when you are currently totaling 6 of salary as over contributing there are some who argue that you should be putting a minimum of 20 away for retirement throughout your working life you do n't say how old you are how close to retirement you are but a common rule of thumb is to halve your age and put away that of your salary into your pension so i would certainly start with upping those contributions   i actually do n't think it makes much difference whether you go for just your workplace pension versus a separate private one in general you end up paying management fees that are a of the value so whether it is in one place or split does n't cost any less the all eggs in one basket syndrome is a possible argument but equally if you change jobs a few times and end up with half a dozen pension pots it can be very hard to stay on top of them all if you end up with everything in one pot and then transfer it when you change jobs it 's easier to manage other options    isa as you mentioned on the plus side these are tax free on the minus side you can either go for a cash isa which at the moment has very low rates of return and/or a stocks and shares isa which exposes you to risks in the stock market    if you have debt consider paying it off early overpaying student loans may or may not be the exception to this depending on your personal situation certainly if you have a mortgage you can save a vast amount by overpaying early    other investments stocks and shares btl housing fine wines bitcoin there are almost limitless possibilities but it makes sense to max out the tax efficient options before you look into these

that happens all the time the best situation for this to happen is when you have several products each a bit better and a bit more expensive than the other and you add a new product which is the cheapest that gets people into the store to look at the cheapest product and then you show the the next more expensive which is so much better for only a little more money and the next more expensive which is again so much better you might not sell any of the cheapest product but it helps you sell the others   also happens the other way round you add a really expensive item unaffordable for most customers that is really really nice then customers look at it and you show them that for half the price they can have something that is almost as nice the expensive product increases the amount that customers think is the right price for that kind of product a customer might think that $ 2,000 for a diamond ring is an awful lot of money but if you show them another ring for $ 5,000 then suddenly the $ 2,000 does n't look that expensive anymore and if it is almost as nice as the $ 5,000 ring you sell a lot of rings for $ 2,000 because you had the more expensive ring in the store

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

in the terms of profit you 're most likely not going to make any the other posters had good suggestions about donating and i say the same    the fact that you had no business insurance leads me to believe that you may just have an expensive hobby and not an actual business talk to your accountant tax preparer and see what and how much loss can be deducted although that does n't help in the present    this is a hard lesson to learn but i hope it sticks always have business insurance especially in an area such as yours where hurricanes are relatively normal it 's absurdly foolish and unacceptable not to have insurance    i hope all works out

while you want it to grow faster than inflation there are things like i bonds that can carry some inflation protection with them for an idea that may make sense for part of this there are now some more details and i 'd think this seems alright initially though i would suggest considering having some kind of on going plan to handle periodically seeing how much more to invest here and what kind of taxes will this generate for you as taxable accounts can carry a mix of dividends interest and capital gains that you may have to pay even though you did n't see the gain yourself keep in mind that if you do go with a big name investment bank this could well add more fees as well as other stuff   lehman brothers was a big name investment bank once upon a time and they went broke   while you may want to be hands off i 'd still suggest having some kind of timeline for how often are your investments to be reviewed and things re allocated   each quarter semi annually or annual   there is n't so much a right or wrong answer here as much as i 'd point out that one should be aware of the trade offs in each case   if you take annual and wonder each week how it is doing then something a bit more frequent may make sense   on the other hand some people may well set it and forget it which can work as long as there is something to know about where to go if something does go broke   as these are managed investments the sipc check i 'd make may not hold though this would be the equivalent of fdic for deposits when dealing with securities the reit can be useful for diversification sure   you do realize that there may be some interesting taxes for you in the next few years given the nature of a reit investment right   the return of capital that a reit may pass through as a reit to maintain its tax status must distribute 90 of its net income each year that can be quite a off shoot of funds   where would those proceeds be invested   this is n't mentioned in your post and thus i 'm curious as if the reit passes out a dividend yield of say 5 then this is $ that could go somewhere

i think there are actually two separate questions here will provider a allow me to transfer only part of an isa product to provider b while keeping the other part in provider a. only provider a can answer this will hmrc rules allow me to keep making payments to the part that remained in provider a. i do n't have a definitive source for this but in my experience where the isa rules have been unclear about particular edge cases and i have asked hmrc similar questions directly their answer has always been that they will look at the situation in the round at the end of the tax year they get summaries from the providers and as long as you have n't attempted to double benefit or otherwise get around the limits they wo n't have an issue with it

in the uk you have an allowance of £ 40,000 per annum for tax relief into a pension this amount includes both your and your employer 's contributions if you earn more than £ 150,000 per annum this allowance starts to reduce and if you earn less than the allowance your allowance is limited to what you earn you can also carry over unused allowance from up to 3 years previously if you stick within this allowance you wo n't pay tax on your pension contributions if you go over the excess will be subject to tax salary exchange normally lets you avoid the national insurance value of your contribution being taxed if you paid your own money into your pension without going through salary exchange your contributions would have the 20 basic rate of tax credited to them and if you 're a higher rate taxpayer you could reclaim the difference between the basic rate of tax and the higher rate of tax you pay but the national insurance you 've paid on your own money would not be you ca n't get the money back you 've paid into your pension till you are are 58 given that you are 27 now the minimum age has risen from its historic 55 for your age group   that 's the pension trade off you forgo tax now in the expectation that once retired you will be paying tax at a lower rate because your income will be lower and you are much less likely to be subject to higher rate taxation in return for locking in your money till you 're older your pension income will be subject to tax when you eventually take it there are other options such as isas which have lower annual limits £ 20,000 currently and on which your contributions do not attract tax relief but which are not taxed as income when you eventually spend them isas and pensions are not mutually exclusive so if you have the money you can do both it 's up to you to determine what mix of savings will be appropriate to generate income for your eventual retirement if you are living in some other country when you retire your pension will be paid net of uk tax you might then be able to claim or pay any difference between that and your local tax rate depending on what agreement exists between the uk government and the other country 's government

the price gaps up because the offer is for a price above the current price therefore people want to buy now before the price jumps to the offer level of course it does depend on the tone of the announcement   which party is making the announcement and are they announcing an offer or a deal if the price is $ 10 and the offer is for $ 12 then the price may quickly jump the early buyers will make the most quick money they hope that the deal is done quickly or if not the final price ends up higher   there are risks the company could reject the offer the due diligence could expose a problem the regulators could reject the deal based on anti trust issues the deal could take many months to complete or the final deal could be for shares in the new company   the risks are one reason people sell after the deal offer is announced in other cases the seller finally is seeing a profit or a smaller loss and wants out while they can

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

i 'd put the 20 down close on the house live in it for a year and save the difference   if you find your cash flow is fine run a calculation and start on a program of prepaying a bit of principal each month as an extra payment if you study how amortization works you 'll understand that an extra payment of about 1/6 the amount due will knock off a full payment at the end this is how a 30 year mortgage starts out meanwhile you should keep in mind it 's easy to prepay the mortgage but there 's really no getting it back so before letting go of your money i 'd do a few things i may be stating the obvious but consider no matter how low the payment on your mortgage a payment is due each and every month until it 's paid off you put 80 down take a 10 year mortgage you still have payments for 10 years you want to insure yourself against needing to sell in a hurry if you both lose your jobs so whatever you put down i 'd recommend a healthy emergency account 9 12 months worth of expenses

dividends are a way of distributing profits from operating a business to the business owners why would you call it wasting money is beyond me decisions about dividend distribution are made by the company based on its net revenue and the needs of future capital in some jurisdictions the us for example the tax policy discourages companies from accumulating too much earnings without distributing dividends unless they have a compelling reason to do so stock price is determined by the market the price of a stock is neither expensive nor cheap on its own you need to look at the underlying company and the share of it that the stock represents in case of google according to some analysts the price is actually quite cheap the analyst consensus puts the target price for the next 12 months at $ vs. current $

i think fidelity has a very nice introduction to growth vs value investing that may give you the background you need   people love to put stocks in categories however the distinction is more of a range and can change over time jb king makes a good point that for most people the two stocks you mentioned would both be considered value right now as they are both stable companies with a significant dividend   you are correct though pfizer might be considered more growth a more drastic example would be the difference between target and amazon   both are retail companies that sell a wide variety of products   target is a value company a established company with stable revenues that uses its income to give a fairly stable dividend   amazon is a growth company that is reinvesting its revenues back into the corporation to grow itself as fast as possible    the price of the amazon stock reflects what people think will be future growth future income for the company   whereas target 's price appears to be based on the idea that future income will be similar to current income   you can see why growth companies like amazon might be more risky as that growth you paid a high price for may not be realized but the payout may be much higher as well

current account offers a lot of benefits for sole proprietors think of it like bank account for a company the bank provides a host of facilities for the company a sole proprietor does not have enough value as that of a company for a bank but needs similar services thus indian banks offer a down version of the account offered to a company current account offer very good overdraft withdrawing money even if balance is zero this feature is very useful as   business cycles and payment schedules can be different for each supplier customer the sole proprietor does business with imagine the sole proprietor account has balance of zero on day 0 customer x made payment by cheque on day 1 cheques will get credited only on day 3 assume day 2 is a national holiday or weekend   sole proprietor gave a cheque to his supplier on day 0 the supplier deposited the cheque on day 0 and the sole proprietor 's bank will debit the the proprietor 's account on day 1 as customer 's cheque will get credited only day 3 the overdraft facility will let the proprietor borrow from the bank interestingly current accounts were offered long before indian banks started   offering customized accounts to corporate customers the payment schedule mentioned in my example is based on a clearing system > 10 years ago systems have become much simpler now but banks have always managed to offer something significantly extra on lines similar to my example above to proprietor over a savings bank account

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

you remind me a lot of myself as i was thinking about marriage luckily for me my wife was much smarter about all this than i was hopefully i can pass along some of her wisdom both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other in marriage there is no more financial independence do not think in those terms life can throw so many curve balls that you will regret it imagine sitting down with your new bride and running through the math she is to contribute $ x to the family each month and you are to contribute $ y. then next thing you know 6 months later she has cancer and has to undergo expensive and debilitating treatment there is no way she can contribute her $ x anymore you tell her that is okay and that you understand but the pressure weighs down on her every day because she feels like she is not meeting your expectations   or alternatively everything goes great with your $ x $ y plan a few years down the road your wife is pregnant so you revisit the plan readjust etc everything seems great when your child is born however the baby has a severe physical or mental handicap you and your wife decide that she will quit her job to raise your beautiful child but the whole time in the back of her mind she ca n't get out of her head that she is no longer financially independent and not living up to your expectations these stresses are not what you want in your marriage here is what we do in my family hopefully some of this will be helpful to you every year my wife and i sit down and determine what our financial goals are for the year how much do we want to be putting in retirement how much do we want to give to charity do we want to take any family vacations we set goals together on what we want to achieve with our money there is no my money or her money just ours does n't matter where it comes from at the beginning of every month we create a budget in a spreadsheet it has categories like food mortgage or rent transportation clothing utilities and we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those it also has categories for entertainment retirement charity cell phones internet and so on again we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those in the spreadsheet we also track how much income we expect that month and our totals income minus expenses if that value is positive we determine what to do with the remainder maybe we save some for a rainy day or for car repairs maybe we treat ourselves to an extra fancy dinner the point is every dollar should be accounted for if she wants to go to dinner with some friends we put that in the budget if i want a new video game we put that in the budget once a week we take all our receipts and tally up where we spent our money we then see how we are doing on our budget maybe we were a little high in one category and lower than expected in another we adjust we are flexible but we go over our finances often to make sure we are achieving our goals some specific goals i 'd recommend that the two of you consider in your first such yearly meeting you get out of life what you put into it and you will get out of your finances what the two of you put into them by being on the same page your marriage will be much happier money finances are one of the top causes of divorce if you two are working together on this you are much more likely to succeed

in the past 10 years there have been mutual funds that would act as a single bucket of stocks and bonds a good example is fidelity 's four in one the trade off was a management fee for the fund in exchange for having to manage the portfolio itself and pay separate commissions and fees these days though it is very simple and pretty cheap to put together a basket of 5 6 etfs that would represent a balanced portfolio what s even more interesting is that large online brokerage houses are starting to offer commission free trading of a number of etfs as long as they are not day traded and are held for a period similar to ntf mutual funds   i think you could easily put together a basket of 5 6 etfs to trade on fidelity or td ameritrade commission free and one that would represent a nice diversified portfolio the main advantage is that you are not giving money to the fund manager but rather paying the minimal cost of investing in an index etf overall this can save you an extra .5 1 annually on your portfolio just in fees here are links to commission free etf trading on fidelity and td ameritrade

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

i live in the uk and along with my wife we both drive volkswagen cars a few factors vw is widely acknowledged as having some of the best diesel car engines   lot of people are questioning if diesel car will be outlawed management has just said they do n’t know what their workers are doing the usa has made it clear they will create pollution law in a way that benefit their own car makers    e.g. they do n’t care about co2 if not diesel cars then it needs hybrid or electric cars to get good mpg is not seen as a leader in these hybrid cars tend to be gas as diesel engines cost too much vw is no longer looking like a nice safe investment    i think vw will recover but it may get worse for them before it gets better trying to call the bottom of a stock is high risk

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

you did n't give enough information   what is your goal   what is your financial situation    a discount to buy company stock can seem very tempting   i was tempted by it myself gee almost 20 years ago   i still own some of the stock   but i held mutual funds first there are two disadvantages that have me from in the espp of my subsequent employers one of which was a spin out company of the stock issuing company the other having bought the spin out   first putting a bunch of money in a single stock is rather risky   single stocks will drop dramatically due to market conditions   generally market conditions do n't act so dramatically on all stock   second is it wise to put not only your salary but also your saved wealth all in one basket it worked out reasonably well for me   the stock doubled right before my division was spun out i sold half of my position     and the resulting stock has continued to provide opportunities to diversify   however it could have just as easily dropped in half instead of doubled what is your timeline for holding the stock for realizing any gain   can you afford patience if the stock value should drop in half i have co workers who continue to invest through our new company 's espp   at least one co worker has the stated goal to sell after every purchase he holds the stock long enough to make a long term gain instead of short term but he sells after every purchase   and it seems to him that the stock always drops right when he wants to sell

as 's answer recommends do n't give them the money make the checks payable to the credit card company or the bank that issued the student loan so that those debts get repaid for sure or else you run the risk of that money also going the way of all flesh and the debt remaining untouched next file a gift tax return form 709 which is not filed along with form 1040 all go to one irs office as described in the instructions saying that you gave your son and daughter in law gifts of $ 20 k each say and that you want to have $ 12 k excess of each gift over and above the annual exclusion of $ 14 k per recipient count against your combined lifetime estate tax and gift tax exclusion which is currently over $ 5 m so no gift tax needs to be paid as joetaxpayer 's comment points out if you are married and your spouse is willing to join in this then as much as $ 56 k can be given without anyone having to file form 709   then change your will to reduce your son 's and daughter in law 's inheritance by $ if and when they return the money as a gift to you change your will back   by removing the reduction if the repayment is is a lump sum the gift tax return can be used by your son and daughter in law while if they pay back over two years no gift tax return need be filed   so that 's it no interest to be paid by anybody no gift taxes to be paid by anybody no income to be reported on any tax return etc this will work unless you have serious concerns about reducing your combined lifetime estate tax and gift tax exclusion by $ 12 k and if you do you can afford to hire plenty of lawyers to advise you on better strategies

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

the sears ceo eddie lampert is an ayn rand fanatic   this is what happens when you take ayn rand newshour amp making sense column this is what happens when you take ayn rand seriously   in 2008 sears ceo eddie lampert decided to restructure the company according to rand 's principles   lampert broke the company into more than 30 individual units each with its own management and each measured separately for profit and loss the idea was to promote competition among the units which lampert assumed would lead to higher profits instead this is what happened as described by a reporter for bloomberg business   an advocate of free market economics and fan of the ayn rand he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results if the company 's leaders were told to act selfishly he argued they would run their divisions in a rational manner boosting overall performance   instead the divisions turned against each other and sears and kmart the overarching brands suffered interviews with more than 40 former executives many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company paint a picture of a business that 's by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources   a close up of the debacle was described by stuart in a salon article from 2013   it got crazy executives started undermining other units because they knew their bonuses were tied to individual unit performance they began to focus solely on the economic performance of their unit at the expense of the overall sears brand one unit kenmore started selling the products of other companies and placed them more prominently than sears own products units competed for ad space in sears units were no longer incentivized to make sacrifices like offering discounts to get shoppers into the store   sears became a miserable place to work rife with infighting and screaming matches employees focused solely on making money in their own unit ceased to have any loyalty to the company or stake in its survival   we all know the end of the story sears share prices fell and the company appears to be headed toward bankruptcy the moral of the story in 's words   what lampert failed to see is that humans actually have a natural inclination to work for the mutual benefit of an organization they like to cooperate and collaborate and they often work more productively when they have shared goals take all of that away and you create a company that will destroy itself

you might consider learning how the matching or pairing system in the market operates   the actual exchange only happens when both a buyer and a seller overlap their respect quotes    sometimes orders go to market for a particular volume   eg get me 10,000 microsoft shares now   which means that the price starts at the current lowest seller and works up the price list until the volume is met   like all market it trades it has it 's advantages and it 's dangers   if you are confident microsoft is going to bull you want those shares now confident you 'll recoup the cost   where if you put in a priced order you might get only none or some shares same as when you sell   if you see the price which is the price of the last completed successful trade   and think i 'm going to sell 1000 shares then you give the order to the market or broker and then the same as what happened as before   the highest bidder gets as much as they asked for if there 's still shares left over they go to the next bidder and so on down the price and the last completed successful trade is when your last sale is made at the lowest price of your batch if you 're selling and selling 100,000 shares and the highest bidder wants 1,000,000 shares you 'll only see the price drop to that guys bid   why will it drop off the quoted price   because the quoted price is the last sale clearly if there 's someone still with an open bid on the market then either he wants more shares than were available the price stays same or his bid was n't as high as the last bid so when you sale goes through it will be at the price he 's offering    which is why being able to see the price queues is important on large traders it is also why it can be important put stops and limits on your trades een through you can still get gapped if you 're unlucky   however putting prices open orders vs orders can mean that you 're sitting there waiting for a bounce spike while the action is all going on without you safer but not as much gain maybe that 's the excitement of the market for every option there 's advantages and risks eg missing out there are also issues with stock movement and stop hunting which can influence the price but the stuff in the long paragraphs is the technical reasons

since you seem to be interested in investing in individual stocks this answer will address that   as for the general question of investing the answer that @johnfx gave is just about as good as it gets investing in individual stocks is extremely risky and takes a lot of work to do right   on top of the fairly obvious need to research a stock before you buy there is the matter of keeping up with the stocks to know when you need to sell as well as myriad other facets of investing   paid professionals spend all day every day doing this and they have a hard time beating an index fund   unless you take the time to educate yourself and are willing to continually put in a good bit of effort i would advise you to stay away from individual stocks and rely on mutual funds

this is great news   evs are growing so fast   their reduced fuel and maintenance costs will be a great boon to the economy   i would n't be surprising to see evs take a significant share of the auto market in the coming years they were ~1 in 2016   innovation drives economic growth   it 's also good for the environment the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline diesel and electrical grid increased demand that 's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements

all forms of liquid investing necessarily have the same expected value if any one form were more profitable money would flood in equalizing it day trading is unusual in two key ways first although the expected value is the same the risk profile is very different for example would you wager a dollar on the flip of a coin   you might   why not after all would you wager a million dollars   probably not the risk is too great similarly day trading can easily lose you all of your investment which is why you should be careful doing it in his liar 's poker michael lewis tells an anecdote about a rich bond trader who proposes a million dollar even money bet with his rival an amount both could just barely afford to lose   the rival not wanting to play but not wanting to lose face by declining accepted with the that the stakes be raised to 10 million dollars the trader backed down also the efficient market only guarantees the price will be efficient   it says nothing about transaction costs   a busy day trader can easily incur thousands in commission and other fees

you ca n't actually transfer shares directly unless they were obtained as part of an employee share scheme see the answers to questions 19 and 20 on this page q. can i put shares from my employee share scheme into my isa a. you can transfer any shares you get from into a stocks and shares component of an isa without having to pay    capital gains tax provided your isa manager agrees to take them the    value of the shares at the date of transfer counts towards the annual    limit this means you can transfer up to £ worth of shares in the tax    year 2013 14 assuming that you make no other subscriptions to isas    in those years you must transfer the shares within 90 days from the day they cease to    be subject to the plan or for approved share option schemes 90    days of the exercise of option date your employer should be able to    tell you more q. can i put windfall or inherited shares in my isa a. no you can only transfer shares you own into an isa if they have    come from an employee share scheme otherwise the isa manager must    purchase shares on the open market the situation is the same if you have shares that you have inherited    you are not able to transfer them into an isa

gt are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   yes a good question i 'm sure that a grid scale natural gas plant is better than distributed as it will have higher efficiency and better maintenance but i can see that the overhead of the grid needs to be maintained too may be too big economically and people may decide to drop of the grid entirely   where i live natural gas is not that widespread outside the cities so this is probably not viable to most people on the other hand we already today get 15 of your electricity from hydro storage so on a national level we are not too far from the presumed 20 however currently the pumped hydro storage plants have economic problems because solar is eating their traditional high price peak around lunch time

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

yes you will need an emergency fund for the rental besides appliances or a roof that might need to be replaced you will also have to protect against being unable to rent the unit   another risk is that you may have a tenant damage the unit while you can get the money through the courts it may take months or longer you ca n't wait for the money before you repair the unit keeping the rental unit funds separate from the rest of your funds will allow you to make sure you are adequately protecting yourself

the brokerage firm will purchase shares for the dividend paid in a account for the security of the issuer and then they will distribute fractional shares among all their clients that chose div reinvest   they will only have to buy 1 extra share to account for the fractional portion of what they allocate   the structure of the market does not permit trading of fractional shares there is generally not any impact to the market place for div reinvest with the exception of certain securities that pay large dividends that are not liquid sometimes this occurs in   preferred securities where a large amount of div reinvestment could create a large market order that has market impact   most brokers place market orders for the opening on the day following the payment of the dividend when you sell the fractional portion same process as full shares are sold into the market and the fractional if traded between you and the brokers account   if it creates a full share for the broker has .6 shares and you sell him .5 they would likely flip that out to the street with the full share portion of your order this would not have impact to outstanding shares and all cost are operational and with the broker handling the div reinvestment service

the fluctuation of interest rates during the next year could easily dwarf the savings this attempt to improve your credit score will have or the reverse is true will the loan improve your score enough to make a difference it will not change the number of months old your oldest account is it will increase the breadth of your accounts applying for the car loan will result in a short term decrease in the score because of the hard pull the total impact will be harder to predict   a few points either way will generally not have an impact on your rate you will also notice the two in your question differ by more than 30 points you ca n't control which number the lender will use you also have to realize the number differs every day depending on when they pull it that month the addition of a car loan assuming you still have the loan when you buy the house will not have a major impact on your ability to get afford the home mortgage the bank cares about two numbers regarding monthly payments the amount of your mortgage including principal interest taxes and insurance and the amount of all other debt payments car loan school loans credit cards the number should be no more than of your monthly income the other payments no more than 10   if the auto loan payments fit in the 10 window then the amount of money you can spend each month on the mortgage will not be impacted if it is too large then they will want to see a smaller amount of your income to go to if you buy the car either by cash or by loan after you apply for the mortgage they will be concerned because you are impacting directly numbers they are using to evaluate your financial health i have experienced a delay because the buyer bought a car the week before closing the biggest impact on your ability to get the loan is the greater than 20 down payment assuming you can still do that if you pay cash for the car   do n't deplete your savings to get to the 50 down payment level keep money for closing costs moving expenses furnishing plus other emergencies make it clear that you can easily cover the 20 level and are willing to go higher to make the loan numbers work

this is a great question i 've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 + years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me i 've lived off these businesses for 20 + years so i know it can be done first let me start by saying that the rules regulations requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally for the most part are local laws and regulations depending on what your business does you may have some federal rules to follow but for the most part it will be your locality state county city that determines what you 'll have to do to comply and be legal also though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances you do n't always have to there are many small businesses think etc that get income from their business operations and do so as individuals of course everyone has to pay taxes so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year you are income tax legal   i wo n't try to answer the income tax question here though as that can be a big question also though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below when it comes to taxes i definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if it 's something like h&r block or jackson etc in some cities there might even be free tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses in general income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing i 've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they 're required to in essence they are overpaying running a business and making a profit can be hard enough so on to of that you do n't need to be paying more than you are required to   also i am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you that you wo n't have a payroll that is another area that can be complicated for sure ok with those generics out of the way let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business since you have the idea for your business pretty figured out will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government not necessarily since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work you can certainly research this on your own it might take a little time but it 's doable if you stick with it some resources the state of florida where i live has an excellent page at you might not be in florida but almost every state will have something similar what all do i need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business   all of the answers above still apply to this question but here are a few more items to consider you will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business if you license some content stock images for example you 'll want to document receipts these are easy usually as you know directly if you subscribe to the apple developer program which you 'll need to if you intend to sell apps in the apple app stores the subscription is an expense against your business income etc you will want to keep good records of indirect costs these are not so easy to figure out and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these what do i mean well you need an office in order to produce your work right you might need a computer a phone internet electricity heat etc all of which allow you to create a working environment that allows you to produce your product the irs and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and count them as legitimate business expenses no you ca n't use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home and the entire bill is not just for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense again i do n't want to get too far down the income tax rabbit hole but you still need to keep track of what you spend you must keep good record of all your income this is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll gifts from friends business income from clients and/or the app stores etc do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit but you do n't really know where that money came from unless you are tracking it the good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like quicken or quickbooks or many many other such popular programs you will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses especially home based businesses depending on your business activity you might want to consider business liability insurance again this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you 'll be dealing with some might require you to have some insurance   will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in   this might be a legal accountant question as to the very specific answer from the pov of the law and taxing authorities however consider that not all businesses make any money at all for a long time and they definitely are a business for instance twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business again deferring to the attorneys cpas here for the legal answer the practical answer is that you 're performing some business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen i would consider acting as a business regardless what things do i need to do up front and what things can i defer to later especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in this question 's answer could be quite long there are potentially many items you can defer   however one i can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation an individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations for tax purposes this is sometimes referred to as schedule c income i 'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues but i am saying that it 's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses having said that this too can be easy to do on your own many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars if you do incorporate as a small business of one person i would definitely consider a tax concept called an s corp to avoid paying double taxes but here too we 've gone down the tax rabbit hole again

while this is a totally personal decision i still think it would be a good idea to have some life insurance simply because you have someone that is currently dependent on your income   yes you have about 22 years in retirement but if you consider taxes and market risk there 's still some uncertainty there    also while your wife may be willing and able to work now will she want to do that for years just to earn living expenses    i would look at the costs on 10-year term life insurance and see if it 's worth the extra peace of mind to you and your wife   if your wife is fine with using your retirement as life insurance then you can probably be ok without it so to answer the question it may be acceptable but it 's generally a very cheap way to get a lot of peace i would not worry too much about the opinions of your parents unless they are going to pay for the insurance it 's your decision

property taxes where they exist are generally levied by cities counties and other local level administrative bodies like and are the primary source of revenue at these levels of government these taxes pay the lion 's share of the expenses for basic services provided by a city or county there are federal dollars other revenue sources state lottery revenues often go toward public schools for instance and usage fees vehicle registration utility bills toll roads at play as well but a lot of that money covers larger scale infrastructure development freeways and specialized political involving this bridge or that dam in a 's home district a few national initiatives from the president 's budget like first technology upgrades for improved disaster terrorism property taxes are the main funding for the day to day government operations at the most visible level to the average resident the theory behind using a property tax instead of some other form of taxation like income is that the value of the property and the quality of services provided to the of that property are the property is valuable in part because the infrastructure is well maintained and nearby schools hospitals are good and by the same token affluent residents expect high quality services property taxes are also easier to levy because most of the work can be done by the tax assessor monitor recent sale prices do drive through neighborhoods come up with a number and send the resident the bill that 's opposed to sales taxes which businesses operating in the jurisdiction have to calculate collect and turn over or income taxes which require residents to fill out paperwork to calculate how much they owe the justification is eminent domain it 's very simple when you buy land in the u.s. and a state thereof you are still a citizen and/or resident of that state and the u.s. and subject to their laws you 're not creating your own country when you buy a house as such the government charges you for the facilities and services they provide in your area and your state which are then your privilege to use obviously roads are n't free a one mile stretch behind my house is costing the county $ 15 million to expand it from to here 's the kicker you 've already been paying these taxes you think your landlord 's just going to take the property taxes for the whole apartment complex on the chin he 's out to make money and doing that requires charging a sufficient amount to cover costs including taxes he incurs you just never see allocated property taxes as an item on your rent statement just like you do n't see allocated mortgage allocated facilities maintenance allocated gross margin etc you know you 're getting shafted paying someone else 's financing with a little extra on the side to boot that 's why you want a house unfortunately not being able to pay these taxes is a reality for some people old and young and government generally does n't go easy on delinquent homeowners after medical bills and mortgage delinquency property tax delinquency is the number three reason for bankruptcy and only a mortgage or property tax delinquency can cause your home to be seized and sold well that and using it for criminal enterprise but unless you 're running a meth lab in your half million dollar home or financing it with coke money i would n't worry about that score retirement planners figure property taxes into cost of living and they do often advise a downgrade from the house you raised your children in to something smaller for many reasons including lower taxes there really is n't a way to structure a completely pay as you go metropolitan area and you would n't want to live in it if there were imagine every strip of asphalt in the county being a toll road where your ez pass etc or license plate was scanned and you were billed at each intersection in addition to being a huge invasion of privacy the cost to maintain this network and your cost to use it would skyrocket imagine 911 asking for a credit card number before police fire or ems ambulance services already do bill on a per event basis but you 'd be surprised how few people pay and how little power a county ems has to enforce collection without a property tax and medicaid to cover the difference ems service could not be provided in most counties

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

honestly i see we do n't see eye to eye but i ca n't put my finger on it   take the american heart association for example you mention people who were n't middle class might not know who they are i did n't get to eat at a sandwich restaurant for the first time until right before i graduated high school i was so happy when i got to eat that first sandwich someone else made and then when i saw the american heart association logo on the menu i just assumed it was healthy i did n't need previous experience   perhaps my example seems like something a middle class person would do because i grew up to be middle class and the things i did wrong are things i thought middle class people did to most of my point all that is irrelevant when you are poor no one wants to give you advice when you are middle class the advice you can afford is not good but it presents itself as good when you are well off everyone wants to take advantage of you and good advice is hard to discern from poor advice   your use of the phrase the system is interesting to me under no circumstances would i advocate the system be trusted in fact in my mind what i 've described is the system accidentally but perfectly preparing people to be unable to socioeconomic status because we were prepare people to think the haves are lucky as opposed to teaching the have notes how to establish a plan such that their children will have opportunities and their grand children will be well off and their great grand children will be rich

other answers did n't seem to cover it but most 0 bank loans often offered to credit card holders in the form of balance transfer checks aside from less obvious fees like already mentioned late fees also charge an actual loan fee typically 2 3 or a minimum floor amount that was the deal with every single transfer 0 offer i ever saw from a bank so effectively even if you pay off the loan perfectly on time and within 0 period you still got a 3 loan and not 0 assuming 0 period lasts 12 months which is often the case

pretty simple actually this is a state run defined benefit plan where the benefit is calculated based on the length of the employment and the contributed amounts this is what in the us is known as the social security   this is a defined contribution plan where the employee can chose the level of risk based on certain pre defined investment guidelines more conservative or more aggressive in poland it appears that there 's a certain amount of the state mandated ss tax is transferred to these plans nothing in the us is like that but you can see it as a mandatory ira with a preset limited choice of mutual funds to invest into as an analogy the recent change was to reduce the portion of the contribution that is diverted to this plan from to 2.3 on account of expanding the contribution to 1 probably the recent crashes of the stock markets that affected these accounts lead to this decision this is voluntary defined contribution plan similar to the us 401ks this division is actually pretty common not unique to poland i 'd say its the standard pension scheme as opposed to what we 're used to in the us

a huge part of the problem is that low income people have been very heavily marketed to by the online and for profit colleges because they were eligible for financial aid mainly loans and were seen only as a straw through which to suck money out of the government by these schools because they were only interested in the money there was no attempt to qualify students in many of these schools or provide any support to them when students dropped out their counselors would keep signing them up for classes that they did n’t know about or attend    because a lot of the schools are bullshit schools with either no reputation or a poor one even those who finished were largely not able to get the high paying jobs they were promised in order to lure them in this goes for low income students especially ones whose families have no previous experience with post high school education across the board and all of this group is far more likely to default because they were basically ripped off got nothing useful from these bogus schools and were often outright defrauded and do not have the income they were told they would have when agreeing to the loans but because there is a higher percentage of minorities among this group they are more likely to be but our student loan system does n’t differentiate between loans for real and loans for these rip off schools so you are still 100 on the hook regardless even if they signed you up for several more worth of classes after you withdrew   it ’s a lot like the mortgage collapse desperate to keep making money the lenders targeted increasingly less qualified people who were also naive about the entire system and sold them terrible loans sometimes talking them out of more reasonable options and then when the whole thing starts to fail it ’s all because the government made the banks give mortgages to poor black people   the institutions suck up the money and leave bewildered poor people holding the bag now even poorer with nothing to show for the debt they will literally be digging out of forever    the obama administration finally took some steps to control the predatory for profit institutions and try to sort out who had been ripped off vs people who had genuinely received any useful education but of course the new sec of education is doing her best to roll all that back   and most of the victims are n’t teens either they are adults with kids who were trying to do something to better themselves and their lives and got screwed over some of these middle aged people will literally be having their social security garnished to pay for these loans it ’s disgusting and even more so to say it ’s all affirmative action

basically no you have retirement plan options and can either go with a roth option which wo n't change your current tax burden or go with a traditional plan which is tax deductible   but wo n't change your business deductions or self employment taxes this article has an explanation of options for setting up sep or solo 401k plans key quote for all the pre tax retirement plans because pre tax employer and employee contributions are deducted in    the same way neither one is more tax efficient than the other the article goes on to say that if you were an s corp or llc that elected to be taxed as an s corp a solo 401(k plan would allow the business to make an employer contribution to your 401(k and even then there 's no tax advantage to the employer contribution conclusion for s corps employer contributions would reduce the amount of income from the s corporation that    would be passed through to you as the owner thereby reducing your    income tax but because this income is not subject to payroll taxes    in the first place these contributions will not reduce your payroll    taxes

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

its different because at least with both stock options and futures the product is going to eventually get that money   the difference is that you do n't have to spend that money directly on that product right now allowing you to invest far more then you can afford since you are going to cover that option or sell that contract long before you are ever going to be on hook for actually buying all those stocks or barrels of oil you were trading   it 's actually a good way for a middle class investor to become really wealthy because if he is good all he needs is to save only about 10,000 to invest and he can invest like he 's investing 100,000   obviously there 's more risk too but give and take i guess

even if the price of your home did match inflation or better and that 's a question i 'll let the other answers address i propose that owning a home by itself is not a sufficient hedge against inflation consider inflation will inflate your living expenses if you 're lucky they 'll inflate at the average if you 're unlucky a change in your spending patterns perhaps age related could result in your expenses rising faster than inflation look at the sub indexes of the cpi without income also rising with inflation or better how will you cope with rising living expenses each passing year advancing living expenses risk a static income your home is an illiquid asset generally speaking it neither generates income for you nor can you sell only a portion at best owning your principal residence helps you avoid a rent expense and inflation in rents but rent is only one of many living expenses some consider a reverse mortgage an option to tap home equity but it has a high cost in other words if you do n't want to be forced to liquidate sell your home you 'll also need to look at ways to ensure your income sources rise with inflation i.e. look at your cash flow not just your net worth hence investing in housing as in your own principal residence is not an adequate hedge against inflation if you owned additional properties to generate rental income and you retained pricing power so you could increase the rent charged at least in line with inflation your situation would be somewhat improved except you would perhaps be adopting another problem too high a concentration in a single asset class consequently i would look at ways other than housing to hedge against inflation consider other kinds of investments safe as houses may be a but it is no guarantee

if you look at the definition of time value on wikipedia you may notice this line time value can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside   you are right to think that the time value is increasing as the increases from deeply otm to atm once the crosses the strike price threshold per wiki 's interpretation the upside potential decreases as the underlying price moves away from the strike price think it as if an option is already deep in the money the chance of it getting further itm is slim hence the willingness to pay for that chance aka the upside potential decreases

you already got good answers on why you ca n't buy a toyota from the factory but my answer is regarding to the implied second part of your question how to avoid haggling i found a good way to avoid the haggling at a car dealership can be simply to not haggle go in with a different attitude the main reason car dealers list inflated prices and then haggle is that they expect the customers to haggle it is fundamentally based on distrust on both sides treat the sales person as your advisor your business partner as somebody you trust as an expert in his field and you 'll be surprised how the experience changes of course make sure that the trust is justified sales reps have a fine line to walk of course they like to sell a car for more money but they also do not want a reputation of overcharging customers they 'd rather you recommend them to your friends and post good reviews on yelp in the end all reputable dealers effectively have a fixed price policy or close to it even those who do n't advertise it and even for used cars haggling just the process to get there and sales reps are people often people who hate the haggling part of their job as much as you do i was in the market for a new used car a few months ago in the end it was between two cars one of them a toyota both from the brand name dealer 's respective used car lots in both cases i went in knowing in advance what the car 's fair market value was and what i was willing to pay as well as details about the car mileage condition etc thanks to the internet both cars were marked significantly higher as soon as the sales rep realized that i was n't even trying to haggle the price dropped to the fair value i did n't even have to ask for it the rep even offered some extras thrown into the deal things i had n't even asked for things like towing my old car to the junk yard

closing the card will be fine the consequences are related to your available credit and actual potential utilization if you have less total credit any credit you actually use will be a greater percentage of your total credit manipulating your score downwards more greatly the next consequence will be related to the age of your credit history which is an average of your credit lines this seems negligible and also beneficial for you since your credit history is so young to begin with

you goal should be in rupees as you are earning in rupees and spending in rupees any other currency is of no value meaning    more than being worried about the usd inr rate you should be worried about inflation and savings rate this will change the amount that you need to save for your retirement the usd inr rate would anyways get reflected into some of the prices of some of the items and would get into inflation your savings goal should not be an arbitrary number it should have a purpose the purpose for saving goal could be to meet education in future wedding kids education vacation downpayment for house retirement etc   say your goal is to save enough for you masters degree that you plan to do after 3 years say as of today you find the cost fees book etc is rs 100,000 for you masters degree say additional rs 100,000 for your stay food expenses so essentially you need to save rs 200,000 in next 3 years however here is the catch in 3 years time the inflation around 10 may mean you need to save rs 200,000 1.1 = 220,000 at the end of first year and 220,000 1.1 = for second year and 1.1 = so essentially you need to save more if you run this in xls it will be easy to track and now at the end of 1st year whatever you have saved you may keep it in short term fixed deposits this would get you interest so effectively this calculation will tell you how much you need to save monthly for longer goals you may say decide to invest the money in shares ppf or other instruments the essential is same the returns that you are getting adds value and the inflation removes value

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

what are you using the analysis for if your analyzing your interest rate risk then you want to determine decay rates for your non maturity deposits assuming your bank uses software to produce your earnings at risk ear and economic value of equity eve metrics the decay rate assumptions make a big difference in those numbers most models have default assumptions that may not be correct for your institution and as a result are giving you ear and eve numbers that are not at all accurate    basically you want to have some analysis that proves how you are your 12 24 months are your deposits sticky or are they affected by small changes in interest rates you can look at historical numbers to determine how your deposits behave but be sure to go back more than 3 4 years as deposit behavior has been pretty abnormal since 2008 with rates near zero similarly you may want to try and identify surge deposits that came into your bank due to the low rate environment and as soon as rates rise they will move into higher earning assets stocks bond money markets

a reason that the wealth has never and will never trickle down is because as society goes on the wealth transfer only happens between upper tiers of society   it used to be that the rich would spend their money and many people would benefit from it in a society small business owners were pretty much all their were and the only people who had monopolies were the rail and oil lines   as time went on more major organizations up for news food computers etc now wealth transfers only between the top tiers and the lower tiers only get the crumbs the higher tier chooses to pay them which is significantly less than they used to whereas employees used to cost a reasonable value to a company they are now almost entirely expendable assets exceptions made for certain portions of history   i am of the opinion that much like history the cycle is going to repeat shortly the occupy wall street being a precursor to another wage fight between the rich and poor with the dissemination of knowledge being much easier more people are getting the general idea that they 're getting shafted they want to be rich although not necessarily because the rich are wealthy they simply want to be able to increase their class mobility that 's been dying a slow death for the past 20 years and quite by the bank bail out   it 's unfortunate a sizable portion of the population actually sides with the 1 of people actively preventing them from moving up gaining more mobility and improving the quality of their life i sincerely hope that at some point in the near future people realize this before the lower class goes and starts busting heads

the time value decay is theoretically constant   in reality it is driven by supply and demand just like everything else in the market    for instance if a big earnings announcement is coming out after the close for the day you may see little or no time decay in the price of the options during the day before also while in theory options have a set value as related to the trading price of the underlying security that does not mean there will always be a buyer willing to pay a premium as they come close to expiration in the last few minutes you ca n't forget to account for the transaction fees associated with buying the options or the risk factor involved    it is rare but there are times i 've actually had to sell in the money calls at a penny or two less than they 're actually worth at the time just to unload them in the last few minutes before the market closed on expiration day

oftentimes the lender the owner of the security is not explicitly involved in the lending transaction let 's say the broker is holding a long term position of 1mm shares from client a. it is common for client a 's agreement with broker a to include a clause that allows the broker to lend out the 1mm shares for its own profit client a may be compensated for this in some form e.g. baked into their financing rates but they do not receive any compensation that is directly tied to lending activities you also have securities lending agents that lend securities for an explicit fee for example the borrower 's broker may not have sufficient inventory in which case they would need to find a third party lending agent this happens both on demand as well as for a fixed terms typically a large basket of securities securities lending and borrowing is a business in its own right   i 'm not sure i follow your follow up question but oftentimes there is no restriction that prevents the broker from lending out shares for a very short time unless there is a transaction based fee though the number of times you lend shares does not affect pocketing the interest since interest accrues as a function of time

after completing 4 years of undergrad in accounting i was planning to complete my ca but i have n't been able to get a job with one of the big four here in canada currently working in corporate sales   i think having a cpa ca whatever is quite beneficial in the finance industry of course it 's not mandatory for the most part and cfa makes a lot more sense but it gives you a better understanding of how numbers ratios are actually created    if anything it will give you a leg up from other people it certainly wo n't hurt to have do you mind me asking which firm you 're with

i would not recommend borrowing your 401(k money to buy a house for two reasons when you borrow money from your 401(k it is no longer invested yes you pay yourself interest but you miss out on the investment gains for the life of the loan   if you leave your job the loan is due in full shortly thereafter if you do not pay it back you are hit with taxes and penalties   if i were you i would roll it over into an ira for the reasons you mentioned

gt businesses are n't a charity they pay for work and exist for profit they are n't supposed to have feelings so austerity and getting the most out of your employees causes the company to become lean and efficient   i agree that 's why i require that my employees sleep at the office so they do n't waste time driving back and forth much more efficient sadly the department of labor disagrees so its a no go until the lawsuit gets resolved goddamn regulation getting in the way of us job creators    gt canadians have been becoming more skeptical of tim hortons since before the buyout from burger king and 3 g did n't significantly change the values and product they cut costs and made it a less cushy environment the ill will toward tim hortons was not caused by 3 g as you suggested   cough

of course i do the surveys are from graduates of the last year or two or three depending on which one you look at nobody is implying that all the people have successful established careers because inherently that 's not what the surveys are about the surveys are about you finding a job when you graduate the career part is up to you not the school they are self reported but nobody has a reason to lie or not report their salaries correctly    what i 'm getting at here is that there is no conspiracy by the school to skew the way information is presented any college applicant with half a brain knows what they are looking at when they see the numbers they are not misrepresented thus there is no lying

you are not perfectly clear but i will assume that your ex girlfriend owns the car and that her name is the only one on the title the fact that you paid off the loan and repaired the car is completely irrelevant from a court 's point of view you gifted the car to your girlfriend if you are listed on the title then your best move is to steal the car and hide it so she ca n't steal it back note that you are not actually stealing it if you are listed on the title since you own the car try to steal it when it is parked in some public place avoid going onto her property wait until she gets hungry then offer her $ 500 if she agrees to remove her name from the title by the way after you steal the car send a certified letter to her informing her that you have possession of the car this is so that she has no grounds to report it stolen check with the police periodically to make sure she does n't report it stolen anyway if she reports it stolen after you have notified her that you have possession then it is a crime making a false report

you should talk to a lawyer one solution i can think of is using a trust keep in mind that that may complicate things non trusts are taxed on income not distributed and trust means you effectively keep the of the stock if you do n't mind paying taxes on the dividends and keep the stocks in a living trust that would be imho the simplest solution that would however invoke the gift estate tax at the value of the stock when the ownership actually passes to the intended i.e. you die gift the stock to the child it would be very hard to pay the gift tax now and avoid getting the ssn and opening an account for the child with it

assuming that partial payments are held without interest until enough money has accumulated to make at least a full payment and assuming that overpayments are applied toward principal a strategy of making three $   payments per month will shorten your amortization period by less than one month   these calculations assume that the interest rate is 12.5 percent apr compounded monthly with an apy of percent instead of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   you would make the equivalent of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   if you make one $   payment every ten days you will make an average of partial payments per year instead of 36 partial payments per year   this will speed up your loan amortization by about another month and a half over the course of the 72 month loan   one month of shortening is due to the extra principal payments and the other half month is due to interest savings    to a second approximation this strategy is similar to paying $   per month for 69 months plus a final payment of $     in other words this strategy will probably involve about payments of $   each possibly with a small payment

and yet the same law that these individuals and companies use to    lower their taxes applies for every citizen and company of the    country thus in principle every individual and company could make    use of these methods clearly they do not why misconception number 1 how did you conclude they do not because ny times did n't spend time doing an expose on your plumber the panama papers and the paradise papers contain the files from merely three companies that help in this large industry this is a story about poor it policies of three companies a potential reason could be the price charged to set up and maintain these services this is a significant deterrent   the costs of forming offshore entities are perpetuated by the expensive lawyers registered agents and incompetent government representatives in these tiny jurisdictions for what its worth even most united states are pretty incompetent at these administrative processes really only a few financial centers and a few exceptions have it all streamlined these are scale problems primarily the incompetence of different nation state 's public sectors will make you realize everything you take for granted the main message emerging from panama papers paradise papers and the like is that it is the rich powerful and famous who make use of and benefit from tax havens but not exclusively for tax purposes newspapers and even the organization leaking this information is driving clicks to a gullible and public i 've talked with who release and push the discussion on the panama paradise papers they really do believe in their tax expose angle but lack any consideration of how business work tax haven these are sovereign nations with due process with democratically elected legislatures who looked at their budget and realized they do n't need to fund their government via passive taxes their governments offer a good and service that people want and it provides enough revenues to their governments many of these jurisdictions have well evolved corporate laws for fast evolving business models   for example the segregated portfolio company in the british virgin islands is more well defined and supported by clearer case law and is more useful entity than a series llc in the few united states that support it there are at least a dozen reasons why someone would use a tax haven where only one of them is tax

edit 2 my whole answer was based on my misunderstanding that you were renting out a totally separate property to your girl friend   i finally understand now that you 're renting out a room in your apartment flat to your gf   so based on my new understanding i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad idea   the answer below is my answer to a different question original answer my answer has nothing to do with business but is totally relationship based    if you care about her in a we might be together a long time way then i would n't do this   i do n't care what arrangements you setup before hand at some point you 're bound to feel like she owes you something at some point   let alone the easiest of situations to imagine she 's late on the rent she loses her job and ca n't pay etc you 'll be forced to make decisions about how much your desire to love and care for her outweighs your need to pay your mortgage   you can argue how your are all day long but is this something you want to bring into your relationship now if you do n't really care to stay with her that long and you could do life with or without her then go for it   i think the big question is is your relationship worth £ 200 edit in the interest of supporting my opinion here are a few articles i found on the subject unfortunately the way renting to friends or family often works out is far from what would be expected between people who care about one another for the most part friends and family members will actually make bad renters because they ’ll expect more from you than a tenant who does n’t know you you may get a lot of requests for maintenance and repairs even for minor things and you may also find that family members and friends think they should be entitled to perks because of your personal relationship with them when they do n’t get special treatment they can get angry with you and that hurts both your professional relationship and your personal relationship american apartment owners association in my experience landlords renting to relatives does n't work out perfectly said a realtor ® associate at williams realty in ca when you do n't know each other there are fewer problems

as others mentioned i am not sure what you mean by stating that your 401 k was rolled over to a money market account assuming that it was rolled over to an ira account you can roll it over to another ira account with a financial institution of your choice either a brokerage or a bank alternatively you can withdraw these funds but since you are under 59.5 years old you would have to cough up 10 penalty to irs for this unqualified withdrawal therefore i would strongly recommend for you to wait till you reach this eligible age other qualified penalty free withdrawals are purchase of the first home college tuition medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals disability and medical expenses exceeding 7.5 of your adjusted gross income i would assume that your 401 k was a traditional 401 k account before tax contributions and not roth 401 k so yo would also have to pay taxes upon withdrawing funds whether you do it now or after you are 59.5

you need an accountant and/or a lawyer who is familiar with the us tax code and the rules in south korea assuming from your tag as the interest will be money generated in the us you could be required to withhold some of the interest and remit it to the irs i believe 30 withholding rate since south korea is a treaty country your friend can complete and sign a form w8-ben and give it to you so you may withhold a lower amount your friend would need to file a return if too much was withheld they may also get taxed in south korea there are probably rules in south korea about minimum interest that must be charged similar to applicable federal rates for the us so check with your accountant or lawyer for this if you craft it correctly you will be able to have a loan as a mortgage with the house properly secured which then would allow you to deduct mortgage interest rates from your return as far as i am aware there is no maximum amount for loans

switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights   recently it is has started to violate those rights by forcing banks to turn over the names of account holders to the us government   not a great trend another aspect that makes switzerland an attractive place for people and businesses is the swiss 's neutral policy   the swiss government is not deploying the swiss military around the globe to fight terrorism to spread democracy to advance its own power or other such murderous government programs   the swiss people do not have to worry about the payback that arrives because of such government programs the swiss were traditionally extreme advocates of individual gun rights which allows the people to provide protection for themselves against others and against the government   this too is changing read section on the enemy within in a not so favorable direction i also the swiss franc was the last major currency to sever its tie to gold   the currency use to be highly desired due to its tie to gold   i think the currency is still highly regarded but the swiss central bank is participating in the currency war and has attempted multiple times in the past couple of years to its currency so it does not appreciate against the euro or dollar

if i understand what you 're asking i think you 're looking at the relationship wrong   yes when one currency has a higher interest rate relative to another it 's value should theoretically appreciate   for example if the usd interest rate is 10 and the eur is 5 the usd should appreciate in value against the eur   however the parity relationship tells you the price at which an investor would be indifferent to the difference in interest rates   so using the formula for interest rate parity   = f s    and plugging in the interest rates from above and a spot rate of $   =   the 1 year forward rate would have to be $ in order for the investor to be indifferent between holding usd or eur   all this assuming interest rate parity holds   i 'm not big on econ but this is how i understood it when studying for the cfa exam the past few months   so please someone correct me if i 'm wrong

as michael pryor answered a bond fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds i 'd also consider an etf based on bonds to be a bond fund but i 'm not sure that all investors would consider these as bond funds not all bond funds are the same just like stock funds you can classify bond funds based on the issuer of the bonds you can also classify funds based on the time to maturity in general bond funds have lower risk and lower expected return than stock funds sometimes bond funds have price movements that are not tightly correlated to the price movements in the equity markets this can make them a decent hedge against declines in your equity investments see pryor 's answer for some info on how you can get tax free treatment for your bond fund investments

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

i am not familiar with this broker but i believe this is what is going on when entering combination orders in this case the purchase of stocks and the writing of a call it does not make sense to set a limit price on the two legs of the order separately in that case it may be possible that one order gets executed but the other not for example instead you can specify the total amount you are willing to pay net debit or receive net credit per item for this particular choice of a buy and write strategy a net credit does not make sense as joetaxpayer has explained hence if you would choose this option the order would never get executed for some combinations of options it does make sense however it is perhaps also good to see where the max gain numbers come from in the first case the gain would be maximal if the stock rises to the strike of the call or higher in that case you would be payed out $ 100 = $ 250 but you have paid $ 100 for the combination hence this leaves a profit of $ 109 disregarding transaction fees in the other case you would have been paid $ for the position hence in that case the total profit would be $ = $ but as said such an order would not be executed by the way note that in your screenshot the bid is at 0 so writing a call would not earn you anything at all

treasury stock is not really represented in the balance sheet as a treasury stock line item in the assets   some companies will break out treasury shares as a line item in the shareholders equity heading of the balance sheet but apple it in the shares issued and outstanding counts under the shareholders equity heading   as of the most recent q2 2017 quarterly report there are shares issued against shares outstanding   this indicates that apple is retaining about shares in treasury on the q1 10-q you can see that apple had shares issued which indicates roughly 49 mm shares were repurchased by the end of q2   you can roughly verify this by looking at page 18 of the q2 filing in the summary of the share repurchase program   repurchased as part of an accelerated share repurchase arrangement between quarters but from february 2017 through may 2017 there have been 17.5 mm shares repurchased   31 mm shares were also repurchased on the open market in q2     the shares issued total is on a downward trend as part of apple 's share repurchase initiative that has been underway for the last couple of years
