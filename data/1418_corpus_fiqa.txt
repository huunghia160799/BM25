i 'm going to go with ridiculous notion   the vast majority of businesses are legitimate run by honest people trying to earn a living for themselves and their employees   these days almost all of them accept credit cards   crooked businesses are a very small minority when a bad business over charges you you dispute the charge and you get your money back   but that 's not all that happens   the bad merchant pays penalties for this and if it happens more than a couple of times the merchant loses their merchant account with their bank which means that they lose their ability to accept credit card payments anymore   a crooked business is not able to rob people via credit card for very long at all a would certainly not be able to include every legitimate business   and a blacklist would never be able to be kept up to date as bad businesses come and go continuously as soon as a business was added to the blacklist they would lose their merchant account and would no longer need to be on the list what you are describing is very rare   my brother once had a bad experience with a tech support company where they were repeatedly charging him for a service they never performed   but a credit card chargeback took care of it   if that company made a habit of that i 'm sure that they got in trouble with their bank instead the most common credit card fraud happens when crooks use your credit card at perfectly legitimate businesses   but your blacklist would n't help you with that at all

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

this sounds like a real consistency issue then when it comes to saying one thing and doing another with regard to spending money it seems common that a company just has n't figured out why that kind of consistency is important   to me it 's a question of roi if a company insists on huge money blowing events what 's the return what is that event supposed to achieve and is it worth it huge money blowing events can certainly be worth it when they actually generate long term sales significantly boost employee morale in turn generating sales hopefully or similar but as you obviously know if all the employees involved in the event feel like it 's bullshit before during and after it goes down then somebody did n't really look at the roi before approving it

the standard double entry approach would just be to create a liability account for the loan and then make a transfer from that account to your asset savings account when the loan proceeds are distributed to you after that point the loan does n't belong to your savings account in any way each account and transaction is tracked separately so you might for instance pay that loan back with a transfer from your checking account even though the initial disbursement arrived into your savings account in order to see how much of a loan you have remaining you need to look at the loan 's liability account to see what transactions occurred in it and what its remaining balance is it sounds like what you 're really trying to accomplish is the idea of   or putting into an envelope certain assets for certain purposes this kind of budgeting is n't really something that gnucash at it does have some budget features but there 's more about being able to see how actual expenses are to expected expenses for a reporting period not about being able to ask how much discretionary assets do i have left before i start hitting my emergency fund the closest you get is splitting up your asset accounts into subaccounts as you suggest in which case you can allocate funds for your specific purposes and make transfers between them as needed that can work well enough depending on your exact goals though it can sometimes make it a little trickier to reconcile with your actual bank statements but there 's not really an accounting reason to associate the emergency fund portion of your assets with the remaining balance of your loan though there 's nothing stopping you from doing so if that 's what you 're trying to do accounting answers questions like how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now if you want to ask how much am i allowed to spend on x right now or am i likely to run out of money soon you may want a budgeting tool rather than an accounting tool

i agree this article does n't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession    instead it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost that is simply not so nothing is that simple   there are n't just jobs and ceo jobs the economy is more complex than that   we lost a lot of high paying jobs in the recession that just wo n't ever come back especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy the fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as i see it   i 'm just happy that we 're adding jobs the inequality thing will always be an issue and i hope it gets better but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth

if you 've got shares in a company that 's filed for u.s. chapter 11 bankruptcy that sucks it really does   i 've been there before and you may lose your entire investment   if there 's still a market for your shares and you can sell them you may want to just accept the loss and get out with what you can however shares of bankrupt companies are often delisted once bankrupt since the company no longer meets minimum exchange listing requirements   if you 're stuck holding shares with no market you could lose everything but that 's not always the case chapter 11 is n't total and final bankruptcy where the company ceases to exist after liquidation of its assets to pay off its debts   rather chapter 11 is a section of the u.s. bankruptcy code that permits a company to attempt to reorganize or renegotiate its debt obligations during chapter 11 reorganization a company can negotiate with its creditors for a better arrangement   they typically need to demonstrate to creditors that without the burden of the heavy debt they could achieve profitability   such reorganization often involves creditors taking complete or majority ownership of the company when it emerges from chapter 11 through a debt for equity swap that 's why you as an investor before the bankruptcy are very likely to get nothing or just pennies on the dollar any equity you may be left holding will be considerably diluted in value   it 's rare that shareholders before a chapter 11 bankruptcy still retain any equity after the company emerges from chapter 11 but it is possible but it varies from bankruptcy to bankruptcy and it can be complex as pointed out investopedia has a great article an overview of corporate bankruptcy   here 's an excerpt if a company you 've got a stake in    files for bankruptcy chances are    you 'll get back pennies to the dollar    different bankruptcy proceedings or    filings generally give some idea as to    whether the average investor will get    back all or a portion of his    investment but even that is    determined on a case by case basis    there is also a order of    creditors and investors of who get    paid back first second and last in    this article we 'll explain what    happens when a public company files    for protection under u.s. bankruptcy    laws and how it affects investors       how it affects investors       when your company goes bankrupt there    is a very good chance you will not get    back the full value of your    investment in fact there is a chance    you wo n't get anything back wikipedia has a good article on chapter 11 bankruptcy at chapter 11 title 11 united states code

i 'm far from certain but i 'll take a swing at it   equilibrium term structure models predict a term structure that we do n't observe and no arbitrage models correct prediction to match reality   an analogous place to look would be implied volatility surfaces   black scholes predicts a specific implied volatility surface or rather it assumes the surface is flat   so i think a hull white style no arbitrage model might work by addressing the difference between predicted and actual surfaces   like term structure models you 'd take a set of observed volatilities and somehow plug them into bs so that the bs price did n't imply arbitrage opportunities within the observed set of options   i 'm not at all certain that i 'm being clear and there 's a distinct possibility that i 'm saying thinking something stupid

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

stock awards by employers are treated and taxed as salary i.e. you pay ordinary rate income tax fica taxes state taxes etc the fact that you got your salary in shares and not cash is irrelevant for tax purposes once you got the shares and paid your taxes on them the treatment is the same as if you got the salary and immediately bought the shares holding period for capital gains tax purposes starts at the time you paid your taxes on the award which is the time at which you get full ownership i.e. vesting time for the restricted stocks when you sell these stocks you treat the sale as any other stock sale you check the holding period for capital gains tax rates and you do not pay or get refund any fica taxes on the sales transaction so bottom line you got $ 10 k salary and you bought $ 10 k worth of company stock and you sold it at $ 8 k half a year later you have $ 10 k wages income and $ 2 k short term capital loss

my feeling is that you 're basically agreeing to throw away a bucket of money for a lesson that does n't have to cost a penny like another commenter said you 're putting the cart before the horse   i once asked a similar question to a seasoned investor though i was n't in the position to toss my hard earned cash into the well yet he told me that the difference between the winners and losers is that the winners do n't need the money i 'm not trying to say that there 's a rich keep getting richer component here while like me get nada   the real nugget of wisdom he offered was that if anyone wants to do well as investors we must invest in a way that we 're not dependent on the money we have in the market instead manage risk carefully so that you do n’t get swept up in the emotional highs and lows   for you what i applaud is that you 're willing to do your research first and part of that should be anticipating how you will handle the anxiety when you put your money in at the wrong time or get out a little later than you should   what i understand now is that you do n’t need to be wealthy to not need the money you just need to invest smartly and leave your emotions out of it

i have done this for years and have been quite successful at it two reason i even need to do this desire to pay for engagement ring and pay for 150 person wedding without using my nest egg savings   you need to keep a document that details when the free aprs run out and you need to setup automatic payments of the minimum balance from your checking account so you ensure you do not miss a payment   you need to understand when you are going to need to make big purchases of homes apartments cars so that you can ensure you are n't doing this right before your credit score is being checked need to leave 12 months without opening new accounts before doing this   i have been able to finance about $ 60,000 worth of unsecured debt paying between 3 5 interest per year we have an unsecured credit line with citibank that charges 14 and is capped at $ 10,000 and discover personal loans charge around 14 as well in pre paid interest   i would say all things considering that this is a great deal if you do n't have a secured line of credit with a low interest rate   it is something however that if you are n't diligent can get away from you from my experience i would rather pay a small amount of interest while allowing my savings and retirement to grow interest hopefully greater than 3 5 than pay the huge expense and start from zero but if you miss a single payment on a 0 apr balance transfer they charge you all back interest concessions plus charge you a penalty rate   like many of the other posts you need discipline to make this work

boiler feed are an important part of any boiler operation they control the amount of water fed to the boiler and the manner in which it is fed   continuous intermittent   in order to properly select a boiler feed pump five key points must be considered   will the pumps operation be continuous or intermittent   this is an operational question and is often answered by the type of level control found on the boiler that the pump will be servicing as a general rule of thumb boilers with a capacity of 10,000 or less utilize a float type switch that starts and stops the boiler feed pump to satisfy a predetermined water level within the boiler this is a classic intermittent operation   boilers with capacities exceeding 10,000 typically employs a feed water regulator and will continuously feed water to the boiler at various rates depending upon the water level in the boiler    by knowing which operation you are to satisfy you can determine which pump design is best suited for your application as a general rule of thumb a pump is used in an on off situation and a pump is used for continuous operation but remember this is a general rule and is some cases a could be used for an on off application and a for continuous    what is the temperature of the water being pumped   it is also important to know the temperature of water you intend to pump most pumps can usually handle of to f other pumps are available that can handle higher temperatures by using external water cooling keep in mind that a pump must be able to handle higher temperatures because they operate a 5 or f.    what is the required capacity   how much water you intend to pump is dependent upon the evaporation rate of the boiler the pump will service a safe figure for an on off application would be 2 times the evaporation rate of the boiler with a level control a factor of 1.3 times the evaporation rate plus is recommended    what is the desired discharge pressure   when you pump directly into the boiler you will need to overcome the pressure in the boiler as well as any piping losses you can chose the right pump by looking at the pump curves to determine which will accomplish this task should you have a valve in the discharge line the minimum you will need to add to the boiler operating pressure will be 20 to 25 lbs make sure that the pump can handle the pressure along with the flow rate needed with an on off level control the pumps should be designed for the relief valve pressure   what is the or net positive head required   this is the last piece of information that you will need this is the minimum absolute pressure at the at which the pump can operate to avoid pump the of the system must be greater than the of the pump in other words the available must be higher than the required we have always sized our stands to be two feet higher than the needed for the pump selection remember the water level in the storage tank adds to the safety margin

overall i think it sounds like it 's worth it it 's hard to find that high of a rate on a checking account these days   it looks like you 're looking at this bank and i can see they have a few more requirements that seem a little tedious if you do n't do these things every month then you lose the great interest rate if you can think of an easy way to jump through these hoops and not forget then it 's probably worth it for example if you routinely eat out for lunch or buy a morning coffee you can use that card to pay for it set yourself a recurring reminder in your calendar or smartphone to remind you to login to the online banking site ultimately since this is an emergency fund it 's a good idea to keep it nice and liquid in a checking account you 're not likely going to find many other options that will give you a better and safe return and still keep your funds available for when you need them in summary it sounds like a good idea to me so long as you think you can reliably jump through their hoops

given your clarifying comment that you 're asking about the length of stay rather than airbnb in particular i 'd say there is a decent chance there will be tax differences   the difference is unlikely to be in income tax but many cities have local ordinances that impose transaction taxes on short stays   for instance the town where i live has a transient occupancy tax for any paid stay of less than 31 days unfortunately because these taxes are often levied by individual cities it 's hard to know whether one applies in your case   one town may impose no tax while the town right next to it does impose a tax   you 'll have to look at what your local laws are   this could be easy if your town has a nice comprehensive website about local laws if not you may have to do some deeper research in any case you should definitely look into it since there could be if there is a tax and the city finds out you 're not paying it   as airbnb has grown in popularity many municipalities have begun to crack down on airbnb renters who try to make money without paying taxes like a regular motel as well as conforming to other laws e.g. running a business in a neighborhood residential

even though this is n't really personal finance related i still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed i do n't know where you got the phrase pass through insurance from   what you 're describing is a self funded plan   in a self funded arrangement an employer contracts a third party administrator tpa usually one of the big health insurance carriers to use it 's provider network process and claims etc   in addition to the tpa there will be some sort of stop loss insurance coverage on each participant   stop loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime   the employer 's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage assuming the stop loss does n't have a maximum almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people   these costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues   a cancer patient can easily cost $ 1,000,000 in a year   someone 's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a surgery will in a year if we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance small group is tightly regulated   usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority there is no negotiating your group 's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums    employers have no way of obtaining any medical claim information on employees mid market is a pooled arrangement   the overall pool has a total increase and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums   employers get very minor claims data things like the few highest claims or number of claims over a certain threshold but no employee specific information large group is a mostly arrangement   generally your group receives it 's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance   in general the carrier is some risk to a stop loss carrier and employer 's get a fair amount of insight in to claims though again not with employee names self funded is obviously self contained   the employer sets up a claims checking account   the tpa has draft authority on the account   the employee 's typically have no idea the plan is self funded their id cards will have the carrier logo and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member   generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop loss activity   this committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process there are some new partially self funded arrangements which is just a really low threshold   and relatively expensive stop loss program that 's becoming somewhat popular in the mid market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend    i think when you start thinking on a micro single employee level you really lose sight of the big picture   why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease chronic problem that costs $ 50,000 per year   and logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person   i understand the logic of the argument but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month   so a mid level hr hiring manager 1 is n't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee 2 wo n't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it 's against the law 3 a company generally wo n't test the water here because $ 50,000 per year is less than 1 of the company 's annual medical expenses 4 $ 50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law suit     really the flaw in your thought process is that $ 50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot   a harsh child birth can run in the $ 250,000 range so these companies never hire women   or never hire men who could add a spouse who 's in child bearing years   or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years   a diagnosis will ratchet up $ 1,000,000 in a year   spend a bit of time in intensive care for $ 25,000 per day and you 're fired   a few thousand bucks on diabetes meds is n't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self funded plan the second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims   they do n't third you do n't hand over medical records on your resume anyway i typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything   i just wanted paint a broad picture i 'm sure things can be nit picked or focused on

i am not sure about your country but i think each country must be having some fixed time frame for reversal of the transaction which must be less than a month please inquire if that time limit has passed or not if it has n't best will be to wait for some more time before informing them   once the reversal time limit has passed no one except government agencies with court orders can withdraw money from your bank account without your written consent even if they have deposited it themselves world would have been a strange place if this restriction was not there   since you want to close the account you can approach your previous boss or executive from hr account department and tell them your intention after that either you can transfer money online to their account or give them a cheque which they can deposit in their account this way things will end faster and you will be freed from this extra account   if above process takes time another solution will be to transfer the money to your another permanent account and give them a cheque from this account here also you can use online transfers or by sending them a cheque through courier   whichever mode you choose to pay the money back make sure you have some documented proof that may be helpful in future

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

well there are a couple reasons that people from various countries use specific currencies   1   government courts will recognize the settlement of contracts if they are paid with their local currency   so even if you wanted to be paid in swiss francs your contracting partner can choose to pay you in usd instead   this artificially inflates the value of the local currency by increasing demand for it   2   you 're only allowed to pay your taxes in the local currency   this also artificially increases the demand for it and it 's the root value of the currency people for bits of green paper because if they do n't have enough of it to pay off the tax man they 'll go to jail

paying in physical cash is almost never a good idea for large purchases unless you like being audited and/or having lots of attention from law enforcement   all purchases over $ 10k in cash need to have special forms filled out for the irs and financial crimes enforcement network so this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory if you do that on the regular you are being investigated   when people say cash for normal purchases they generally mean a wire transfer e.g. buying a house cash = wire transfer between banks   in this case purchasing a company cash is contrasted with purchasing with stock   so instead of getting $ of amzn amazon takes out a loan or pulls their money from cash on on hand and transfers it to the financial institution handling the sale   everyone who owns wfm stock gets paid out in cash as opposed to receiving some number of shares of amzn

most of the money gained through pe is done through financial engineering deal structuring there are funds that are operationally focused which do make changes on the portfolio company level from what i have seen most people who are operationally focused do not achieve that much in the way of results picture it as consulting except that the results of your initiatives are actually important     as for turn there are funds that specialize in that golden gate capital comes to mind these are far more exciting investments but can be very frustrating if you want to look at it in terms of the public markets in pe are essentially levered value investments it is likely that you are n't going to change the business much but are actually just buying an out of favor business and waiting on the industry to bounce back     the argument that pe funds just gut companies and sell with the new higher operating profitability is somewhat flawed there is really only so much cost cutting you can do once you have fired staff or corrected a mistake you wo n't likely have more chances to gain from that original problem what people should be criticizing is that funds often cut capex and reinvestment to increase results at the expense of the future profitability of the company

because a wire transfer requires the individual bank to bank process it is usually more expensive than an automated clearing house which requires minimal involvement by individuals at financial institutions many ach transactions come with only a small fee or even no fee at all since they are run with more efficiency however if you want a better guarantee that your money will arrive on time it might be worth it to pay the wire transfer fee with both cases it is possible for errors to be made however since you often get to review the information before it is sent with a wire transfer the method is a little more secure also because identities are verified with wire transfers that take place between bank accounts there is less chance of fraud wire transfers that take place between financial institutions are generally considered quite secure from

it depends on whether you want a career as a fund analyst or if you want to be an trader a fund manager will have many constraints that a private investor does n’t have as they are managing other people ’s money   if they do invest their own money as well they usually would invest it differently from how they invest the fund 's money many would just get someone else to invest their money for them just as a surgeon would get another surgeon to operate on a family member my suggestion to you is to find a job you like doing and build up your savings whilst you are building up your savings read some books you said you do n’t know much about the financial markets then learn about them get yourself a working knowledge about both fundamental and technical analysis work out which method of analysis if not both suits you best and you would like to know more about as you read you will get a better idea if you prefer to be a long term investor or a short term trader or somewhere in between or a combination of various methods now you will start to get an idea of what type of books and areas of analysis you would like to concentrate on once you have a better idea of what you would like to do and have gained some knowledge then you can develop your investment trading plan and start paper trading once you are happy with you plan and your paper trading you can start trading with a small account balance not more than $ 10,000 and preferably under $ 5,000 no matter how well you did with paper trading you will always do worse with real money at first due to your emotions being in it now so always start off small if you want to become good at something it takes time and a lot of hard work you ca n’t go from knowing nothing to making a million dollars per year without putting in the hard yards first

thirty thousand in credit card debt is a big elephant to eat so to speak   but you do it by taking a bite at a time   one positive is that you do not want to borrow from your 401k.   doing so is a horrible idea the first question you have to ask yourself and understand is how you accumulated 30 k in credit card debt in the first place   most people get there by running up a relatively small amount say 5 k and playing the zero transfer game a few times   then add in a late payment and a negative event or two like the car breaking down or a trip to the emergency room and poof a large amount of credit card debt    obviously i have no idea if this is how you got there and providing some insight might help    also your age approximate income and other debts might also help provide more insight   i assume you are still working and under age 59.5 as you are talking about borrowing from your 401k. where i come from is that my wife then girlfriend found ourselves under stifling debt a few years ago   when we married we became very intentional and focused on ourselves of debt and now sit completely debt free including the house   during our debt payoff time we lived off of less than 25 of our salary   we both took extra jobs when we were able   intensity was our key      if i were you i would not refi the house   there are costs associated with this and why would you put more debt on your home i might cash out the annuity provided that there are no negative tax consequences and depending on how much you can get for it   numbers are the key here   however i feel like doing so will not retire this debt the first thing you need to do is get on a written budget   a game plan for spending and stick to it   if you are married your spouse has to be part of this process   the budget has to be fresh each month and each month you and your wife should meet   to deviate from the budget you will also need to have a meeting   my wife and i still do this despite being debt free and enjoying very healthy incomes secondly it is about cutting expenses   cable off   no eating out or vacations   cut back on cell phone plans only basic clothing   gift giving is of the $ 5 variety and only for those very close to you   forget lattes etc   depending on your income i would cut 401 k contributions to zero or only up to the company match if your household income is above 150k year third it is about earning more   ebay deliver pizzas cut grass overtime whatever    all extra dollars go to credit card balance reduction   at a minimum you should find an extra $ 1000/month however i would shoot for   if you can find 2 k you will be done with this in 13 months   i know the math does n't work out for that but once you get momentum you find more how good will it feel to be out from under this oppression next march   i know you can do this without cashing in the annuity or refinancing   do you believe it

so you work and give a small irregular amount to you parents   you live with very low expenses   assuming you make a bit below the average salary in the uk you should be able to save around £ 1000   if you found a part time job could you save double   i bet you could so why do you need credit   why do you need a credit score having poor or no credit can be by having a large down payment   essentially the bank asks if this person could afford the payment of this loan why have they not been saving the money   you could save the money and either buy the you desire with cash the smartest or put 50 down   putting 50 or more down turns you into a good credit risk despite having no credit history    in case you missed it   why not just save the money and buy it for cash   why have compounding interest working against you   why do you want to work for the bank making the interest payments on loans in order to build a credit score is just silly   it is an instance of a tail the dog

according to regulation t you can make as many day trade round trip stock purchases using a cash account as long as you have the funds to cover each and every round trip sale however the funds generated from the sales can not be used again to purchase new stocks until the settlement period or is over for example say you have $ 10000 dollars in your cash account and no securities you buy 1000 shares of xyz stock in the morning at one dollar per share and you sell the stock 30 minutes later because it went up say by 50 cents according to regulation t you can not use the money generated from the sale of your 1000 shares until after the settlement date however you can use the remaining $ 9000 dollars in your account to execute other trades just as the first trade you can do this as many times as you want as long as you have funds available to pay for the transaction the same day it 's executed the only thing to worry about and that is n't clear is what happens if you perform this action more than 3 times in a week does it mean that your cash account now becomes a margin account subject to margin account rules because you executed more than three round trip trades in a five day rolling period

it all depends on what your financial goals are when you are ready   you sound like you could be ready today if you wanted to be   the steps that i would take are create a monthly draft budget   this does n't have to be something hard and fast just a of what your living expenses would be compared to your after tax salary   make sure there   would be room for fun money a. consider adding a new car fund line item to this budget and deducting that amount from your paycheck starting now so that you can save for the car based on the most realistic estimate that you can make you 'll get a good idea if you want to spend the money it takes to move out alone now or later   you 'll also see the price for various levels of rentals in your area renting a single family home townhouse condo apartment living in a rented room or basement sharing a place with friends etc and know some of the costs of setting up for yourself   since you 're looking at the real estate market you may want to do a cost comparison of renting versus buying   i 've found the new york times interactive graphic on this is excellent   if you are looking to buy make sure to research the hidden costs of buying thoroughly before taking this step to answer your last question if you have the cash you should consider upping your 401 k investment or using roth or regular ira   make sure you are investing enough to get your full employer match if your employer offers one and then get as close as you can to government maximum contribution limits   compound interest is a big deal when you are 23

i 've been taking all the cheap fixed rate debt banks would like to give me lately what rate in practice i find the only way i get a low enough rate on a term fixed rate loan is to use collateral that is auto loans and home loans i have n't seen any personal loans with a low enough fixed rate student loans may be cheap enough if they 're subsidized i guess here 's how i think of the rate if you look at the average annual return on 80 bonds 20 stocks is 6.7 with worst year that 's a nominal return not a real return if you subtract taxes say your marginal rate the rate you pay on your last dollar of income is 28 federal plus 5 state then if you have no tax deferral the 6.7 becomes about a 4.5 average with reasonably wide variation year by year you can mess with this e.g. using tax exempt bonds and tax efficient stock funds etc which would be wise but for deciding whether to take out debt getting too detailed is false precision the 6.7 number is only an average to begin with not a guarantee say you pay 4.5 on a loan and you keep your money in very conservative investments that 's probably at least going to break even if you give it some years it certainly can and sometimes will fail to break even over some time periods but the risk of outright catastrophe is low if your annual loss is 10 that sucks but it should not ruin your life in practice i got a home loan for close to 4.5 which is tax deductible so a lower effective rate and got an auto loan subsidized by the manufacturer for under 3 both are long term fixed rate loans with collateral so i was happy to borrow this money paying about a 3 effective rate in both cases well below my rough threshold of 4.5 i do not however run a credit card balance even though one of my cards is only 7 right now 7 is too high and it 's a floating rate that could rise the personal loans i 've seen have too high rates also thoughts overall i think using debt as a tool requires that you 're already financially stable such that the debt is n't creating a risky situation the debt should be used to increase liquidity and flexibility and perhaps boost investment returns a bit where you 're likely to get into trouble is using debt to increase your purchasing power especially if you use debt to buy things that are n't necessary for me the primary reason to use debt is flexibility and liquidity and the secondary bonus reason is a possible spread between the debt rate and investment returns

the key to understanding where your money is going is to budget   rather than tracking your spending after the fact budgeting lets you decide up front what you want to spend your money on   this can be done with cash envelopes on paper or on excel spreadsheets however in my opinion the best most flexible and easiest way to do this is with budgeting software designed for this purpose as i explained in another answer when it comes to personal budgeting software there are two different approaches those in which you decide what to spend your money on before it is spent and those that simply show you how your money was spent after it is gone   i recommend the first approach   software designed to do this include ynab mvelopes and everydollar my personal favorite is ynab   you 'll find lots of help video tutorials and even online classes with a live teacher on ynab 's website    using one of these packages will help you manage spending whether it is done electronically or with cash   when you pay for something with a credit card you enter your purchase into the software and the software adjusts your budget as if the money is already spent even if you have n't technically paid for the purchase yet as far as strategy goes here is what i recommend   get started on one of these and set up your budget right away   assign a category to every dollar in your account   do n't worry if it is not perfect   if you find later on that you do n't have enough money in one of your categories you can move money from another category if you need to   as you work with it you 'll get better at knowing how much money you need in each category my other recommendation is this do n't wait until the end of the month to download your transactions from the bank and fit everything into categories   instead enter your spending transactions into the software manually every day as you spend   this will do two things first you 'll have the latest up to date picture of where your accounts are in your software without having to guess   second it will help you stay on top of your spending   you 'll be able to see early on if you are overspending in a particular category   ynab has a mobile app that i use quite a bit but if i do n't get a chance to enter a purchase right when i spend it i make sure to keep a receipt and enter the transaction in that evening   it only takes a couple of minutes a day and i always know how i stand financially

in most cases my preference would be to buy however if you intend to sell after just one year i would maybe lean towards renting you have n't included buying and selling cost into your equation nor any property taxes and as john bensin suggests maintenance costs if you were looking to hold the property for at least 5 years 10 years or more then if the numbers stood up i would go with the buy option you can rent it out after you move out and if the rent is higher than your total expenses in holding the property you could rely on some extra passive income

the flaw in your reasoning is that you are assuming that renting a house is easy and automatic who is going to manage the property your parents what are you going to do if the tenants burn the place down start having drug parties there or secretly have 6 cats who piss everywhere so noone will ever want to rent it again what are you going to do when the house goes for a year and you have to pay a year 's worth of mortgage payments with no rental income what are you going to do when some deadbeat decides to stop paying the rent but wo n't move out and when you try to evict him he goes to court to stop you you going to fly to nj to make the court appearances unless you sell your existing house or your parents buy you out then you need to stay you should not attempt to own two houses at once with one of the houses located not where you are at that will not turn out well also just as an aside 30-year mortgages are not an investment they are a way to lose money usually people get them because they want a big beautiful house that they can not afford so they borrow the money that is not investing that is wasting money to live in luxurious circumstances if you want to become wealthy buy a property you can afford not something that you have to string out payments for 30 years

i contend that there is great value in over paying during the year and reaping a bigger refund   i 'm an engineer and understand the concept interest earned blah blah but for most of us this is n't reality the reality is that we spend what we earn plus a little more   at the end of each month if the typical american has money left over we spend it we do n't faithfully put that money that we would have payed into taxes to good use such as savings or paying off that credit card   getting that big refund at the end of the year tends encourage us to make that one time large payment to that high interest account or to purchase that item that we otherwise would n't have saved for or purchased with a credit card   i say give uncle sam the free interest you 'll have wasted that money during the year anyway and enjoy a nice healthy refund that you can put to use for something you enjoy   life is just too short   edit for the nose that ca n't think beyond the possibility of a different perspective post

what this means is this the authors of the website claim they have calculated the cost that it will take to fully fund the medicare medicare prescription drug program social security military and civil servant pensions they claim that the government will have to spend $ 114 t to do the things it is currently promising to do and it has n't set aside the money to do it that 's what is meant by an unfunded mandate firstly i would take with a grain of salt the calculations of any website which claims the us is a in its title you know they are coming to this with an agenda secondly this is money that the government has not actually spent the government does n't owe this money to anyone and it is absolutely untrue that you are responsible along with everyone else to pay this back the worst they can claim is that the government will one day have to spend it assuming that nothing else changes in that time a government could pass a law that reduced medicare or raised taxes and the unfunded mandate would simply go away thirdly the calculation must assume a time period over which the money is spent but the site carefully does n't specify it they can make the amount bigger or smaller as they choose just by changing the time period over which it is calculated to give an example an unfunded mandate is a bit like enrolling in a four year college course without knowing how you are going to pay for it you 've said you are going to spend money on tuition you may even have promised your mother you will finish the course but you can in fact drop out if you choose and you do n't owe anything for courses you have n't taken yet   some unfunded mandates can be legal obligations but this is n't one and in neither case are they money you actually owe that 's not to say that unfunded mandates are not a cause for concern they represent a discrepancy between what a government says it will do and what it can currently afford to do as an illustration of how this works you can look at either russia ten years ago or greece right now all the expenditures in these are being cut people are certainly angry but there is nothing they can do to force the government to make those payments

it will depend on how much you expect to earn this way and whether you expect the company to become profitable soon has the company just not made a profit yet or has it actually made a significant loss that your invoices would just be offsetting if you 're earning over £ 10,000 per year then invoicing through the company is preferable above that level you 'd be taking money from the company as dividends after paying 20 corporation tax with no other tax to pay on your personal tax return as a sole trader you 'd be paying 20 income tax and 9 ni note however that the company can only pay dividends from profits which is a problem if there are significant losses to offset below £ 10,000 there 's little difference through the company you can take a salary of £ per year without paying any income tax or ni with the new £ 2000 discount on employers ni you could then take salary up to £ 10,000 and just pay 12 employee 's ni as a sole trader you pay 9 class 4 ni over £ and a fixed £ 143 per year for class 2 ni paying 9 rather than 12 saves you £ 60 but then you add the £ 143 in practice the company would work out more expensive at this level because you 'll probably want to pay an accountant to deal with the payroll for you having the company repay your £ 2000 from the invoices does n't really save any tax if the company will become profitable in the future you do n't pay any tax now since the money you receive is n't income and the company does n't pay any tax if the extra £ 2000 of revenue does n't put it back in profit however if the company is profitable next year then it will have an extra £ 2000 of profit that would otherwise have been offset against this year 's loss and you do end up paying 20 corporation tax on the £ 2000 you could still have the company repay the loan in order to delay the tax liability but it 's not really tax free money loaning additional money to the company has no tax benefit you just give the company £ 1000 and get your original £ 1000 back later you pay no tax and neither does the company but it was your money in the first place

wow since i commented the down voters came for you   sorry about that     for the record i 've been through the founding and funding of companies a number of times   only once as a cofounder other times as a hired gun   my perspective is that you need to go into vc funding with an understanding of what the vc 's motivations are and where they are in their funding cycle   in practical terms that means that when presented with a 50 chance to get on base or a 2 chance of hitting a home run they 'll take the 2 chance every time   the base hit is only marginally less expensive for them than complete failure   couple that with a few other factors and the set of companies that should take vc money is exceedingly small   the problems come when companies that are marginal take money   that 's when things go to pot   valuations are bad because the company needs the money   the go big or go home syndrome sets in   vcs do etc   in the end money is spent when more being raise which dilutes everybody   then is becomes a with no return for the average employee   one tip   if you every work for a company that takes a round in convertible debt get out as fast as you can   there 's nothing there   what the vcs are doing it trying to keep the company afloat until there 's a low value sale   being convertible debt puts them in a better position for liquidation preference and there 's still a small chance they may find a sucker who will pay top dollar     it 's a reasonable and helpful thing for them to do but it means the rank and file probably including cofounders are getting squat

who issued stock typically support it when the stock price go down   no not many company do that as it is uneconomical for them to do so money used up in buying back equity is a wasteful use of a firm 's capital unless it is doing a buyback to return money to shareholders does the same thing happen with government bonds   not necessarily again here bond trading is very different from equities trading there are conditions specified in the offer document on when an issuer can recall jack up the price of an oversold bond even government bonds have them   the actions of the government has a bigger ripple effect as compared to a firm the government can start buying back bonds to increase it 's price but it will inflation because of the increase in the supply of money in the market which may or may n't be desirable then again people holding the bond would have to incentivized to sell the bond even during the greek fiasco the greek government was n't buying greek bonds as it had no capital to buy printing more euros was n't an option as no assets to back the newly printed money and the ecb would have stopped them from being accepted   and generally buying back is n't useful because they have to return the might run into billions invested in long term projects by the government and can not be liquidated immediately while servicing a bond is cheaper and investing the proceeds from the bond sale is more useful while being invested in long term projects the government can just roll over the bonds with a new issue and refrain from returning the capital till it is in a position to do so

there 's a significant difference between discount and surcharge for starters legal difference if you have a list price of $ x that 's the price you 're committed to sell regardless of the payment method so it does n't matter if i pay with cash or credit i 'll pay $ x. however it costs you more when i pay with credit so you want to pass that cost on me you charge me surcharge an addition to the price in some states in the us and in some other countries that is against the law you can not add on top of the listed price any amount regardless of the payment method however you can say that the list price is $ x which includes the assumed credit card surcharge of $ y. and then you give discount of $ y to anyone not paying with credit card the list price is still $ x regardless of the payment method you do n't have to give the discount the discount is your cost of doing business but that would be legal in some places not all that forbid credit card surcharge so the main difference from legal perspective is that you 're not allowed to add to the list price but you 're allowed to discount from it regarding taxes exemption deduction is not a penalty for negative exemption deduction is an implementation of a social policy for example it is for the public benefit for everyone to own a house so the congress comes up with a deduction of mortgage interest however you 're not penalized if you do n't own a house by paying higher taxes your tax rate does n't change you just do n't get to deduct something that you might be able to deduct had you owned a house with a mortgage this is again a discount of a list price not a surcharge you 're not penalized if you do n't have a house or do n't have a mortgage but if you do you get a break the author you 're quoting claims that bottom line would be the same as if you considered the absence of a deduction as a penalty but that 's not true because even if you do have a mortgage you may not be able to deduct it because your income is too high the mortgage is for too much or your mortgage is not on the primary residence so mere existence of the mortgage does n't directly correlate to the existence of the deduction similarly with credit card surcharges you may get a cash discount but you may get the similar amount of money back even if you use a credit card not as a cash discount but rather as rewards cash backs or points however if there 's no cash discount you wo n't be getting these if you 're paying cash so again you 're not penalized for having a credit card by not getting a discount because you may still get it in a different way and if you do n't you still may end up not getting it so the quote is a rather simplistic and negative view and more of an opinion than stating a fact

i hope things work out and odds are that they will but there 's always a risk profile with any investment particularly an illiquid one like property here you 're taking the risk that the local market in your area does n't tank or that if it does that you can liquidate your houses quickly and retain most of the capital some areas are more stable than others but things can change in decades    my parents live in a decent part of ct house prices were high in the early 2000s then one of the biotech firms around here pulled out one firm was not so big a deal 30000 jobs is quite a bit but the area did n't become rich off one company   but it turns out that was the start of an industry trend 3 more go and suddenly property values crashed luckily we have a pretty small house for the area so most of the assets are n't tied up in it but it 's pretty alarming to see a formerly upper middle class neighborhood become filled with lawns and for sale signs that hang around long enough to gather moss when my parents sell after they retire they might be taking a hit in nominal terms never mind real terms factoring in inflation   this is about investment real estate though i do think there is a more intangible emotional and stability gain you get from owning the land or property you live in

well i answered a very similar question credit card payment date where i showed that for a normal cycle the average charge is n't due for 40 days the range is 35 55 so if you want to feel good about the float just charge everything the day after the cycle closes and nothing else the rest of the month why is this so interesting it 's no trick and no secret   by the way this is n't likely to be of any use when you 're buying gas groceries or normal purchases but i suppose if you have a large purchase say a big tv $ 3000 this will buy you extra time to pay it would be of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this trick is the same person who probably should n't use credit cards at all those who use cards are best served by charging what they can afford to pay at that moment and not base today 's charges on what paychecks will come in by the due date of the credit card bill

money you need in less than 5 years should be saved not invested   the only place i would be comfortable the money would be a money market account or certificate of deposit cd i usually go for the money market account because they pay at or close to cd rates and there are no restrictions on getting to the money however in this case i might choose a cd to keep me from being tempted to borrow some of it for something else but even after typing that i still think i would put it in a money market because if interest rates rise they rise in the money market but not the cd and i just do n't think interest can go much lower

i generally agree with the other answers   regarding the bit about your loan from your parents your arrangement with your parents is certainly material to you getting another   loan   the mortgage application will probably require you to disclose all outstanding debt   obviously if you choose to omit it and your parents do n't tell it probably wo n't come up   but that would be unethical definitely and illegal probably    whether this will interfere with you getting a loan is another question but since it 's your only debt it will probably be ok

your math is correct as you point out because of the property of multiplication roth and traditional iras offer the same terminal wealth if your tax rate is the same when you pull it out as when you put it in   roth does lock in your tax rate as of today as you point out which is why it frequently does not maximize wealth most of us have a higher tax bracket when we are saving than when we are withdrawing from savings there are a few other potential considerations advantages of a roth roth and traditional iras have the same maximum contribution amount   this means the effective amount you can contribute to a roth is higher $ 5,500 after tax instead of before   if this constraint is binding for you and you do n't expect your tax rate to change roth is better roth iras allow you to withdraw your contributed money not the gains at any time without any tax or penalty whatsoever   this can be an advantage to some who would like to use it for something like a down payment instead of keeping it all the way to retirement   in this sense the roth is more flexible as your income becomes high the deductibility of traditional ira contributions goes to zero if you have a 401(k at work you can still contribute but ca n't deduct contributions   at high incomes you also may be disallowed from contributing to a roth but because of the backdoor roth loophole you can make roth contributions at any income level and preserve the full roth tax advantage which type of account is better for any given person is a complex problem with several unknowns like future tax rates   however because tax rates are generally higher when earning money for most people who can contribute to them traditional iras maximize your tax savings and therefore wealth edit note that traditional ira contributions also reduce your agi which is used to compute eligibility for other tax advantages like the child care tax credit and earned income credit   agi is also often used for state income tax calculation in retirement traditional ira distributions may or may not be state taxable depending on your state and circumstances

a checking account almost never earns any significant interest a checking accounts often does not have any limits in terms of how many times you can draw funds from it a checking account often comes with a debit card allowing you to pay online draw cash from an atm machine etc a savings accounts has much higher yields so you should be getting a decent interest unfortunately in the current climate this is not always true especially not with the big banks so you may want to look into a high yield savings account a savings account is often limited in terms of number of transactions meaning you ca n't constantly draw funds from it it must be stable a savings account often does not come with a debit card no a savings account should not be used for regular transactions it 's an account to park your money for a medium long time understand that banks loan out the money in your savings account to third parties so if it would constantly fluctuate they ca n't have this money available to others in return of you parking your money with your bank you should get a nice return interest yes but it 's not common assuming you are from usa passing banking data account number and routing number to third parties is not safe in europe it 's totally safe to share your account number to accept money depends some banks do charge fees some do n't often there are fees when you 're not using the account no transactions or when you do n't have a certain minimum in an account assuming you are american please specify this information clearly in future i would look into an internet bank like ally they do n't have many fees and they have an excellent high yield savings account they also give you a debit card disadvantage is that they do n't have physical branches

i thought the same money as a transferable item is against future items and debt is a transferable item against future money which is also seen as a much farther into the future item   money = item debt = money = + 1 or longer if we agree to pay it off over 20 years   interestingly i have seen a writeup on why gold is the material of choice    if someone can find this it would be great but i will try write from memory google is not helping the story is something like this   essentially when trading a material for jewellery we had difficulty finding what material to use obviously it must be something and tough but not common metals are the obvious choice although crystalline structures like gems and are useful the reason for metals are that they can easily and be shaped into a form that will be aesthetically pleasing and hold its shape    but which specific metal is to be chosen obviously it must be chemically stable so and those metal like elements are removed from contention it must be rare so items like lead iron and copper are too common although not worthless   the most stable malleable and rare materials are platinum silver and gold    platinum requires too high a melting point to be suitable the requirements to and handle it as a material are too high not to deny the value but the common use it prohibitive    silver is easier to handle but tends to continuous upkeep is required and this becomes a of its full value   finally gold rare low melting point resistant to and rare malleable and pretty a sweet spot of all materials

i believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first or when there are other options available such as investment options building up an emergency fund or saving for a large purchase   in that case it 's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present unfortunately when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay e.g. my mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she ca n't deduct auto loan interest despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate it 's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference the formula for that is tax bracket > 1 target loan interest rate mortgage interest rate that said most people do n't think in the long term either by natural or by necessity need to have an emergency fund

stock values are generally reflective of a company 's overall potential and to some extent investor confidence in the prospect of a continued growth of that potential sales over such a short period of time such as a single weekend do not noticeably impact a stock 's valuation   a stock 's value has more to do with whether or not they meet market expectations for sales over a certain period of time generally 1 quarter of a year than it does that they actually had sales or profits on any given day of course catastrophic events major announcements or new product releases do sometimes cause significant changes in a stock 's value   for this reason you will often see stocks have significant volatility in periods around earnings announcements merger rumors or when anything unexpected happens in the world that might benefit or hurt their potential sales and growth but overall a normal average weekend of sales is already built into the price of a stock during normal trading

first if it is in any way a joint account the debt usually goes to the surviving person assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets for example full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate non cash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin if after that the deceased has any assets at all there is usually varies by state a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid this is handled by the estate there is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive then pay as many as possible based on the priority and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty this sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts then disperse remaining assets to next of kin if there are no assets held by just the deceased as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate tell them there is no estate then forget about them a lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate which is not simple or cheap but also note that you can negotiate and sometimes get them to accept less if there are assets when my mother died the doctors treating her zeroed her accounts the hospitals accepted a much reduced total but the credit cards wanted 100

the cost will be around $ if you do it correctly it in florida and can be over a $ 1,000 if you do it in new york new york is more expensive due to a publication requirement that new york has for llc ’s   the price ranges i ’ve given include filing state fees getting a tax id number ein operating agreement membership certificates registered agent fees and publication fees if done in new york each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there yearly paperwork to keep the llc running wo n’t be so expensive expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted   i had a quick look at florida and with someone filing it for you expect around $ 200 to $ 250 a year plus registered agent fees   if you are late in florida the penalty is $ 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees in regards to bookkeeping and taxes yearly tax filing will start at $ 250 to $ 500 for an llc and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work   i recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $ 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an llc   i think $ 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are   i know in some major cities expect $ 75 an hour or higher so the expectation in miami and manhattan will probably be more expensive than and if you doing a little business do n’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping so breakdown $ fl $ 1,000 ny registration of llc + any business license city or other registrations $ 250 yearly fee + yearly registered agent + any business licenses city or other fee $ 500 tax return + bookkeeping fee banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $ 120 a year plus in regards to service i would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up   businesses in the us because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with us clients you are going to have some different needs based on not having a social security number or establishing from overseas

if human beings were i.e. textbook rational and self interested economic minded beings as opposed to simply human then yes simple advice like just stay out of debt and your credit score will take care of itself could work   your simplification would be very persuasive to such a being however people are not perfectly rational   we buy something we should n't have we charge it on a credit card we ca n't afford to pay it off at the end of the month   we lose our job   our furnace breaks down or our roof leaks and we did n't anticipate the replacement cost   some of this is our fault some of it is n't basically shit happens and we get into debt   maybe even knowing all the while we should n't have our credit history and score takes a hit   only then do we find out there are consequences our interest rates go up our insurance companies raise premiums our prospective new employers or landlords run credit checks and either deny us the job or the apartment telling a person who asks for help about their credit history score that they should n't have taken on debt in the first place is like telling the farmer he should have kept the barn door shut so the horse would n't run out   while it is not bad advice it 's not the only kind of advice to offer when somebody finds themselves in such a situation adding advice about actions is more helpful   the person probably already know that they should n't have overspent in the first place and got into debt   yes remind them of the value of being sensible about debt in the first place it 's good reinforcement but add some helpful advice to the mix   e.g. so you 're in debt   you should n't have lived beyond your means   but now that you are in this mess here 's what you can do to improve the situation

here 's an easy test    look at the investments in your portfolio and ask yourself whether if you had the cash value would you buy those same investments today because effectively that is what you are doing when you continue to hold if the answer is no sell and pick something else above all else do n't react to market swings in most cases you are going to get it wrong and wind up losing more by making emotional decisions

it is even when we were bidding major projects we could pretty much guess who was going to get the contract before hand we only put bids in on the ones we might not win because often times the major project would get broken up into several smaller ones because one manufacturer could n't produce fast enough or did n't have   enough stock for the client 's entire job   our major projects guys had difficult jobs one month they would be in the office until midnight the next month they would be playing golf at 2 pm on a wednesday

in addition to the issues discussed in 's answer i think you need to consider your medium term saving needs and existing savings in particular do you have a sufficient rainy day fund a fund you will spend if things go wrong for example if you are dependent on a vehicle that is not covered by a guarantee or service plan you should have enough money saved for a couple of major repairs depending on how secure your job is whether it carries sick leave and long term disability and how easy or difficult it would be to find another job in the event e.g. of your employer going bankrupt due to a downturn in your industry you should have months to years of minimal living expenses in your rainy day fund if you do n't have those things covered you should urgently save as much as you can until they are covered if you do then the next savings priority is to put money by for retirement of course if all goes well the rainy day fund will ultimately get folded into retirement but it needs to exist now in a form you can access quickly

both of the other answers are correct and good answers but i think neither directly answers your question no you do not need to pay additional taxes on the wedding gifts simply because of the fact that they are going into a roth ira   similarly if you put them into a traditional ira that amount would be deductible assuming you met the other criteria including minimums and maximums of earned income in both cases   the act of putting money into a roth ira is not what makes it taxable its original source is   roth simply does not reduce your current taxes any whereas a traditional ira would the seeming exception to this is when rolling money from a tax deductible source to a non tax deductible destination such as transferring money from a traditional ira or 401(k to a roth ira or 401(k   then the taxable event is really the distribution from the traditional ira or 401(k not the deposit into a roth ira or 401(k though of course if you rolled a 401(k over to a traditional ira it would not be taxable

buying or selling a futures contract means that you are entering into a contractual agreement to buy or sell the contracted commodity or financial instrument in the contracted amount the contract size at the price you have bought or sold the contract on the contract expire date maturity date   it is important to understand that futures contracts are tradeable instruments meaning that you are free to sell or buy back your contract at any time before the expiry date for example if you buy 1 lot 1 contract of a gold future on the comex exchange for the contract month of december 2016 then you entering into a contract to buy 100 ounces the contract size of gold at the price at which you buy the contract not the spot price on the day of expiry when the contract comes to maturity   the december 2016 gold futures contract has an expiry date of 28 december   you are free to trade this contract at any time before its expiry by selling it back to another market participant   if you sell the contract at a price higher than you have purchased it then you will realise a profit of 100 times the difference between the price you bought the contract and the price you sold the contract where 100 is the contract size of the gold contract   similarly if you sell the contract at a price lower than the price you have purchased it then you will realise a loss commissions paid will also effect your net profit or loss if you hold your contract until the expiry date and exercise your contract by taking or making delivery then you are obliged to buy or sell 100 ounces of gold at the price at which you bought or sold the contract not the current spot price so long as your contract is open i.e. prior to the expiry date and so long as you own the contract you are required to make a good faith deposit to show that you intend to honour your contractual obligations   this deposit is usually called initial margin   typically the initial margin amount will be about 2 of the total contract value for the gold contract   so if you buy or sell one contract for 100 ounces of gold at say $ an ounce then the total contract value will be $ and your deposit requirement would be about $ 2,500   the initial margin is returned to you when you sell or buy back your futures contract or when you exercise your contract on expiry in addition to initial margin you will be required to maintain a second type of margin called variation margin   the variation margin is the running profit or loss you are showing on your open contract for the sake of simplicity lets look only at the case where you have purchased a futures contract   if the futures price is higher than your contract buy price then you are showing a profit on your current position and this profit the variation margin will be used to offset your initial margin requirement conversely if the futures price has dropped below your contracted buy price then you will be showing a loss on your open position and this loss the variation margin will be added to your initial margin and you will be called to put up more money in order to show good faith that you intend to honour your obligations   note that neither the initial margin nor the variation margin are accounting items   in other words these are not postings that are debited or credited to the ledger in your trading account   so in some sense you do n't have to pay anything upfront but you do need to put up a refundable deposit to show good faith

i would say you are wrong i think you 're underestimating a good warehouse worker there is a skill set involved and many do not have it sadly many people do n't know any better than to arrive high drunk hung over late or not at all on a regular for starters most warehouse workers do n't just lift heavy things anymore in fact probably the majority never lift anything heavy at all they run power equipment big expensive dangerous power equipment that does most of the lifting again not everyone can handle that one power equipment accident can end up costing the company tens of thousands of dollars    aside from that the people performing those jobs are hardly the only employees present someone has to check in the trucks audit the receivers distribute the work of sorting the loading and distribution of product out to the stores maintain the computer systems and a thousand other small tasks on a daily basis i can assure you these positions require a whole lot more skills than the average worker in the 1800s was required   really i find it scary how much you are devaluing these people the fact most well paying warehouses constantly go a few hands short is to the fact good people are not actually a dime a dozen   edit a word   ninja edit   another thing about this is that you seem to want to believe people had a choice in not developing whatever killer skillset it is you think makes you better than them the reality is many very intelligent people can not afford college they do n't have parents willing to give them a dime or a leg up or their parents simply do not have the dime or the leg up to give them even if they wanted to they 're smart but had to work during high school to support a portion of their own expenses and that hurt their grades a bit or they were young idiotic and had little guidance because their parents were constantly away working their off for a to survive on so they off in high school more than they ought resulting in an inability to qualify for scholarships suddenly they 're grown they have to provide housing food and whatever for themselves so they get crap jobs thinking they 'll find a way to that into skills or education when the reality is most employers just want to suck as much out of the employee for the least possible contribution any general manager of a large facility will tell you bragging rights on the golf course are to he who spends the least for the most work done the majority of low skill low pay workers would gladly go back to college if only they could even if they can somehow scrape together the cash required now over $ 8k a year for tuition a crappy dorm and a food ticket at state colleges in my state and books will run you $ 500 a semester for many majors there is the issue of time after working a hopefully full time job they 'd need to find it in them to stay awake during class and to complete assignments on top of that there is the question of timing especially in low skill jobs it is usually required that the employee be available at company pleasure try finding a school in your area which has the classes you need times you can attend good luck with that but wait there are government subsidies yeah good luck with that as well if you 've been working any half decent job and apply and are under 25 and your parents also make half decent wages you will be lucky to be offered loans they are n't even low interest loans anymore also god forbid your parents have a little emergency nest egg saved up from years of hard labor in the salt mines or horrors own a small crappy cookie cutter not aging well home free and clear that 'll cost you big in financial assistance from the goverment

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

the schufa in germany works a bit different from the fico score in the us my background i am a german currently living in the us the information others want to see from the schufa are a bit different if you want to example rent a house or an apartment the landlord often wants to see a schufa statement which only shows that there are no negative entries this statement you can get easily from online and they do n't mention your credit score there if you apply for a real credit or want to lease a car they want to look deeper in your schufa profile however very important is they need signed permission to do this every participating company can submit entries to your profile where the score is calculated from for example mobile phone plans leasing a car applying for a loan some lenders decide on the score itself some on the overall profile and some also take your income into account since there is no hire fire in germany you are often asked to show your last 3 paychecks this in combination with your schufa score is used for determination if you are eligible for a loan or not however they check through every entry which is made there and as long as it is reasonable and fits to your income car for 800 eur month with a 1000 eur salary does not you should not have a problem establishing a good score the in my eyes unfair part about schufa is that they take your zip code and your neighborhood into account when calculating their score also moving often affects the score negatively to finally answer your question credit history is also built by mobile phone plans etc in germany as long as you pay everything on time you should be fine a bad score can definitely hurt you but it is not as important to have a score as it is in the us because the banks also determine your creditworthiness based on your monthly income and your spending behavior

the big problem with your argument is the 10 per year figure because in the long term especially if adjusted for inflation the prices have not been going up nearly that fast here is a site with some nice graphs for prices over the last 40 years and it 's pretty clear to see that pretty much just what you were talking about happened prices outpaced the ability of people to pay which progressively locked out more and more first time buyers and eventually that breaks the cycle pops the bubble and the prices adjust there is always of course the choice to not buy a house and just rent or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble sell and go back to renting   it 's interesting to note that in general rental rates did not increase at nearly the same pace as the prices in the recent bubble which of course made it harder for anyone who bought investment properties in the recent 8 years or so to cover their payments via rental revenue

why does the rising price of a bond pushes it 's yield down the bond price and its yield are linked if one goes up the other must go down this is because the cash flows from the bond are fixed predetermined the market price of the bond fluctuates now what if people are suddenly willing to pay more for the same fixed payments it must mean that the return i.e. the yield will be lower here we see that risk associated with the bonds in question has    skyrocketed and thus bonds returns has skyrocketed too am i right the default risk has increased yes now i assume that bonds price is determined by the market issued by    a state traded at the market is that correct correct as long as you are talking about the market price then who determines bonds yields i mean is n't it fixed or in the    ft quote above they are talking about the yields for the new bonds    issued that particular month the yield is not fixed the cash flows are yield is the internal rate of return see my answer above to your first question

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

it is a general truism but the reasons are that the rules change dramatically when you simply have more capital here are some examples limited to particular kinds of markets under $ 2,000 in capital nobody is going to offer you a margin account and if you do get one it is n't with the best broker on commissions and other capabilities so this means cash only trading enjoy your 3 business day settlement periods this means no shorting a trader to only buy and hold strategies making them more dependent on luck than a more capable trader this means it is more expensive to buy stock since you have to put down 100 of the cash to hold a share whereas someone with more money puts down less capital to hold the exact same number of shares this means no covered options strategies or spreads again limiting the market directions where a trader could earn under $ 25,000 in capital in the stock market the pattern day trader rule applies to retail margin accounts with a balance under $ 25,000 and this limits the kinds of trades you are able to take because of the limit in the number of trades you can take in a given time period forget managing a multi leg option position when the market is n't moving your direction under $ 125,000 in capital worse margin rules you excluded portfolio margin from your post but it is a key part of the answer over $ 1,000,000 in capital participate in private placements regulation d offerings reserved for accredited investors these days as buy and hold investments these generally have more growth potential than publicly traded offerings over $ 5,000,000 in capital you can easily get the compliance and risk manager to turn the other way on margin rules this is not conjecture leverage up to infinity try not to bankrupt yourself and the trading firm

once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the irs cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account the taxes due will be based on your mom 's tax rate as a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf also legally that money currently belongs to her any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such a better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name this way the money is still yours you just do n't have control of it until you turn 18 while probably not an issue here the transferring of money between you and your mom and then back is considered a gift by the irs if the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion based on the clarification that the question is in reference to india while i do n't know the particulars of the law in india my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains the main difference that i would see been india and the us would be the gift tax exclusions unless someone else knows otherwise i would still expect the law in india to see the current account as being the property of the mother

gt;we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910   there a few nuances behind the gold standard but all revolve around indebtedness and currency devaluation    the us actually started off in with a silver standard by the turn of the 18th century there was a fixed ratio of silver and gold to dollars silver was not required to back all of the currency gold was used as well    this bi metallic standard continued until gold and silver were legal tender    the us treasury was on a strict hard money standard doing business in only gold and silver until which the federal government from the banking system it was only after this move the federal government started the devaluation of silver in order to borrow from england silver came in gold came out this also largely the gold rush    then in the us started reducing the weight of silver coins in banks suspended payment in silver   but the basic weakness in a gold standard started with government wanting to manipulate value to unfairly skew debt loan situations    gt;there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency   this is not true us currency did just fine and as governments print so too do prices go up so if there is only 50 billion currency units in and eggs cost 10 cents as they did for previous decades when the federal government prints its way to trillions that s where we end up with eggs costing 2 3 bucks that 's why your grandparents house cost 6,000 and ones today cost 600,000    gt;which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough   no they turned back to gold because of the devaluation of the dollar if the dollar was falling as it is today why would you want to keep your assets in dollars gold can not be printed at whim this is one of the most important factors it forces government to be much more strict with debt if taxpayers were faced with higher taxes or devaluation to pay for the current iraq wars would it have happened no but since the government could print money at whim it served as an invisible tax    gt;and gold possession had to be outlawed    it was outlawed because as the dollar plummeted and gold was eventually made illegal the value of gold doubled and rapidly increased overnight this happened again in 1970 when nixon took us off the gold standard gold was made illegal to prevent hoarders and you make it sound like gold redemption is a bad thing when really its the government being naughty and citizens simply playing the game and by the rules set up by the government    gt;so no we were not on a gold standard   yeah i never said we were but there is a very important   reason we once were so government could nt devalue currency to rack up more debt a huge issue that has now played out to its logical conclusion maximum indebtedness mixed with massive mechanisms for manipulation   when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item    is that why the us did just fine between and 1913 over a hundred years the cost of many items was stable for decades nowadays we have a doubling effect with cars costing 4,000 in 1970 26,000 in 2000 45,000 in 2012 the same with houses food education medical services you name it   gt;there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   wrong again this is because of productivity from technology and invention oil electricity automobiles airplanes and eventually computers infact as i said above fiat currency actually kills productivity    its hard to compare the turn of the century but we can see what happened after nixon took us off the gold standard here      as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard   total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   gt;so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth   since nixon took us off the gold standard in terms of dollar connection in anyway to gold the value of the dollar has plummeted 70 its over 95 if you go back to the early 1900s and currency debasement    there was plenty of economic growth while we were on the gold standard and to say otherwise is simply false

alright guys let 's get some real business discussion going on well at least let 's try   this is surprising citi has not been doing well but i did n't think there was any pressure on to resign either the timing is very weird too right after a successful q3 and with no planned transition plan announced in the q3 earnings   as for pandit 's legacy it 's definitely an unsuccessful one first the whole thing started on the wrong foot with citi buying his hedge fund just to make him the ceo and subsequently closing the fund and writing off $ 200 million the bank 's shares are trading at roughly half book value which shows how much the street did n't trust citi and him

i see another way of looking at this that has n't been addressed yet by offering the discount the company is attempting to change your behavior into doing something irrational that benefits them at your expense the company hopes for one or more of the following psychological effects to happen to you the proper thing to do if you have enough capital to prevent margin calls it to short sell the stock at the same instant the price is set thus locking in the profit eventually you can take possession of the shares and deliver them to offset the short hopefully before you get a margin call from the stock dropping

the debt on credit cards is pretty high its in the range of 30 40 apr there could also be a case very high personal loan for medical or other personal emergencies at a rate in excess of 15 the debt consolidation would offer this at a very low apr there are institutions that offer debt consolidation services that would consolidate all your debt into a single loan at a lower rate of interest they would also negotiate with all your lenders to waive charges and accrued interests to the max extent the benefit to the institution offering this service is that they have a larger loan on books and hence the servicing cost is less most of the time the debt consolidation is offered with some asset as the guarantee for the new loan by doing this the advantages are of course if you are looking for the balance transfer on cards to new one then its same and in fact may at times be more expensive

while you are required to do so as others have said it 's actually in your interest to do so in a recent article at tim discusses the benefits of filing tax returns for teens this situation may or may not apply to you but the message is the same the main benefits are 1 create rrsp contribution room and 2 be eligible for gst hst credits and other possible one shot credits think oil royalty surplus cheques in alberta excerpt you see when lincoln was 14 he filed a tax return and reported $ 2,000 of income that year he paid no tax thanks to the basic personal tax credit but he created $ 360 of rrsp contribution room that year beginning in 2003 lincoln started working part time in his father 's business his father agreed to pay him $ 6,000 each summer to work in the business to help save money for university lincoln did n't pay any tax on the money he earned in those summers because his basic personal tax credit was always higher than his earnings in addition lincoln added to his rrsp contribution room simply by filing a tax return each year

i do n't know what the op means when he says i want to invest in health insurance from now on so that i can use the policy after i retire generally a health insurance policy covers costs incurred during the current calendar year or specific period such as july 1 of one year through june 30 of the next year and does not cover future periods indeed many policies do not guarantee renewal when the current period ends with exceptions for employer provided coverage through cobra in case employment ends so investing in a health insurance policy meaning that you pay the premiums now and the insurance company provides the policy in the distant future is   something that is new to me besides what will the policy include if someone had bought such a policy many years ago say before cat scans and were developed would the policy cover such new developments or the policy would cover only those procedures tests and medications that are available when the policy is written and the insurance premiums start to be paid the long term health of the insurance company is also of some concern   when something is offered to me with a lifetime guarantee i ask my lifetime or the device 's life time or the company 's lifetime

why do people talk about stock that pay high dividends   traditionally people who buy dividend stocks are looking for income from their investments most dividend stock companies pay out dividends every quarter every 90 days if set up properly an investor can receive a dividend check every month every week or as often as they have enough money to the ex dates there is a difference in high $ $ amount of the dividend and the yield   a $ 1/share dividend payout may sound good up front but how much is that stock costing you if the stock cost you $ 100/share then you are getting 1 yield if the stock cost you $ 10/share you are getting 10 yield   there are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow keep in mind why are you investing in the first place growth or cash flow arrange your investing around your major investment goals do n't chase big dollar dividend checks do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely

colloquially there 's no difference except for the level of risk which is an estimate anyway investment is creating wealth through improvement or production   purchasing a house with the intent to renovate and sell it for a profit would be an investment as the house is worth more when you sell than when you bought it speculation on the other hand is when you hope to make a profit through changes in the market itself   purchasing a house letting it sit for 6 months and selling it for a profit would be speculation

i 'm sorry but your math is wrong   you are not equally likely to make as much money by waiting for expiration share prices are moving constantly in both directions   very rarely does any stock go either straight up or straight down   consider a stock with a share price of $ 12 today   perhaps that stock is a bad buy and in 1 month 's time it will be down to $ 10   but the market has n't quite up to this yet and over the next week it rallies up to $ 15 if you bought a european option let 's say an at the money call expiring in 1 month at $ 12 on our start date then you lost   your option expired worthless if you bought an american option you could have exercised it when the share price was at $ 15 and made a nice profit keep in mind we are talking about exactly the same stock with exactly the same history over exactly the same time period   the only difference is the option contract   the american option could have made you money if you exercised it at any time during the rally but not the european option you would have been forced to hold onto it for a month and finally let it expire worthless of course that 's not strictly true since the european option itself can be sold while it is in the money but eventually somebody is going to end up holding the bag nobody can exercise it until expiration the difference between an american and european option is the difference between getting n chances to get it right n being the number of days til expiration and getting just one chance   it should be easy to see why you 're more likely to profit with the former even if you ca n't accurately predict price movement

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

red flag you should not be invested in 1 share you should buy a diversified etf which can have fees of 0.06 per year this has significantly less volatility for the same statistical expectation left tail risk is much lower probability of gigantic losses since losses will tend to cancel out gains in diversified portfolios moreover your view that you believe these will continue is fallacious stocks of developed countries are efficient to the extent that retail investors can not predict price evolution in the future countless academic studies show that individual investors forecast in the incorrect direction on average i would be quite right to objectively classify you as a incorrect if you continued to hold the philosophy that owning 1 stock instead of the entire market is a superior all the evidence favours holding the market   in addition do not invest in active managers academic evidence demonstrates that they perform worse than holding a passive market tracking portfolio after fees and on average and do n't try to select managers that you think can outperform you ca n't do this even the best in the field ca n't do this   direct answer it depends on your investment horizon if you do not need the money until you are 60 then you should invest in very aggressive assets with high expected return and high volatility these assets should mainly be stocks through etfs or mutual funds but could also include us reit or global reit etfs private equity and a handful of other asset classes no gold please or perhaps wealth management products which pool many retail investors funds together and create a diversified portfolio but i 'm that their fees are worth the added diversification if you need the money in 2 3 years time then you should invest in safe assets fixed income and term deposits   why is investment horizon so important if you are holding to 60 years old then it does n't matter if we have a massive financial crisis in 5 years time since the stock market will rebound unless it 's a nuclear bomb in new york or something and by the time you are 60 you will be laughing all the way to the bank gains on risky assets overtake losses in the long run such that over a 20 30 year horizon they will do much better than a deposit account as you approach 45 50 you should slowly reduce your allocation to risky assets and put it in safe haven assets such as fixed income and cash this is because your investment horizon is now shorter so you need a less risky portfolio so you do n't have to keep working until if the market tanks just before retirement very important if you may need the savings to avoid defaulting on your home loan if you lose your job or something then the above does not apply decisions in these context are more vague and ambiguous

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

very rarely would an investor be happy with a 4 yield independent of anything else that might happen in the future for example if in 3 years for some reason or other inflation explodes and 30 year bond yields go up to 15 across the board they would be kicking themselves for having locked it up for 30 years at 4 however if instead of doing that the investor put their money in a 3 year bond at 3 say they would have the opportunity to reinvest in the new rate environment which might offer higher or lower yields this eventually leads fixed income investors to have a bond portfolio in which they manage the average maturity of their bond portfolio to be somewhere between the two extremes of investing it all in super short low yield money market rates vs. super long term bonds as they constantly monitor and manage their maturing investments it inevitably leads them to managing interest rate risk as they decide where to reinvest their incremental coupons by looking at the shape of the yield curve at the time and determining what kind of risk reward tradeoffs they would have to make

first off putting extra cash toward a mortgage early on when most of the payments are going to interest is the best time if you pay an extra $ 1 on your mortgage today   you will save 30 years worth of interest assuming a 30 year mortgage if in 29 years you pay an extra dollar you will only save 1 year worth of interest that said there are lots of things that go into a decision like this do you have other debts how stable is your income what is the interest rate on your mortgage compared to any other debts you may have or potential investments you might make how much risk are you willing to take etc mortgages tend to be very low interest and at least in the u.s. the interest on them is tax deductible making the effective interest rate even lower if you have some other loan you are almost always better to pay the other loan off first if you do n't mind a little risk you are usually better off to invest your money rather than pay off the mortgage suppose your mortgage is 5 the average return on the stock market is something like 7 according to my buddy who works for wells fargo so if you put $ 1000 toward your mortgage you 'd save $ 50 the first year ignoring compounding for simplicity changes the exact numbers but not the basic idea if you put that same $ 1000 in the stock market than if it 's a typical year you 'd make $ 70 you could put $ 50 of that toward paying the interest on your mortgage and you 'd have $ 20 left to go on a wild spending spree the catch is that the interest on a mortgage is fixed while the return on an investment is highly variable in an average year the stock market might return 7 but this year it might return 20 or it might lose 10 or a wide range of other possible numbers well you might have a variable rate mortgage but there are still usually some defined limits on how much it can vary

first thing to note is that contributions i.e. the total of all the amounts that you directly contributed into roth ira at any point in time to a roth ira can be withdrawn at any time without needing any reason without any tax or penalty early withdrawal early because you are under 59.5 of earnings on the other hand will incur tax and penalty i did n't go into withdrawal of conversions as those are a little more complex when you withdraw contributions come out first so as long as you do n't withdraw more than the amount of past contributions you wo n't have any tax or penalty and if it 's not going to have tax it does n't really matter if you do it this year or next year if you need to dip into the earnings however then maybe it would be better to do this year so it will be taxed at lower rates

adp does not know your full tax situation and while the standard exemption system actually designed by the irs not adp works fairly well for most people it is an approximation   this system is designed so most people will end up with a small refund while some people will end up owing small amounts   so while it is possible that adp has messed up the calculations it is unlikely this is the cause   the most likely cause is that approximation ends ups making you pay less tax during the year than you actually owe a few people like your friend may end up owing large amounts due to various circumstances   it is always your responsibility to make sure you pay enough tax throughout the year   while this technically means that you need to do your taxes every quarter during the year to make sure you pay the correct tax during the year for most people this ends up being unnecessary as the approximation works fine   it is possible the exemption system failed your friend but much more commonly people owe penalties because they put the wrong number of exemptions or had other side income on a related note most people in finance would argue that your situation where you owe some money at tax time but not so much that you have to pay a penalty is actually the best way to go   getting a tax refund actually means you paid more tax than you needed to   this is similar to giving an interest free loan to the government

re   in retirement i do n't see how we can    be in a higher tax bracket than we are    now maybe than we will be if one of    us stops working we buy a house we    have a couple of kids etc that 's assuming tax rates remain the same   what if tax rates go up   consider the u.s. deficit and the debt and unfunded entitlement programs even though you may be in a lower bracket in retirement bracket as in ordered income ranges there 's still a possibility that at that later point in time tax rates in general could be higher than today   so even though you may find yourself in a lower bracket in retirement who is to say the tax rate for that bracket wo n't exceed what you pay today in the higher bracket do n't think switch   rather i 'd consider diversifying retirement savings across both pre tax and roth i.e. make contributions to each type of account so you 're not gambling 100 on which bracket you 'll be in what tax rates will be like in the future etc then you 'll at least have some money in a roth account that in retirement you can do with as you please without having a tax consequence assuming the u.s. government does n't get so desperate as to change the tax free nature of roth account withdrawals

with permanent contract in germany you should n't have any problem getting a loan it 's even more important than how much do you earn generally you should ask for a house mortgage with annuity as a type of credit to save on interest besides you usually get a better conditions with a saving bank sparkasse or a popular bank situated in the area where your house is situated you also should n't combine your credit with extra products the simpler is the product the better is for you maybe i 'll write later an extra piece on the common pitfalls in this regard probably you could find a bank that would give you such a loan but it would be very expensive you should save at least 40 because then the bank can refinance your loan cheaply and in return offer you a low interest taxes depend heavily on the place where you buy a house when you buy it you pay a tax between 3.5 and 6 look up here then you pay a property tax it depends on community how much do you pay the leverage is called here 's example notary would cost ca 1.5 of the house price all and all you should calculate with 10 a country independent advice if you want to save on interest in the long run you should take an annuity loan with the shortest maturity pay attention to effective interest rate now to germany specifics do n't forget to ask about extra amortization an option to amortize usually banks offer 5 p.a the interest rate is usually fixed for 8 years however ask about it this period is called it sound ridiculous but in southern lands you usually get better conditions as in berlin or the gap could be as big as 0.5 p.a of effective interest rate in germany they often use so called initial rate of as a parameter

if the ira is costing you $ 100 a year you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider regardless of whether you 're going to withdraw anything   you can transfer the ira to another provider that does n't charge you the fees   or you can convert it to roth and combine it with your existing roth   either way you will keep all the money and save $ 100 per year in the future if you want to take money out of your retirement accounts you should take it out of your roth ira because you can withdraw contributions i.e. up to the amount you contributed from the roth without tax or penalty whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question   if you 're already maxing out your roth ira and you have sufficient retirement savings you could just instead plow that $ 5500 into your student loans   if you can afford it of course it 'd be better to just pay the $ 7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts   there 's no reason to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay loans when you could just divert current income for that purpose instead

because 401k 's are also used by self employed a person who has a schedule c profitable income can open a 401k and match in whatever ratio he wants up to 25 of the net profits or the limits you stated this allows self employed to defer more income taxes to the future why only self employed good question ask your congressman my explanation would be that since they 're self employed they 're in much more danger of not having income especially later in life if their business go south thus they need a bigger cushion than an average w2 employee who can just find another job

keep in mind that you need to have a cash reserve   blindly applying all stray cash to debt reduction is a bad idea   your lenders do not care about your balance   all they care about is your next payment   it is therefore imperative that you have a cash reserve that can carry these payments for several months   having zero cash reserves puts you at high risk for such simple things as the payroll clerk at work missing the monthly deposit rare but it happens i 've also been in situations where a major client had a cash flow issue and delayed payment and our company had to borrow to meet payroll that month   fortunately we were in good standing with the bank and had low debt but it could have been catastrophic for any employees living paycheque to paycheque

evaluate if the rs 5 million term insurance is sufficient typically the term insurance provided by employer is in the range of 1 to 3 times the gross generally one should be covered in the range of 5 to 10 times the gross the sooner you start the lesser the premium and you can get insured for a large amount for a long duration at very nominal rate   note   you can also buy a health insurance for your father note these typically come at high cost generally if over 70 years of age 25 is the premium amount and 25 as co pay so if your dad does n't fall ill once in 3 years its a loss making proposition edit accident insurance best take is along with rider on term plan additional health insurance is a good idea and helps if you are in between jobs plus the new company health insurance can reject a particular treatment as pre existing i.e. certain illness in certain plans require one to have coverage for 3 years before the claim for it can be covered

the duration of a bond tells you the sensitivity of its price to its yield there are various ways of defining it see here for example and it would have been preferable to have a more precise statement of the type of duration we should assume in answering this question however my best guess given that the duration is stated without units is that this is a modified duration this is defined as the percentage decrease in the bond price for a 1 increase in the yield so change in price = x duration as x change in yield in for your duration of 5 this means that the bond price decreases by a relative 5 for every 1 absolute increase in its yield using the actual yield change in your question 0.18 we find change in price = x 5 x 4.87 4.69 = so the new price will be 1015 = £

the details of credit score calculation tend to change periodically but the fundamentals are mostly consistent   pay your bills keep your average account age high overpay your credit card minimums and keep your overall debt low   and do soft pulls on your credit report to see what 's happening first the simplest route pay all your bills early or on time   automatic deduction may be useful in this regard especially for bills with predictable amounts   a corollary to this tip is to never leave an unpaid bill   what often happens to young people is in the course of moving around they leave the final bill unpaid and it gets reported to collections   make sure you follow up online with all bills even after canceling the service second average account age and oldest account age matter   open an account like a credit card and never close it so you 'll have an older account hopefully a zero fee card   try to keep other accounts open rather than closing them no need to cancel a zero fee credit card so your average account age stays higher   a card that works on internal systems like a gift card is not going to show up on a credit report a card that works like any visa mc is likely going to show up   the rule of thumb is if they need your ssn to run a credit check for the application then the card will appear on a credit report   you can pull your credit report to find out if the card is listed you may have to allow time for lag before the card appears but i 'm not sure how long that might be    third a tip for extra credit score is to pay more than the minimum required on credit card bills   you can achieve this by either using your credit card at least once a month or by leaving a small hanging balance each month so there 's always something to overpay next month   credit card reporting will be either unpaid underpaid minimum paid or overpaid   minimum payment helps your score and overpayment helps more   if you can use your credit card every month that will give you something to overpay every month   otherwise you can leave a small debt left on the card but still pay over the monthly minimum   however your total debt load especially debt carried on your cards counts against your score aim for less than 10 of your limit finally of course is to pull your credit report periodically   you need to know what others are seeing   since debt load utilization matters make sure the reported card maximum is correct on your credit report   talk to your bank or account issuer if the limit is wrong   if a collection appears then you need to handle it   often you can negotiate with the collector but be careful to negotiate how they will report the resolution   you want them to agree to remove any negative information either in exchange for payment or because of a mistake   failing that you want them to mark it paid in full or satisfied in full letting them your score that you only partially paid is what you want to avoid since it most signals someone with cash flow problems and credit issues   they control their reporting to credit bureaus so if the person on the phone ask to speak to their supervisor or someone with negotiating authority   try to get any agreements in writing remember that your total debt load is a factor in your credit score   home loans and student loans do affect credit score   if you take on a smaller home loan then it will affect your credit less harshly and leave you with smaller monthly payments

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

the everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite this is misleading it has nothing to do with being either an investor or a market maker it is dependent on the type of order that is submitted when a market trades at the ask this means that a buy market order has interacted with a sell limit order at the limit price when a market trades at the bid this means that a sell market order has interacted with a buy limit order at the limit price an ordinary investor can do exactly the same as a market maker and submit limit orders furthermore they can sit on both sides of the bid and ask exactly as a market maker does in the days before high frequency trading this was quite common an example being whose traders were notorious for stepping in front of the designated market maker 's bid ask on the island ecn an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask this is completely incorrect a transaction occurs when an active marketable order is matched with a passive limit book order if the passive order is a sell limit then the trade has occurred at the ask and if it is a buy limit the trade has occurred at the bid the active orders are not bids and asks the only exception to this would be if the bid and ask have become crossed when a seller steps in he does so with an ask that 's lower than the stock 's current ask almost correct he does so with an order that 's lower than the stock 's current ask if it 's a marketable order it will fill the front best bid and if it 's a limit order his becomes the new ask price a trade does not need to occur at this price for it to become the ask this is wrong market makers are the opposite party to you so the prices are the other way around for them this is wrong there is no distinction between the market maker and yourself or any other member of the public beside the fact that designated market makers on some exchanges are obliged to post both a bid and ask at all times you can open an account with any broker and do exactly the same as a market maker does although with nothing like the speed that a high frequency market making firm can hence likely making you uncompetitive in this arena the prices a market maker sees and the types of orders that they are able to use to realize them are exactly the same as for any other trader

in market cap weighted index there is fairly heavy concentration in the largest stocks the top 10 stocks typically account for about 20 of the s&p 500 index   in equal weight this bias towards large caps is removed the market cap method would be good when large stocks drive the markets however if the markets are getting driven by mid caps and small caps the equal weight wins historically most big companies start out small and grow big fast in a short span of time thus if we were to do market cap one would have purchased smaller number of shares of the said company as its cap weight would have been small and when it becomes big we would have purchased the shares at a higher price however if we were to do equal weight then as the company grows big one would have more share at a cheaper price and would result in better returns there is a nice article on this also gives the of the returns over a period of 10 years where equal weight index has done good it does not mean that it would continue

do n't do debt   after a few years i forget how many the bad history will have rolled off but by then you will probably have no desire to go back into debt again if you do want to build up a credit score then at that point it 's essentially the same as starting from scratch   however from personal experience once you 've lived debt free for a few years you never want to get back on the debt wheel again a credit score is the output of a behavioral model that indicates the chances that a bank will earn money from your business do things that earn the banks money and you will have a high credit score

paying the minimum balance on a loan can be devastating and is highly un recommended it is important you understand your loan and the terms associated with it loans are given for a period of time but if you pay the minimum it does not mean you will pay it all off by the end when paying a loan money is applied to the interest first and any extra amount is then applied to the principle here 's an example if i have a $ 12 loan for 1 year the interest is 100 my minimum payment each month is $ 1 if i pay that minimum only i will be stuck paying $ 12 at the end of the loan why you ask because each month i 'm being charged $ 1 interest and the payment i am making is only going towards that interest however if i paid $ 2 instead now $ 1 goes to the principal the original $ 12 i borrowed this means that next month i will only be charged interest on $ 11 dollars instead of $ 12 you need to know how much is going towards the interest of your loan and how much is going towards the principle you can speak with your bank about this and they will help you understand in many cases they actually provide you with the numbers on your with examples of how long it would take to payoff your loan with minimum only and how long it would take if you added an extra x amount each month i recommend using the snowball method to pay of your debt it 's simple and effective how much you should add to each monthly payment depends on how much you can afford to add here are some calculators you can play around with cnn money bank rate calc edit so with the additional information you provided we can estimate that you have about 2200 free cash flow each 's your cash after you pay all your bills we can put away 500 each month for a rainy day fund just to be loss accidents or anything we ca n't predict so assuming that is all your expenses including the money you spend on entertainment that leaves you with $ 1700 you can add on to your loan payments so you can pay off your third loan in 1 month then add the remaining balance to the 2nd loan with this income it should take you less then a year to pay off all your loans

it is very helpful to understand that free file is not actually by the us internal revenue service irs the irs does indeed offer access to the program through their website but free file is actually a public private partnership program operated and maintained by the free file alliance who is the free file alliance well according to their members list corp. enterprises free tax returns h&r block intuit jackson liberty tax online taxes taxact and why the income restriction well that 's part of the deal the irs struck the program is dedicated to helping 70 percent of american taxpayers prepare and e file their federal tax returns technically the member companies are offering their own software to handle tax preparation and the rule is that 70 of american 's must qualify for at least one product so this adjusted gross income limit changes periodically so that 70 of the population can use it why restrict it at all this was part of the give and take involved in negotiation with the businesses involved if the program was everyone files for free then it is presumed that many reputable businesses that make the program valuable would choose not to continue to participate in other words they want to be able to not give away their services for free to customers who are at least by income definition more than capable of paying them the irs has said it does not want to be in the tax prep software business so they are not offering their own free software to do the job that private companies would otherwise charge for however there are other restrictions to being in the program like the fact that no business in the program can offer refund anticipation loans offer commercial services more than a certain amount of times so they ca n't you to upgrade and so on some businesses were making a killing off these though they are pretty much solely developed to be predatory on people with the lowest incomes and education levels and iq and with cognitive disabilities and basically anyone they could sucker into paying what were effectively absurd rates for short term loans along with inflated filing preparation fees finally free file was partly developed as an initiative to increase the amount of digitally filed taxes and reduce the paper based burdens of accepting and processing turns in other words to cut government costs not to be a government welfare program even if it were one can generally obtain commercial software for $ so the benefit to those above gross income levels is pretty minor yearly costs to file taxes with such software for those payers would be less than 0.001 of their yearly expenses compared to the benefits by households living below the poverty line fighting to cover an extra 5 30 of the population at the potential expense of having the whole program be a failure probably seemed like a more than worthwhile trade off

gt this is probably the single most clueless statement i 've read about business ever actually made me laugh    because you are clueless do you know how many ads i see on the internet every day zero i see zero ads and every person i talk to sees zero ads because i tell them about ad blockers and they tell their friends and so on and so on   i advertise on reddit and i pay for impressions so every 1k impressions i pay a certain amount but they have no way of knowing if those impressions are actually seen or not they can use sophisticated scripts to determine if the ads are blocked but there are sophisticated ad blockers designed to block just those kinds of things this is a war and in the end ad blockers are going to win this war so why would anyone pay for advertising   advertising is dead it 's dying and if marketers ca n't find a new way to make money they will die with it

yes an investment can be made in a company before ipo the valuation process is similar as that done for arriving at ipo or for a normal listed company the difference may be the premium perceived for the idea in question this would differ from one investor to other for example whether facebook will be able to grow at the rate and generate enough revenues and win against competition is all a mathematical model based on projections there are quite a few times the projection would go wrong and quite a few times it would go correct an individual investor can not generally borrow from banks to invest into a company listed or otherwise or for any other purpose if he does not have any collateral that can be kept as security by the bank an individual can get a loan only if he has sufficient collateral the exceptions being small personal loans depending on one 's credit history the private equity placement arm of banks or firms in the business of private equity invest in start up and most of the time make an educated guess based on their experience more than half of their investments into start ups end up as wiped out an occasional one or two companies are ones that they make a windfall gain on

three companies may have copies of it the bank the title company aka settlement company and perhaps the real estate agent the bank assuming you had a mortgage is usually the easiest one to contact as you 're probably still making payments to them they may have sent you the form in a large packet when you sold the house and paid off the old mortgage there is a tradition of sending customers their entire mortgage file once they pay off the mortgage after 30 years which is very rare nowadays but many banks still adhere to it because the mortgage business is built on momentum and very slow to change otherwise the title company should have a copy of it if you do n't know which company was used they should be named as trustee on the deed of trust which in most states is the official name of the document that we call a mortgage the county recorder 's office will have a copy of that deed of trust on record if you ca n't find it anywhere some counties have these so you could find it online but some would require you to request a copy and pay a small printing fee for it

in the sole interest of improving your credit score the thing you should focus on is lowering your overall utilization the best thing you could do for this would be to get a loan to your credit card debts into a single long term loan the impact of this is that your credit card utilization assuming the loan covers 100 of your balances will suddenly drop to 0 as you 'll no longer have a balance on the cards additionally at this point with a consolidation loan you 'll be building loan history by making steady fixed payments on the loan   the loan will also ideally have a significantly lower interest rate than the cards and thus will save you money that you 'd otherwise be spending on interest   a lot of others here will feed you some irrelevant advice pay off x credit card first ideally you need to eliminate this debt but to directly address the question of how you could improve your credit score based on your utilization i believe the best option would be for you to your credit card debt into a single loan to reduce your utilization on the cards

because this is money se and you 're connecting it to offspring i 'd think about a discussion with them to get their agreements from my perspective anything my wife and i have will go to offspring in the end as such everything borrowed and not repaid simply reduces the estate by that much among multiple offspring such reductions should be against the borrower rather than spreading it out that should be accounted for in whatever will is created this would be the discussion point it might also be discussed how or even if any interest should accrue for unpaid amounts if for example a 1 apr is agreed upon for unpaid loans then the final amount is taken off of the borrower 's inheritance existing outstanding loans might or might not be useful examples for sample calculations if desired or needed if nothing else they might serve as reminders that loans were not forgotten by having such a discussion you can show that you are trying to plan for a fair distribution of your estate perhaps thereby any concern about charging interest to offspring for repaid loans at the same time you 're handing over some financial responsibility giving them a power of personal choice which seems to be a part of what you 're concerned about once such a discussion is started it 's possible that any question of interest will resolve itself naturally the discussion almost necessarily must include all offspring at once one will find it harder to negotiate from a standpoint of pure self interest without objection from another think beforehand about what will be said and about what responses might come think things through as much as you can

there is no right and wrong answer to this question what you and your business partner perceive as fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture   first regarding the two issues you have raised capital contributions the fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity in my opinion what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company the securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable for example you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20 50 or 200   annual interest   salary it is common that co founders of start ups forgo their wages at the start of the company i do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid i suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution also consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner whose idea was it talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept in general execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good full time vs. part time a person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a part time helper control it is important to talk about control and decision making of the company you can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership you can also check the following article about this topic at

cash has zero value until it is transformed into something material    cash hoarders realize no improvement in their lifestyle by gaining more cash than they need    if corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market why would further tax breaks improve anything    an inflated stock market only improves income for very few    people who need money will spend it and put it back into circulation    people will not hoard cash if they know more will show up regardless of their ability to perform    less financial pressure and less resentment of the rich for their preferential treatment would create a more positive attitude among the population and improve productivity    a happier work force is a more productive work force    people should only work part time anyway so they can have a life outside of work to enjoy their lives while they have the health to do it    your life away until you ca n't do the things you always wanted to do does not improve a person 's outlook    life according to me    was a reduction in unemployment compensation medicare and snap payments included in the study    there may be a reduction in spending on crime and addiction as well

there is actually a restriction on how high a wage they can pay you there did n't use to be but now it has to be reasonable for the work you are doing so they ca n't pay you $ 100/hr while other people doing the same work get minimum wage you might ask why on earth a parent would want to pay a child way more than they 're worth the salary is tax deductible to the company then the child pays their expenses hockey fees and equipment field trips birthday presents for their friends and so on out of the money the company paid them   they also save for their post secondary education the rest of the family budget now has a little more room and the parents can lower their own salaries if they have expensive children this means more net money in the company and less total income tax paid by the family for the same total income my concern is that if your parents do n't know whether or not you must be paid minimum wage you must there 's no family exemption then they also do n't know whether you should have ei deducted probably not and various other special cases like eligibility for summer student subsidies the firm 's accountant should be able to help with these things and the company should know all this it 's not the role of a 14 year old to ask the internet how to run a business the business owners should know it

so i 've read the article in question basically it 's over   here 's my opinion i respect charlie munger but i think his parable misses the mark   if he 's trying to convince the average person or at least the average slate reading person that america is overspending and headed for trouble the parable could have been told better   i was n't sure how to follow some of the analogies he was making and did n't experience the clear i was hoping for nevertheless i agree with his point of view which i see as   in the long run the united states is going to have serious difficulty in supporting its debt habit energy consumption habit and its currency in terms of an investment strategy to protect oneself here are some thoughts   these do n't constitute a complete strategy but are some points to consider as part of an overall strategy if the u.s. is going to continue debt fast it would stand to reason it will become a worse credit risk requiring it to pay higher interest rates on its debt   long term treasury bonds would decline as rates increase and so would n't be a great place to be invested today in order to pay the mounting debt and debt servicing costs the u.s. will continue to run the printing presses to inflate itself out of debt   this increase in the money supply will put downward pressure on the u.s. dollar relative to the currencies of better run economies   u.s. cash and short term treasuries might not be a great place to be invested today   hedge with inflation indexed bonds e.g. tips or the bonds of stronger major economies but diversify do n't just pick one if you agree that energy prices are headed higher especially relative to u.s. dollars then a good sector to invest a portion of one 's portfolio would be world energy producing companies   send some of your money over to canada we have lots of oil and we 're right next door anybody who has already been practicing broad global diversification is already reasonably protected   clearly diversification across just u.s. stocks and bonds is not enough finally i do n't underestimate the ability of the u.s. to get out of this   u.s. history has impressed upon me as a canadian two things in particular it is highly capable of both innovating and of overcoming challenges   i 'm keeping a small part of my portfolio invested in strong u.s. companies that are proven innovators not of the financial innovation variety and with global reach

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

since you are not paying the full balance off each month you are carrying a balance from month to month that balance is being charged some interest rate x. with a balance transfer the new credit card pays off that balance as a result you now have a balance of the same amount plus any processing charges on the new credit card hence the balance has transferred from the old to the new and you now pay the new credit card ideally you do this because the new credit card is offering a reduced interest rate saving you money though be warned often that transfer rate is a limited time deal and any left over after the window expires will be charged the higher rate

did a great job highlighting the primary pros and cons of hsas so i wo n't go into detail there however i did want to point out another pro hsas are or can be easy to manage you said is this a better way to approach health care costs instead of itemizing health care expenses on yearly federal taxes i 'm not sure which company you are looking at establishing your hsa with but with mine i have a debit card that i use when paying for medical care and then at the end of the year i get a 1099-sa that provides the amount of money spent on qualified purchases that calendar year yes there are a few extra boxes i need to fill in for my 1040 come tax time but i do n't need to itemize my healthcare costs over the year it really is pretty simple and straightforward also one con that is worth noting is that you become much more sensitive to healthcare costs due to the high deductible healthcare plan an hsa requires for example in all the years we 've had an hsa we 've not yet met our deductible which means we pay out of pocket for any non routine doctor visits the health insurer pays 100 of routine visits like my wife 's annual well baby check ups for the little one and so on so when you 're feeling really sick and think a doctor 's visit would be warranted you have to make a decision after being faced with this decision a time or two you will start to envy those who have just a $ 20 copay of course that 's just an emotional con each year i run the numbers on how much we spent per year on out of pocket plus premiums and compare it to what it would cost in premiums for an type plan and the hsa plan always comes ahead in part because we are a pretty healthy family and i work for myself so do not get to enjoy group discount rates but i thought it worth mentioning because there are certainly times when i know i need to see a doctor or specialist and i cringe because i know i am going to be slapped with a big bill in the not too distant future

the best answer i can give is be prepared for change there 's no perfect question you can ask or assurance you can get prior to accepting the offer that will give you any particularly perfect security or sense of stability here   the company itself is going through a change of identity that can change how it will do business and even what the business is and how revenue is acquired   in the time of the acquisition your role within the company could change radically for better or worse it could even be eliminated entirely if that type of uncertainty does n't appeal to you do n't take the position if you are absolutely about this job the best thing you can do is to learn more about the business itself and see if you can make any educated bets about how your role will play into the changes in business strategy that will come with the acquisition

for an inherited ira there are a few options for taking distributions you clearly have n't done option 1 it sounds like you have n't done option 2 because otherwise you would probably know how it is taxed that leaves you with option 3   with option 3 you must distribute the entire amount within 5 years   for you i 'm not sure if that means you need to distribute the entire amount by the end of 2016 or 2017   if it was 2016 then you 'll probably have to pay penalties distributions from an inherited ira are taxed as ordinary income regardless of your age or the distribution option you select

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

if your business is operating on an accrual basis the income would be counted as occurring in 2016   if your business is operating on a cash basis the income would be counted as occurring in 2017   if you do n't know what that means you are probably using a cash basis for your business which means income and expenses take place when you actually receive or incur them according to cash based principles if you receive the check in 2017 that is when you report the income   for more information see accounting methods in publication 538 in summary you can choose both as an individual and as a business which accounting method you want to use and it is not trivial to change it cash basis on a calendar year is more or less the default and is recommended unless you have a specific reason for doing something else

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

if you look at a trade grid you can see how this happens if there are enough bids to cover all shares currently on the sell side at a certain price those shares will be bought and increased price quotes will be shown for the bids and ask if there are enough bids to cover this price those will get bought and higher prices will be shown and this process will repeat until the sell side has more power than the buy side it seems like this process is going on all day long with momentum either on the upside or downside but i think that much of this bidding and selling is automatic and is being done by large trading firms and high tech computers i also feel that many of these bids and asks are already programmed to appear once there is a price change so once one price gets bought computers will put in higher bids to take over asks it 's like a virtual war between trading firms and their computers when more money is on the buy side the stock will go up and vice versa i sort of feel like this high frequency trading is detrimental to the markets and does n't really give everyone a fair shot retail investors do not have the resources and knowledge in order to do this sort of high frequency trading it also seems to go against certain free market principles in my opinion

the product itself is a derivative as it derives its value from another stock or commodity   it 's similar to a us option which offers in the case of a call the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date but unlike the us option instead of buying the stock the contract is only closed out in cash i 've made the analogy to betting so i believe it to be a fair comparison i hope this question is theoretical you should never buy a financial instrument with no clue how it works

like many things there are pros and cons to using credit cards the other folks on here have discussed the pros and length so i 'll just quickly summarize convenience of not having to carry cash delay paying your bills for a month with no penalty build your credit rating for a time when you need a big loan like buying a house or starting a business provide easy access to credit for emergencies or special situations many credit cards provide rewards of various sorts that can effectively reduce the cost of what you buy protection against fraud extended warranty often up to one year damage warranty covering breakage that might be explicitly excluded from normal warranty   but there are also disadvantages one of the advantages of credit cards easy access to credit can also be a disadvantage if you pay with cash then when you run out of cash you are forced to stop buying but when you pay with credit you can fall into the trap of buying things that you ca n't afford you tell yourself that you 'll pay for it when you get that next paycheck but by the time the paycheck arrives you have bought more things that you ca n't afford then you have to start paying interest on your credit card purchases so now you have less money left over to pay off the bills many many people have gotten into a death spiral where they keep piling up credit card debt until they are barely able to pay the interest every month never mind pay off the original bill and yes it 's easy to say credit cards are great as long as you use them responsibly that may well be true but some people have great difficulty being responsible about it if you find that having a credit card in your pocket leads you to just not worry about how much you buy or what it costs because hey you 'll just put it on the credit card then you will likely end up in serious trouble if on the other hand you are just as careful about what you buy whether you are paying cash or using credit and you never put more on the credit card than you can pay off in full when the bill arrives then you should be fine

yes definitely many municipalities and local governments issue bonds to fund various projects schools hospitals infrastructure etc you can buy these bonds and in that way invest in these things in the us these kinds of bonds are tax free i.e. the income they provide is not taxed by the us government may be taxed by your state check local tax laws there are also dedicated mutual funds that that is all they invest in if you do n't want to deal with picking individual bonds as to mom and pop stores that would not be as easy as mom and pop stores are by definition family owned and you can invest in them only if you are personally acquainted with them instead you can invest in small regional local chains that while not being mom and pop still small enough to be considered local but are publicly traded so that you can easily invest in them you 'll have to look for these you can also use social lending platforms like lending club which i reviewed on my blog or others where you can participate in a lending pool to other people you can invest in a credit union by opening an account there credit unions are owned by their account holders

the op invests a large amount of money each year 30 40k and has significant amount already invested some in the united states that face this situation may want to look at using the bonus to fund two years worth of ira or roth ira   during the period between january 1st and tax day they can put money into a ira or roth ira for the previous year and for the current year the two deposits might have to be made separately because the tax year for each deposit must be specified if the individual is married they can also fund their spouses ira or roth ira   if this bonus is this large every year the double deposit can only be done the first time but if the windfall was unexpected getting the previous years deposit done before tax day could be useful   the deposits for the current year could still be spread out over the next 12 months edit having thought about the issue a little more i have realized there are other timing issues that need to be considered

your return from a bond fund corresponds to the return on the underlying bonds minus fees during your holding period so you can buy and sell at any time some funds charge a penalty of 2 or whatever if you sell your fund shares within 30 or 60 days of buying it there are two basic ways to profit from a bond fund 1 you get dividends from the interest paid on the bonds 2 you have a capital gain or loss on the bonds themselves 1 is likely to happen most not all bonds pay interest on time and on a regular basis this component of returns is almost guaranteed 2 there are no guarantees on what the market will pay for bonds at any given time so this component of bonds is not at all guaranteed your total return is the sum of 1 and 2 minus fees since 2 is uncertain your total return is uncertain

it 's not well defined since the term middle wiki has been used in dramatically different ways   however   gt;the modern sociological usage of the term middle class however dates to the uk registrar general 's report in which the statistician identified the middle class as that falling between the upper class and the working class included as belonging to the middle class are professionals managers and senior civil servants the chief defining characteristic of membership in the middle class is possession of significant human capital gt capitalism middle class initially referred to the and however with the and of much of the bourgeois world and the growth of finance capitalism middle class came to refer to the combination of labour aristocracy professionals and white collar workers gt gt;the size of the middle class depends on how it is defined whether by education wealth environment of upbringing social network manners or values etc these are all related though far from dependent the following factors are often in modern usage to a middle whom gt gt     achievement of education gt gt     holding professional qualifications including academics lawyers chartered engineers politicians and doctors regardless of their leisure or wealth gt gt belief in bourgeois values such as high rates of house ownership and jobs which are perceived to be secure gt gt lifestyle in the united kingdom social status has historically been linked less directly to wealth than in the united and has also been judged by pointers such as manners place of education occupation and the class of a person 's family circle of friends and gt gt cultural identification often in the united states the middle class are the most eager participants in pop culture whereas the reverse is true in   the highest income professionals in the united states are iirc which average so that 's probably about as far as the middle class can extend   then there 's the upper wiki   gt;the main distinguishing feature of upper class is its ability to derive enormous incomes from wealth through techniques such as investment and money management rather than engaging in wage labor or salaried successful entrepreneurs ceos politicians investment bankers some lawyers and top flight physicians heirs to fortunes successful venture capitalists stockbrokers as well as most celebrities are considered members of this class by contemporary such as james or dennis there may be prestige differences between different upper class households an a list actor for example might not be accorded as much prestige as a former u.s. yet all members of this class are so influential and wealthy as to be considered members of the upper   the working wiki   gt;as with many terms describing social class working class is defined and used in many different ways when used non academically it typically refers to a section of society dependent on physical labor especially when compensated with an hourly wage its use in academic discourse is contentious especially following the decline of manual labor in societies   and the wiki underclass or poor   gt;the underclass is located by a collection of identifying characteristics such as high levels of out of female headed households crime violence substance abuse and high school dropout rates the underclass these traits to a greater degree than the general population and other classes more specifically   obviously it 's all a set of essentially arbitrary and artificial lines to draw we do n't have a true class system as existed in the middle ages where there were real legal distinctions between members of the the nobility and the peasants or as happened under india 's caste system

this is just a guess but i would imagine that it has to do with risk the deposits in banks are usually as safe as government bonds broad oversimplification as the us government is considered the most trustworthy even in unlikely event of being close to default it would be rescued by fed so it can just print the money so the banks at the same time have very low competition regarding government bonds and the investments they can do have relatively low roi so they can not offer much more competitive rates on the other hand ukrainian bonds have current rating i.e. the goverment is judged to be likely to default as you pointed out there is war going on and in result the government bonds are considered highly speculative therefore to attract foreign investors they need to have high interest rating similarly the cds at the banks can be considered at the risk of being lost so to prevent flight of capital overseas or people keeping usd in cash form at home they need to offer rates that reflect the risk
