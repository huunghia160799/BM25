i currently have the twenties in 6 rolls of 5 i do n't know what roll means to you perhaps it 's another word for grouping   i think of it as money rolled into a circular shape   do not do that   place all the money flat and together   possibly hand them the hundred and twenties separately if you want to emphasize that    an envelope with the amount on it is a good idea   flat not folded not rolled not separated by or rubber bands   a simple pile of money is best   folding the money once to put in your pocket is fine but unfold it to hand it to the teller    the reason for flat money is that it will most easily go through the money counters   rolling makes the money curved and increases the chance of a jam    and i apologize if that was just a turn of phrase   but i can easily envision some poor teller with on being handed rolled money that then needs to be flattened to go through the machine   particularly if the person handing it over grouped it that way in an attempt to be helpful

the range is fine it 's ~ 1 2x your annual income   first and foremost your comment on the 401(k not knowing the fees is a red flag to me the difference between low cost options say sub .25 and the high fees over .75 has a huge impact to your long term savings and on the advice i 'd give regarding maximizing the deposits   at 26 you and your wife have about 20 of your income as savings this is on the low side in my opinion but others suggest a year 's salary by age 35 which implies you 're not too far behind   given your income you are most likely in the 25 federal bracket i 'd like you to research your 401(k expenses and if they are reasonable maximise the deposit if your wife has no 401(k at work she can deposit to an ira pre tax   it 's wise to keep 6 months of expenses as liquid cash or short term cds as an emergency fund in case of such things as a job layoff they say to expect a month of job hunting for each $ 10 k you make so having even a year to find a new job is n't unheard of   one thing to consider is to simply kill the mortgage before suggesting this i 'd ask what your risk tolerance is if you took $ 100 k and put it right into the s&p would you worry every time you heard the market was down today or would you happily leave it there for the next 40 years if you prefer safety or at least less risk paying off the mortgage will free up the monthly payment and let you dollar cost average into the new investments over time you 'll have the experience of seeing your money grow and learn to withstand the volatility   the car loan is a low rate if you prefer to keep the mortgage for now paying the car loan is still a guaranteed 3 vs the near 0 the bank will give you

thanks for the great response   the example with calculus is perfect group a is some students who will never ever get it no matter how much you teach and train them   as you know group b is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them they probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives   group c most will be in the middle struggle and with efforts of the professor if the class is not more than 10 15 students and their own efforts they will eventually understand some will get c some will get b and few will get a.   which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus   gt the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach    true i was an professor while studying for my master 's in the end of the semester students had to evaluate their professors i got the 2nd best results after another part time professor and way above all tenured professors are you surprised by the way i was teaching introductory classes and i was working for the department i was teaching for as a research intern   as for professors who do n't know how to teach this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past i.e. it 's because of past traditions    in the past the role of the professor was not so much to teach in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school attend and dance around every student 's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind   the role of the professor in the past being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required was to plan and sequence what has to be taught in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class no concern is given for students who ca n't keep the pace also the role was to challenge the students test then and answer any question they may have this includes debates over any topic related to the class material   gt i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job   absolutely true or let 's put it this way the best school was is and will be a master and an apprentice which is somewhat still done in germany and is the only way medical students learn because no choice the life of others is in their hands    by the way masters have zero patience for who do n't show a promise masters also have little talent in teaching but masters have long term 1000 patience to show again and again correct again and again demand explain and challenge their   to the point the masters actually do n't do much work and instead just teach in their own special way

lending of shares happens in the background those who have lent them out are not aware that they have been lent out nor when they are returned the borrowers have to pay any dividends to the lenders and in the end the borrowers get their stock back if you read the fine print on the account agreement for a margin account you will see that you have given the brokerage the permission to silently loan your stocks out   since the lending has no financial impact on your portfolio there 's no particular reason to know and no particular protection required   actually brokers typically do n't bother going through the work of finding an actual stock to borrow   as long as lots of their customers have stocks to lend and not that many people have sold short they just assume there is no problem and keep track of how many are long and short without designating which stocks are borrowed from whom when a stock becomes hard to borrow because of liquidity issues or because many people are shorting it the brokerage will actually start locating individual shares to borrow which is a more time consuming and costly procedure   usually this involves the short seller actually talking to the broker on the phone rather than just clicking sell

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

assuming no constraints on how much you can move or how frequently into and out of your offset mortgage account the question becomes one of what rate of return you expect from your long term savings emergency cash fund the rate you are getting from the offset mortgage account is known since it reduces the principal amount owing and thus reduces interest charges the return is the mortgage rate though i would not be surprised if the offset mortgage account contract has bells and reducing the effective rate saying something like 3 pounds reduction of principal for every 5 pounds you put in so as a movie character once said do you feel lucky today   if so move money from your offset mortgage account to savings and earn more   if not move money in the opposite direction a guaranteed 2 return on the offset mortgage account might be better than taking a risk on the of the stock market and even the possibility of loss in your long term savings account

i 'm going to assume that you want to be invested all the time and each trade consists in selling a security and buying another one similar to your example how much commissions you are willing to pay depends on several factors but one way to think about it is as follows you have a position in stock a and you want to switch to stock b because you think it will perform better if you think there 's a good chance > 50 that b will outperform a by more than x% then you can happily pay up to commissions and still make money over a long time horizon if you like formulae one way to express it is where example if you tend to be right 51 of the time hit rate and gain 110 more than you lose on average win loss ratio you can see that your expected profit is 5.1 commissions so you could pay 2.5 commissions on entering and closing the position and still make money*. unfortunately common sense statistics and numerous studies tell us a sad truth on average people have a hit rate of 50 and a win loss ratio of 100 which means that their expected profit per trade is 0 commission based on that crude observation unless you can prove to yourself that you are better than average you should aim at reducing commissions paid to your broker as much as possible through 51 and 110 are not random numbers they correspond to the results of the top 15 professional managers in a research paper using a sample of funds managing $

to answer the heart of your question it would be illegal for any credit bureau or creditor to somehow penalize you just for trying to make sure that what 's being reported about you is accurate   that 's why the fair credit reporting act exists that 's where the rights and mechanisms come from for letting you learn about and request accurate reporting of your credit history every creditor is responsible for reporting its own data to the bureaus using the format provided by those bureaus for doing so a creditor may not provide all of the information that can be reported and it may not report information in as timely a manner as it could or should e.g. payments made may not show up for weeks or even months after they were made etc the bottom line is that the credit bureaus are not of the data they report   they simply report   they do n't draw conclusions they do n't make decisions on what data to report   if a creditor provides data that is within the parameters of what the bureaus ask to be provided then the bureaus report precisely that nothing more nothing less if there is an or mistake on your report it is the fault and responsibility of the creditor and it is therefore up to the creditor to correct it once it has been brought to their attention   federal laws spell out the process that the bureau has to comply with when you file a dispute and there are strict standards requiring the creditor to promptly verify valid information or remove anything which is not correct the credit bureaus are simply automated clearinghouses for the information provided by the creditors who choose to subscribe to each bureau 's system   a creditor can choose which or none of the bureaus they wish to report to which is why some accounts show on one bureau 's report on you but not another 's what i caution is just because a credit bureaus reports on your credit does n't mean they have anything to do with the accuracy or detail of what is being reported   that 's up to the creditors

negative yields on bonds is opposite of getting profit on your investment this is some kind of new practice from world wide financial institute   the interest rate is for ten years so a $ 100,000 bond under    those terms would be discounted to $ give or take no actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation you will get return not even your principle $ 100,000 but principle $ 100,000 minus negative yields times 10 years assume the rates are on simple annual rate   now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where i am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount   this might looks real odd but there is other valid reason for issuing investing on such kind of bond   from investor prospective every asset has its own expense for keeping ownership of it this is also true for money currency depending on its size and other investment possibility and risk factor the same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually half yearly monthly people with lower level of income but steady on flow choose savings where business go for checking one think of millions of ideal money with no secure investment opportunity have to option in real option one to keeping this large amount of money in hand arranging all kind of security which involve extra expense risk and headache where option two is invest on bond issued by government of country owner of that amount will go for second one even with negative yields on bonds where he is paying in return of security and risk free of getting it back on time   on issuing government prospective here government actually want people not to keep money idle investing bonds but find any possible sector to invest which might profitable for both investor + community ultimately country   this is a basic understanding on issue buy selling of negative interest bearing bond on market    hope i could explain it here not to mention english is not my 1st language at all so ignore my typo grammatical error and welcome to fix it   cheers

income from a hobby is tax exempt under dutch law to consider whether it 's hobby a few rules are applied such as how much time do you spend on the activity and is the hourly wage low obviously having a boss is a sure sign of it not being a hobby the typical example is making dolls and selling them on a crafts fair if you travel the country and sell each weekend on a different fair that 's a lot of time if you only sell them on the fair in your home town it 's a hobby   situation 3 is the most difficult if you just happened to luck out it 's still a hobby if you spent significant time to improve the value of your holdings e.g. by trading in game then it might be seen as work in the latter case you simply file it as income from other sources not yet taxed   for the purpose of determining income from a hobby you may deduct actual expenses so in your case they 'd look at the net income of $ which is not unusual for a hobby it would n't be any different if you took up horse riding decided that you did n't like it and sell your horse at a loss

there are some points not covered in the other answers that i feel are important to address in order to be eligible to contribute to an hsa you must be enrolled in a high deductible health insurance plan hdhp   in general i think this is a great idea for most people who are responsible enough to save up for medical expenses but for a small portion it may cost more money to enroll in this type of plan due to high recurring medical costs   you should always weigh the costs of the related insurance plans against the benefit of an hsa note that once you open an account and contribute you can use the funds at any point after that   the eligibility described here is only regarding making new contributions to the account this may no longer be true but when i first started using an hsa several years back i noticed that the fees and costs administered by the providers   were higher than i ’d come to expect from say my ira administrator   at least this was true for the accounts i found perhaps i missed a better option furthermore there was a much smaller selection of investment options available in those hsas than in other brokerage accounts   if you are not maxing out retirement already it ’s worth comparing fees and historical returns versus those accounts rather than assuming that the tax benefits will make the hsa a better deal in my book if it passes these two checks then the hsa is a tremendous deal that is highly under utilized

basically the money you pay in student loan interest is tax deductible which means as far as the irs is concerned you did n't make that money however what that saves you on your taxes is a percentage of a percentage you save the amount of your current marginal rate on the money you paid as interest simple example with made up numbers let 's say you had a student loan outstanding and you were making payments of $ 150 monthly on it total payments to said loan in one tax year would be $ 1800 of that amount let 's for the sake of argument say that half $ 900 was interest you get your with that number on it and reduce your taxable income by that amount you 're currently doing well not outstanding but ok so you 're in the 25 tax bracket that most single middle are in so your reduction in taxable income of $ 900 saves you the 25 that those 900 would have been taxed at which is $ 225 so all told this loan is a net drain on your disposable income of $ of which $ 675 is pure cost of capital you never received a dollar in disbursements to match this amount you 're paying so it 's money lost now in return for previous gains 10 years later you pay off the debt now that $ 1800 is yours to keep and to pay full   taxes on you pay $ 225 more in taxes actually because of amortization the amount of additional taxes has been steadily increasing as the interest portion of the loan payments has reduced but have the remaining $ in your pocket to do something else while there is good debt and bad debt debt is debt whether deductible or not the irs will never credit your tax bill in the amount of interest owed afaik if someone knows of a loan whose interest is a credit instead of a deduction i 'm all ears so the deduction on this loan reduces your cost of capital to an effective apr of 4.5 and because it 's a student loan and not a mortgage you do n't have to itemize so this is in effect a free deduction even with an fha mortgage allowing me to deduct interest property taxes and pmi and the residual medical costs after insurance of having our new baby the $ standard deduction for my wife and i was still the better deal this year but you 're still losing 4.5 per year to interest that 's your break even if the money you could use to pay your debt could earn a better return than 4.5 then invest it but if not pay off the loan right now investments that could make you 4.5 are at the bottom edge of a steep increase in risk and variance so if your expected roi is close i 'd lean toward paying off the debt

re specifically am i right in that everything i put on these is deducted from tax or are there other rules and   am i correctly understanding this as anything above £ 3,600 per year will not be deducted from your tax neither interpretation seems quite right unless what you mean is this the contributions to a pension or to the share save scheme are deducted from your pay before it is taxed that 's how it works for employer run pension schemes in other words you are paying the gross amount you earn into the pension not the amount after tax it 's a tax efficient way to save because compared to other forms of saving the bit about the £ 3,600 you can ignore this assuming you 're earning more than £ 3,600 a year what happens to the pension if you decide to move back to france or another country in some cases you can transfer tax free worst case you 'd pay some tax on the transfer but not more than 25 see here for the current rules re the share scheme if by salary exchange you mean salary sacrifice where your gross pay is officially reduced by that amount e.g. £ 150 a month that 's even more tax efficient because it saves you paying the national insurance contribution too approx 9 of the pay packet conclusion saving into pension and company share save schemes is supremely tax efficient and provided you 're ok with your money being locked away until you 're 57 pension or tied up in company shares it 's understandably many people 's priority to make use of these schemes before considering other forms of saving where you pay into them from your salary after tax now about this i am trying to understand how much i should put into it should i put money into these or should look for another way to save how will this work out if i go back to france or another country nobody here can advise you what to do since individuals goals and circumstances are different and we do n't know enough of the picture that said fwiw i 'll tell you what i might do based solely on what you 've told us in the question first i 'd definitely contribute 6 to the company pension this gets you the full employer match that 's free money plus remember the tax relief = more free money if you 're 27 a total of 12 salary into a pension a year is a decent rate to start saving for retirement actually 14 would be generally advisable and maybe more still it 's generally a case of the more the better especially while young as you have time for growth and you do n't know what later priorities might change financial needs might arise nevertheless you said you might move overseas so in your position i would then

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

here is a less scientific view of why there is a focus on credit utilization it is the easiest to control by doing something the focus on utilization is coming from the people asking the questions regarding how to improve their score some even have an obsession with trying to wring a few more points even though they have no immediate need for a loan   look at the other factors that means that for 70 the best advice is either wait for your history to get longer do n't open a new line or do n't close an old line therefore the only thing they control is to get their utilization score down if they pay off balance that saves them interest if they ask for or are award an increase in credit line that also brings down their utilization number if it is the easiest to improve it will garner a greater focus from consumers therefore it seems that the credit industry focuses on it in reality each consumer has to look at their situation to see which part of their overall score they need to focus on

market orders do not get priority over limit orders   time is the only factor that matters in price time order matching when the order price is the same for example suppose the current best available offer for aapl is $ 100.01 and the best available bid is $ 100.00   now a limit buy for $ 100.01 and a market buy arrive at around the same instant   the matching engine can only receive one order at a time no matter how close together they arrive let 's say that by chance the limit buy arrives first   the engine will check if there 's a matching sell at $ 100.01 and indeed there is and a trade occurs   this all happens in an instant before the matching engine ever sees the market buy   then it moves on to the market buy and processes it accordingly on the other hand let 's say that by chance the market buy arrives first   the engine will match it with the best available sell at $ 100.01 and a trade occurs   this all happens in an instant before the matching engine ever sees the limit buy   then it moves on to the limit buy and processes it accordingly so there 's never a comparison between the two orders or their priorities because they never exist in the system at the same time   the first one to arrive is processed first the second one to arrive is processed second

let 's say there 's a product worth $ 10 in july and the inflation rate in august is 10 will it then cost $ 11 in august yes   that 's basically what inflation means however   the monthly inflation numbers you typically see are generally a year over year inflation rate on that month   meaning august 2017 inflation is 10 that means inflation was 10 since last july 2016 not since july 2017 at the micro consumer level inflation is very very very vague   some sectors of the economy will inflate faster than the general inflation rate others will be slower or even deflate   sometimes a price increase comes with a value increase so it 's not really inflation   and lastly month over month inflation is n't something you will feel   inflation is measured on the whole economy but actual prices move in steps   a pear today might cost $ 1 and a pear in five years might cost $ 1.10   that 's 10 over 5 years or about 2 per year but the actual price change might have been as abrupt as yesterday a pear was $ 1 and now it 's $ 1.10   all of the prices of over all of the country wo n't be the same    inflation is a measure of everything in the economy roughly blended together to come up with a general value for the loss in purchasing power of a currency and is applicable over long periods   a usd inflation rate of 3 does not mean the pear you spent $ 1 on today will necessarily cost $ 1.03 next year

if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the

cute conspiratorial story   a cabal of evil grocery store owners set up a sprawling and risky supply chain overseas so they can pay more for their products for the express purpose of paying their employees market wages for their labor   grocery store workers are not underpaid   if they were they could walk across the street and make more money at a competitor   so if the profit margins are fat on the supplier side somehow competition would come in there either   you ca n't have it both ways   the vast majority of food products sold in grocery stores in north america are grown manufactured and sold right here in north america   there 's no way to explain it away the grocery store market is competitive and profit margins are slim

i know folks who considered retiring to another country their conclusion was that while base cost of living was lower the cost of the things that they enjoy doing not to mention the cost of spending time with friends they did n't want to give up would be sufficiently higher to erase most of the advantages those of us who grew up in or close to cities feel much the same way about moving out to less populated and less expensive parts of our own country   basically when cost of living is high it tends to be because there are more people who want to live there and are competing for resources and driving prices up low cost of living is generally tied to less desired locations for the same reasons if you can find a location that appeals to you and if you can get the resources there which your preferred lifestyle requires this may make sense for a while there were a number of professional writers moving from the us to ireland in part because the irish tax structure heavily favored writers and other creative artists spent several years living in a renovated irish castle i 'm not sure how many have stayed there after the novelty wore off

generally it is advisable to mention what country you 're asking about as tax laws differ to the best of my knowledge however this particular issue is handled consistently in every tax jurisdiction i 'm familiar with you invested x it appreciated and is now worth x + y. in your example x = $ 10,000 and y = $ 40,000 total x + y = $ 50,000 when you withdraw an amount say a in your example a = $ 10,000 it is considered a withdrawal of both the earnings and the original capital in proportion to the total of your account taxable portion of the withdrawal is proportional to the earnings lets mark it t. in your example t = $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ = $ 8,000 i.e. 80 of the withdrawal will be attributed to earnings and would be taxable short term in your case if you 're in the us and 20 to the original capital this will keep the proportion of the remained the same 20 of the remaining amount will be attributed to the original capital accidentally it will be $ 8,000 and the remaining 80 will be attributed to the earnings the withdrawn amount attributed to the capital $ 2,000 and the remaining amount attributed to the capital $ 8,000 will equal exactly to the invested amount

time value of money the simple calculation for this is fv = pv which reads the future value is equal to the present value times 1 plus the interest rate multiplied by itself by the number of periods that will pass a simple way to look at this is that if interest rates were a dollar would be worth where n is the number of years passing   the concept of compound interest can not be separated from the above compounding is accounting for the interest on the interest that has accrued in prior periods if i lend you a dollar at 6 simple interest for 30 years you would pay me back $ 1 + $ or $ 2.80 but 1.06 ^ 30 = so that dollar compounded at 6 annually for 30 years is $ quite a difference   often the time value of money is discussed in light of inflation a dollar today is not the same dollar as 30 years ago or 30 years hence in fact inflation has eroded the value of the dollar by a factor of 3 over the past 30 years an average item costing $ 100 would now cost $ 300 so when one invests at the very least they try to stay ahead of inflation and seek additional return for their risk   one of compounding is the rule of 72 this rule states that if you divide the interest rate into the number 72 the result is the number of years to double so 10 per year will take about 7.2 years to double 8 9 years etc it 's not 100 precise but a good back of napkin calculation   when people talk about the total payments over the thirty year life of a mortgage they often ignore the time value of money that payment even ten years from now has far less value than the same payment today

new deal type solutions living wages and other things with a socialism streak it 's unattractive for people who have been used to the american way but the alternative is an ever expanding non working low wage class many people do not cut it for service and post college or college level jobs many people are best suited for trade work as more jobs become automated and more blue collar work gets pushed overseas and as our economy turns to service high education work more and more people will be left behind either these people are put to work by corporations by lowering their ridiculous standards for once or the government steps in and does it for them by putting them to work in projects or service and for those that ca n't be placed a living wage otherwise they will be poor and desperate having those people around is n't pretty for a society    i 'm not just making this up people have been predicting this situation for a better part of a century even the wall street article is seeing it the rise of consumerism pushed it off a bit but globalization and increasing technology has taken the edge off of it people need to realize that this is a problem and they need to stop being so arrogant and ignorant about the reality of otherwise it will bite them in the ass is the solution perfect nope but i have n't heard a better one that does n't have attached to it or assume people will just do things out of their good nature

i think everything in your case is just simply missing one important rule of how credit works essentially your mil can not get a loan you can you are making her a large loan that she can not get for herself that is all that is the essence of what this deal is it is not without interest she makes a financial contribution toward your son you get the deal in 2 years assuming she does n't default she will etc imagine it this way you are sitting in the dealership with the dealer and your mil she wants a loan to pay for the car the dealership says you are way not credit worthy so your mil says why does n't my son in law take out the loan instead now the dealership says sure that 's fine from the dealer 's standpoint every other part of your arrangement is irrelevant boring even the only magic trick is in who takes the loan out no other difference you 're letting your mil pull a car out of her sleeve like a and in taking the deal you 're believing her   this sentence i am pretty sure that the ex mil will not let me down i 've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid   is everything you 're making a rather large bet that the things that can go wrong in two years including any situation involving your wife 's welfare are rather miniscule and furthermore that the few times she 's paid you back that did not convince banks and dealer she is more creditworthy justifies her good creditworthiness is the interest worth it do you really believe that your mil needs to wring a car out of you before she would consider contributing to her grandson 's well being which is essentially the interest but wait it 's not everything her daughter my ex wife would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son even if your mil is creditworthy the woman you described as follows her daughter though is a loose will be holding and returning the collateral in this deal things she can do include so i 'm arguing two points obviously my opinion on this is clear i hope i did a decent job of explaining where the components of this deal credit interest collateral play out in the eyes of a dealer or bank and get lost in the mechanics of the rules you worked out with your family

the key word you forgot to include from slide 29 is free riding investopedia defines free riding as in the context of a brokerage firm a free rider problem refers to a situation where a client has been allowed to purchase shares without actually paying for them and then subsequently sells the shares ideally for profit the problem with this scenario is that the client if allowed to free ride can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital this is illegal i have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in australia nor have i been able to find any such rules on the asx website or any of by brokers websites so i think this may be an issue in the usa but not australia you should check the rules in any other countries you wish to trade in

as the other answers suggest there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation amount of equity in your current house cashflow primarily amount of time between purchase and sale if you have a fair amount of equity for example $ 50 k mortgage remaining on a house valued at $ 300 k i 'll propose an option that 's similar to bridge financing place an offer on your new house use some of your equity as part of the down payment eg $ 130 k use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale eg $ 30 k the way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage the proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale you 'll be paying two mortgages and you 'll be responsible for two properties not fun but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this when the sale of your new home closes you 'll be breaking the mortgage on that house when you get the proceeds of the sale it would be a good time to use any lump sum prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house   you 'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break however the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing for this reason this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long eg at least 6 months and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable eg 3 months interest you would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer but you would also have to do your own due diligence remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell if you wo n't have any problems selling your current house quickly bridge financing is likely a better deal if you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell you can consider this approach

i do n't have a direct answer for you but here are some other things you might consider to help you decide on a course of action in addition to joe 's note about consulting a cpa   get a couple contractors out to look the place over and give you some quotes on the work needed most will do so for free or a nominal fee   everything about the extent and cost of repairs is complete guess work until you have some firm numbers you might also consider getting an up to date appraisal particularly if you can find someone willing to give you an after improvements estimate as well   the housing market has fluctuated a bunch in the last couple years your current value may have shifted significantly from where you think it is if you have n't done one recently   you will definitely have to pay for this service i would estimate around $ 500 based on one i got in st louis a few months ago    you might also consider reaching out to a local property management company to find out where they think you would fall in the scope of the current rental market and what improvements they would recommend   you will probably want to be onsite to talk to any of the above people about the work they are proposing and your intended goals so figure some travel costs and time into your evaluation as one of your noted concerns was the state of the roof i can tell you that in st louis county and the spec sheet for most shingle manufacturers you are limited to two layers of shingles then the roof is supposed to be stripped and from the bare wood   personally i wo n't even do the second layer i always go to bare wood and start over if for no other reason than it gives me an opportunity to inspect the deck and deal with any minor problem areas before they become big problems i do n't know county to know what the local code may be like but odds are high that the shingle manufacture would not honor any warranty with this installation another potential gotcha that may be out there is your ex may still have a lingering claim to the home if you go to sell it   i do n't know the rules in missouri off hand but where i grew up with family in the real estate and title insurance businesses there was a law regarding homestead rights   if a spouse spent even one night in a property they had an interest in it and an explicit waiver had to be signed to release said interest   review your divorce settlement and/or contact your attorney to confirm your status in this regard also consider the potential of refinancing your mortgage to either reduce the payment or get funds for the improvements repairs    final note i understand wanting to help out a friend i have done similar things more times than i can count but seriously look at the situation and see if you ca n't get the rent or other compensation up to the level of the mortgage at least    you mentioned that you have belongings still on the property what would a storage unit for said items cost in terms of juggling the numbers you could potentially use that value as justification to adjust the friends rent as a fee without any issue   verify with your cpa talk to the friend and see if there are other parts of the job they would be willing and able to take on as consideration for the reduced rent make sure you have at least a simple contract on any such agreement    or if none of the above are sufficient to balance the numbers see if they would be willing to take on an actual room mate to help make up the difference

i do n't have anything definitive but in general positions in a company are not affected materially by what is called a corporate action corp actions can really be anything that affects the details of a stock common examples are a ticker change or exchange change ipo ie a new ticker doing a split or merging with another ticker all of these events do not change the total value of people 's positions if a stock splits you might have more shares but they are worth less per share a merger is quite similar to a split the old company 's stock is converted two the new companies stock at some ratio ie 10 shares become 1 share and then converted to the new symbol shorting a stock that splits is no different you shorted 10 shares but after the split those are now 100 shares when you exit the position you have to deliver back 100 new shares though dollar for dollar they are the same total value i do n't see why a merger would affect your short position the only difference is you are now shorting a different company so when you exit the position you 'll have to deliver shares of the new company back to the brokerage where you borrowed the shares you shorted

gt;if you 're argument held true in court no one could sue anyone successfully   that is my point   admittedly my above example is very simplistic but it was designed to simply illustrate my point   and no buying a shares of google or exxon or whatever other equity would not make you lawsuit proof otherwise all you would need to do is open a brokerage account   i wo n't go into this on post but i would be happy to type out a few real examples they involved trusts holding llc 's and even suing yourself   this whole conversation started by the article about robert kiyosaki getting sued by his partners getting a judgement against him and instead of paying his former partner he bk 's one of his companies to get out of debt   rich dad 's estimated personal net worth   $ 80 sites dad poor dad bankrupt    how many books has he sold   just the rich dad poor dad book has sold over 26 million wiki and obviously that does n't count future sales he has many books dvd 's educational material seminars etc   rich dad is also very diversified and has other business interest such as mining companies oil and gas solar venture capital wiki   the above referenced forbes article goes on to say rich dad co. ceo has informed them that kiyosaki would not be putting any of his personal fortune toward the settlement as for rich global sullivan claimed it only had a few million in its coffers   so here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit it was heard in court and rich dad was ordered to pay $ 24 million to his former   he claims he ca n't pay it and files for corp bk yet his personal net worth is over 3x that amount not to mention the net worth of his new company not to mention future sales   thanks to some financial and legal gymnastics his partners get screwed out of their share of earnings   i fail to see how this is n't an example of abusing the system   rich dad is n't even offering to pay out on future sales or even trying to negotiate a lower settlement   he just pulled out the bk card and fu his debtors will get pennies on the dollar   it seems that our perspectives on ethical business practices are at opposite ends of the spectrum   in my opinion utilization of the bk laws in this manner which effectively makes one completely exempt from liability or financial responsibility is exactly what is wrong with the states at least one reason   if you ca n't or refuse to see this or you truly think this is just good business then i do n't know what else to say other than you are part of the problem     oh and i never addressed your other point gt;first you would be breaking the law for driving without insurance    no problem i 'd pay the + ticket and keep moving while you drink your meals through a straw

the check clears when the receiving bank successfully pulled the money from the issuing account however the receiving bank may hold the money for an additional time before giving it to you sometimes this is done for good reasons to prevent check kiting and sometimes this is about the bank having the money interest free for a bit or just their own processing convenience

you should evaluate where to put your money based on when you need by date is if you need it in the next 5 years i 'd essentially keep it in cash or no risk savings accounts cds money market accounts etc if you need it further than 5 years from now invest for the future with some form of asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance    research asset allocation and decide how to divide amongst different types of investments retirement accounts have earnings requirements and maximum contribution limits

if you look at the definition of time value on wikipedia you may notice this line time value can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside   you are right to think that the time value is increasing as the increases from deeply otm to atm once the crosses the strike price threshold per wiki 's interpretation the upside potential decreases as the underlying price moves away from the strike price think it as if an option is already deep in the money the chance of it getting further itm is slim hence the willingness to pay for that chance aka the upside potential decreases

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

split transactions are to anybody interested in accurately tracking their spending if i go to the big box pharmacy down the road to pick up a prescription and then also grab a loaf of bread and a of milk while there then i 'd want to enter the transaction into my software as i desire entering precise data into the software so that i can rely on the reports it produces often i do n't need an exact amount and estimated category totals would have been fine e.g. to inform budgeting or compare to a prior period however in other cases the expenses i 'm tracking must be tracked accurately because i 'd be using the total to claim an income tax deduction or credit   consider how internet access might be commingled on the same bill with the home 's cable tv service   one is a reasonable business expense and deduction for the work at home web developer whereas the other is a personal non deductible expense were split transaction capability not available the somewhat unattractive alternatives are ignore the category difference and say categorize the entire transaction as the larger or more important category   but this deliberately introduces error in the tracked data rendering it useless for cases where the category totals need to be accurate or split the transaction manually this does n't introduce error into the tracked data but suffers another problem it makes a lot of work first one would need to manually enter two or more top level transactions instead of the single one with sub amounts   perhaps not that much more work than if a split were entered worse is when it comes time to reconcile   now there are two or more transactions in the register but the credit card statement has only one   reconciling would require manually adding up those transactions from the register just to confirm the amount on the statement is correct   major pain i 'd place split transaction capability near the top of the list of must have features for any finance management software

yes you can claim your business deductions if you are not making any income yet but first you should decide what structure you want to have for your business either a company structure or a sole trader or partnership company structure if you choose a company structure which is more expensive to set up you would claim your deductions but no income so you would be making a loss and continue making losses until your income from the business exceed your expenses so these losses will remain inside the company and can be carried forward to future income years when you are making profits to offset these profits refer to ato company tax losses for more information sole trader of partnership structure if you choose to be a sole trader or a partnership and your business makes a loss you must check the non commercial loss rules to see if you can offset the loss against your income from other sources such as wages in order to offset your business losses against your other income your business must   pass one of these tests if you do n't pass any of these tests which being a start up you most likely wo n't you must carry forward your business losses until an income year in which you do pass one of the tests then you can offset it against your other income this is what a legitimate business from someone having a hobby because unless you start making at least $ 20,000 in sales income the easiest test to pass you can not use your business losses against your other income refer to ato non commercial losses for more information

i can answer this question for my jurisdiction florida usa because i lived through it my dad alice passed away in 2008 just as the housing crisis was starting to heat up what happened to the mortgage my dad had a will in place   it was an old will from the 1980 's but never the less a will   we had to provide paperwork to the court that my mom had already passed away and my oldest brother was living out of state he would have been the executor otherwise   with the proper paperwork i became the executor and the property passed in to probate   at this point the estate was responsible for the house and the mortgage on it meaning me as i was the executor we decided to sell the house so we hired a realtor and set an asking price about $ 40k over what was owed on it   as we waited for it to sell i had to make monthly mortgage payments and payments to the hoa otherwise the hoa could put a lien on the property making it more difficult to sell should we find a buyer is it automatically transferred in most jurisdictions i would say not automatic   i definitely had get an estate lawyer and file the proper legal paperwork with the local county courthouse   some states have an easier probate process summary administration in florida that the requirements for small estates is bob expected to pay it off all at once no the mortgage holder was happy for me to make payments out of other estate assets in lieu of my dad   the were earning interest after all   this is probably true in most cases can the house be foreclosed on yes   in our case being 2008 we had a hard time selling the property   the asking price quickly went from $ 40k over what was owed to $ 20k over to $ 10k over then to being equal to the mortgage value   finally i approached the bank about options   they suggested a deed in lieu of foreclosure process   it was easier for us and the bank had to pay less lawyers and such   otherwise a deed in lieu is effectively the same as a foreclosure   at that point we stopped making payments   eventually me and all my siblings the heirs had to sign the proper paperwork giving the house over to the bank in our case the bank did not pursue us or rather the estate for the difference between final auction sale price and the mortgage balance it was an fha loan so the us government wound up picking up the difference   from what i understand this could have happened and we would have wound up with basically nothing out of the estate can the lender force the sale i ca n't give a definite answer on this but it probably depends   if you do n't pay   yes they sure can it 's usually part of the standard mortgage contract   i see 2 other options

started to post this as a comment but i think it 's actually a legitimate answer running a rental property is neither speculation nor investment but a business just as if you were renting cars or tools or anything else that puts it in an entirely different category the property may gain or lose value but you do n't know which or how much until you 're ready to terminate the business so like your own house it really is n't a liquid asset it 's closer to being inventory meanwhile like inventory you need to it on a fairly regular basis by maintaining it finding tenants and so on and how much it returns depends strongly on how much effort you put into it in terms of selecting the right location and product in the first place and in how you market yourself against all the other businesses offering near equivalent product and how you differentiate the product and so on   i think approaching it from that angle deciding whether you really want to be a business owner or keep all your money in more abstract investments then deciding what businesses are interesting to you and running the numbers to see what they 're likely to return as income then making up your mind whether real estate is the winner from that group is likely to produce better decisions among other things it helps you remember to focus on all the costs of the business when doing the math do n't forget that income from the business is taxed at income rates not investment rates and do n't forget that you 're making a bet on the future of that neighborhood as well as the future of that house changes in demographics or housing stock or business climate could all affect what rents you can charge as well as the value of the property and not necessarily in the same direction it may absolutely be the right place to put some of your money it may not explore all the possible outcomes before making the bet and decide whether you 're willing to do the work needed to influence which ones are more likely

from what i understand i never had an resp but would consider one for a future child with the right type of withdrawal you can use the resp money for anything education related basically know that the resp is considered to have three within it 1 your contributions 2 contributions from the government through the canada education savings grant cesg and 3 the return on the investment or accumulated earnings the government contributes an extra 20 on top of your contributions annually by way of the cesg up to a $ 500 max tuition as you noted official tuition fees reported on a fee slip is where one large chunk of the resp will go this will be pulled out of your original contributions and is known as a post secondary education withdrawal different resp administrators bank discount brokerage etc determine what sort of proof of would be required but it ought to be similar between them and different educational institutions this withdrawal is not taxable by either you or the student since the contributions were made with after tax dollars educational assistance payments are for other expenses that the student would incur by being at university in the first 13 weeks of studies you can request up to $ 5000 in withdrawals full time studies $ 2500 for par time after which there is no limit each payment is made up of the cesg and accumulated earnings portions of the resp whose proportions are determined based on the amount this is considered taxable income for the student or beneficiary in the year the withdrawal is made it gets a bit fuzzy here from my understanding the student would ostensibly be able to purchase anything that they could rationalize as education related and i 'm not sure what sort of proof different banks would need maybe just the confirmation of is enough this is the part of my post that should directly answer your question which using this terminology boils down to what sorts of expenses can i use the withdrawals for to this from what i 've read out there i would say that you could probably purchase anything from the student 's point of view they are enrolled in a qualifying education institution and if they do n't spend the money on education related purchases money required for those purchases will have to come from somewhere else anyway   other withdrawals any other type of withdrawal is like walking through a you can withdraw the original contributions without paying tax on them but you would need to pay back the corresponding cesg back to the government other types of withdrawals would be taxable and may incur a 20 penalty i do n't have any more details on that as i mentioned this is from what i 've read and looked into for future resp purposes a new concept that has popped up is resp vs tfsa the tfsa provides the same tax shelter after tax dollar contributions no tax on the gains but also allows for no tax on the withdrawals to add to that the tfsa withdrawals are tax free as well the main benefit that the resp offers that the tfsa does n't is the cesg my current opinion and i could be wrong is that you should contribute $ 2500 annually to the resp in order to get the $ 500 max cesg and anything else that you 'd like to contribute should go in a tfsa but i digress hopefully my long winded response makes some sense enjoy

last question first   the amount borrowed will not transfer to your loved ones upon death   even if you were age 50 it is somewhat unlikely you will die in 30 years first question   are you okay with having a student loan that long   keep in mind that making payments for that long will hinder your ability to build wealth buy a home and have disposable income presumably you are used to living like a college student   if you continue to do so and maybe take on another job for the time you used to spend in school you could be done with this much sooner   2k month is doable and retires this in 5 years but i would shoot for a shorter time frame than that hopefully by purposely incurring that much debt you bought yourself a high paying career

i believe that your dilemma comes from not having clearly defined consequences of buying it on one side you want it and you can afford it but on the other side there is nothing solid just some vague dislike of spending money and guilt of buying something useless you 're basically guilt tripping yourself into not buying it and guilt tripping is always bad what you need is clear cut consequence something like i can buy x but then i wo n't get y and z and for that you need a clearly laid out budget just to know how much you can spend money that go into things that are absolutely required money that go into various saving plans etc and after that you 're left with some clear amount that should be spent on making yourself happier making yourself happier is not something you should feel guilty about it 's actually one of purposes of life making yourself happy is only bad if it 's hurting other areas of your life and even that is relative because there is always some extent of degradation you 're willing to accept or you have already accepted there is absolutely no point in saving every single penny you can because that will make you live long and unhappy life and die without enjoying your riches

in short no or not retroactively there really are multiple companies involved each of which bills you separately for the services they provided this can be partly avoided by selecting either a high end health plan with lower out of pocket maximum costs more up front of course or by selecting a genuine health management organization not a ppo which gathers more of the services into a single business either of these would result in fewer cash payments needing to be sent   but i do n't know of any way to simplify things after the fact even if there was a consolidation service you would have to forward the bills to them which really would n't be any easier than just paying the bills i 'm assuming you are in the us where we have a health insurance system rather than a health system other countries may handle this differently

the s&p 500 is an index this refers to a specific collection of securities which is held in perfect proportion the dollar value of an index is scaled arbitrarily and is based off of an arbitrary starting price side note this is why an index never has a split lets look at what assumptions are included in the pricing of an index all securities are held in perfect proportion this means that if you invest $ 100 in the index you will receive shares of ibm shares of general motors etc also if a security is added dropped from the list you are immediately rebalancing the remaining money zero commissions are charged when the index is calculated they are using the current price last trade of the underlying securities they are not actually purchasing them therefore it assumes that securities may be purchased without commission or other liquidity costs also closely related is the following the current price has full liquidity if the last quoted price is $ 20 for a security the index assumes that you can purchase an arbitrary amount of the security at that price with a counterparty that is willing to trade dividends are distributed immediately if you own 500 equities and most distributed dividends quarterly this means you will receive on average 4 dividends per day management is free all equities can be purchased with zero research and administrative costs there is no gains tax trading required by the assumptions above would change your holdings constantly and you are exempt from short term or long term capital gains taxes each one of these assumptions is of course invalid and the fund which endeavors to track the index must make several decisions in how to closely track the index while avoiding the problems costs caused by the assumptions these are shortcuts or each shortcut leads to performance which does not exactly match the index management fees fees are charged to the investor as load annual fees and/or redemptions securities are purchased at real prices if facebook were removed from the s&p 500 overnight tonight the fund would sell its shares at the price buyers are bidding the next market day at this could be significantly different than the price today which the index records securities are purchased in blocks rather than buying shares of general motors each time someone invests a dollar they wait for a few people and then buy a full share or a round lot securities are substituted with lots of analysis it may be determined that two stocks move in tandem the fund may purchase two shares of general motors rather than one of general motors and ford this halves transaction costs debt is used as part of substitution equities may be replaced by options option pricing shows that ownership of options is equivalent to holding an amount of debt other forms of leverage may also be employed to achieve desired market exposure see also beta   dividends are bundled vfinx the largest s&p 500 tracking fund pays dividends quarterly rather than immediately as earned the dividend money which is not paid to you is either deployed to buy other securities or put into a sinking fund for payment there are many reasons why you ca n't get the actual performance quoted in an index and for other more exotic indices like vix the volatility index even more so the best you can do is work with someone that has a good reputation and measure their performance

it depends on how much you save how much your savings earns each year   you can model it with a very simple spreadsheet   formula view   you can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model this spreadsheet presumes that you only make $ never get a raise that your savings earns 6 per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008 the article never states the assumptions that the author has made and therefore we ca n't honestly determine how truthful the author is   i recommend the book engineering your retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details about what you should expect i wrote a slightly more detailed post that showed a spreadsheet that is basically what i use at home to track my retirement savings

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally

i would not classify utilities including electric as additional fees   in many cases you interact directly with the utility not the landlord and pay for what you use   there are exceptions like when renting a room the renter 's insurance also is not part of the landlord 's profit it is simply there to protect you   in the case of loss the landlord can not insure your property you have to provide your own insurance   its pretty low costs typically less than 20 per month the application fee is typical    the move in fee is something that could be negotiated away and sounds pretty sketchy    you can always let your fingers do the walking and find out the fees before you look at the place

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

this is a hard question to answer   government debt and mortgages are loosely related   banks typically use yields on government bonds to determine mortgage interest rates   the banks must be able to get higher rates from the mortgage otherwise they would buy government bonds your question mentions default so i 'm assuming a country has on its promise to pay either the principal or interest on government bonds the main thing to consider is who does not get their money   in other words who does the government decide not to pay   this is the important part   the government will have some money so they could pay some bond holders   they must decide who to for example let 's look at who holds greek government debt   around 70 of greek government debt is held outside greece   see table below   the greek government could decide to default only on the debt to foreign holders   in that case the banks in france and switzerland would take the loss on their bonds   this could cause severe problems in france and switzerland depending on the percentage of greek bonds that make up the banks assets   greek banks would still face losses however since the price of their greek bond holdings would drop sharply when the government defaults   interestingly the losses for the greek banks may be smaller than the losses faced by the french and swiss banks   this is usually the favored option chosen by government since the french and swiss do n't vote in greece yields on greek government bonds would rise dramatically   if your greek mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage then you could see some big adjustments upward   if you live in france or switzerland then the bank that owns your mortgage may go under if greece defaults   during liquidation the bank will sell their assets which includes mortgages and you will probably not notice any difference in your mortgage as i stated earlier this is a hard question to answer since the two financial instruments involved bonds and mortgages are similar but may or may not be related

correcting keith 's answer you should have read about these details in the terms and conditions of your bank broker orders are like a soft limit order and meaningless without a validity which is typically between 1 and 5 days if you buy silver at an price above market price say x when the market offer is m then parts of your order will likely be filled at the market price   for the remaining quantity there is now a limit the bank broker might fill your order over the next 5 days or however long the validity is at various prices such that the overall average price does not exceed x. this is different to a limit order as it allows the bank broker to partially buy silver at higher prices than x as long as the overall averages is x or less   in a limit set up you might be partially filled at market prices first but if the market moves above x the bank broker will not fill any remaining quantities of your order so you might end up after a day or 5 days with a partially filled order also note that an price below the market price and with a short enough validity behaves like a limit price the 4th order type is sort of an opposite side limit price a stop buy means buy when the market offer quote goes above a certain price a stop sell means sell when the market bid quote goes below a certain price paired with the principle this might mean that you buy sell on average above below the price you give i do n't know how big your orders are or will be but always keep in mind that not all of your order might be filled immediately a so called partial fill   this is particularly noteworthy when you 're in a pro rata market

most of it is probably due to ignorance and disbelief a few years ago i started doing week long trades with my ira for a while i would make money each time and over the first year i had about a 20 rate of return if you asked me if i thought i was smarter than other people in the market i would've told you no i just spent more time and most people accepted a small financial penalty for not having to spend the time directly managing their portfolio then i made a few poor choices and all my previous earnings disappeared quickly in the short term yeah things were great but that did n't extrapolate out so now that i 'm a few years into investing i 'm almost entirely in index funds

stock price is an indicator about the health of the company   increased profits for example will drive the stock price up excessive debt for example will drive it down the stock price has a profound effect on the company overall for example a declining share price will make it hard to secure credit attract further investors build partnerships etc   also employees are often holding options or in a stock purchase plan so a declining share price can severely dampen morale in an extreme case if share prices plummet too far the company can be pressured to reverse split the shares and eventually take the company private   this recently happened to playboy

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

that is a loaded question but i 'll give it a shot   first things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks   if you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks   stocks return around in the long run so you 'd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a roth ira   if you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning you will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan drip that you could invest in directly with the company you will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you   since you seem to be internet savvy i suggest you use a discount brokerage that let 's you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions   a good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward   just place an order for the amount of shares you want   that order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price   or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur there are lots of good books out there for beginners   personally i learned from the motley fool and last but not least is to have fun with it   learn as much as you can and welcome to the club

in practice most maybe all stock indices are constructed by taking a weighted average of stock prices denominated in a single currency and so the index implicitly does have that currency as you suggest us dollars for the s&p 500 in principle you can buy one unit of the s&p 500 for $ or whatever by buying an appropriate quantity of each of its constituent stocks also in a more realistic scenario where you buy an index via a tracker fund you would typically need to buy using the underlying currency of the index and your returns will be relative to that currency if the index goes up by 10 your original investment in dollars is up by 10

here 's what my wife and i did first we stopped using credit cards and got rid of all other expenses that we absolutely did n't need   a few examples cable tv home phone high end internet all shut off   we changed our cell phone plan to a cheap one and stopped going out to restaurants or bars   we also got rid of the cars that had payments on them and replaced them with ones we paid cash for   probably the most painful thing for me was selling a 2 year old and replacing it with a 5 year old random 4 door    some people might tell you do n't do this because older cars need repairs   fact is nearly all cars are going to need repairs   it 's just a matter of whether you are also making payments on it when they need them and if you can discipline yourself enough to save up a bit to cover those after doing all this the only payments we had to make were for the house plus electric gas water and the debt we had accumulated   i 'd say that if you have the option to move back into your parent 's house then do it   yes it will suck for a while but you 'll be able to pay everything off so much faster   just make sure to help around the house ignore the guys saying that this tanks your score and will make getting a house difficult   although they are right that it will drop your score the fact is that you are n't in any position to make large purchases anyway and wo n't be for quite some time so it really does n't matter   your number one goal is to dig yourself out of this hole not engage in activity that will keep you in it next if you are only working part time then you need to do one of two things   either get a full time job or go find a second part time one   the preference is obviously on the first which you should be able to do in your spare time   if for some reason you do n't have the tech skills necessary to do this then go find any part time job you can    it took us about 3 years to finally pay everything except the house off we owed a lot   during that time everything we bought was paid for in cash with the vast majority of our money going to pay off those accounts once the final account was paid off i did go ahead and get a credit card   i made very minor purchases on it mostly just gas and paid it off a few days before it was due each month   every 4 months they increased my limit    after around 18 months of using that one card my credit score was back in the 700 + range and with no debt other than the mortgage note i echo what others have said about credit repair companies   anything they can do you can too   it 's a matter of cutting costs living within your means and paying the bills   if the interest rates are killing you then try to get a consolidation loan   if you ca n't do that then negotiate settlements with them just get everything in writing prior to making a payment on it if you go this route   btw make sure you actually ca n't pay them before attempting to settle

for press releases about economic data the bureau of economic analysis press release page is helpful depending on the series you could also look at the bureau of labor statistics press release page   for time series of both historical and present data the st. louis federal reserve maintains a database such data including numerous measures of gdp called fred they list nearly 15,000 series related to gdp alone fred is extremely useful because it allows you to make graphs that indicate areas of recession like this   on the series homepage there 's a bold link on the left side to download the data if you simply need the most recent data it 's listed below the graph on that page   if you 're interested in a more in depth analysis you can use the bureau of economic analysis as well specifically the national income and product accounts which are most of the numbers that feed into the calculation of gdp fred also archives some of these data both fred and the bea compile data on numerous other economic benchmarks as well   other general sources for a wide range of announcements are the yahoo bloomberg and the wall street journal economic calendars these provide the dates of many economic announcements e.g. existing home sales durable orders crude inventories etc yahoo provides links to the raw data where available bloomberg and the wsj provide links to their article where appropriate this is a great way to learn about various announcements and how they affect the markets for example the somewhat disappointing durable orders announcement recently pushed markets down a few points   for europe look at on the left side of the page they list links to common data including gdp they list the latest releases on the home page that i previously linked to   for the sake of keeping this question short i 'm the rest of the world into this paragraph data for many other countries is maintained by their governments or central banks in a similar fashion the world bank 's also has relevant data like gross national income which is n't identical to gdp but it 's another less common macroeconomic indicator   you can also look at the economic calendar on or xe.com which list events for the us europe and some latin american countries if you 're only interested in the us the bloomberg or yahoo calendars may have a higher signal to noise ratio but if you 're interested in following how global markets like currency markets respond to new information a global economic calendar is a must also has a global economic calendar that according to them is specifically geared towards events that affect the forex market   as i said governments and central banks compile a lot of this data so to make searching easier here are a few links to statistical agencies and central banks for major countries i compiled this list a while ago on my personal machine so although i think all the links are accurate leave a comment if something is n't quite right   statistics australia brazil canada canada china france germany imf japan mexico oecd thailand uk us central banks australia brazil canada chile china ecb hungary india indonesia israel japan mexico norway russia sweden switzerland thailand uk us

right the definition of made with 100 chicken changes depending on whether that particular company sources soy protein and chicken separately and mixes them vs purchasing it already mixed the consumer does n't care if this particular company is putting the chicken and the soy together all they care about is what 's in the package that 's what i mean by the fact that at some level everything with chicken is made with 100 chicken legally they ca n't say that it 's made with 100 chicken unless one of the items they purchase from a supplier is just chicken but morally biologically and logically it is the same whether they put the chicken into their mixing pot or an upstream supplier does   lets take a concrete example this breakfast products sandwiches smoke chicken sausage egg whites and cheese sandwiches is made with 100 chicken obviously the entire food product is not chicken but i would n't be surprised if someone walking down the aisle and picking it up thought subconsciously that the patty on it was 100 chicken is it actually no it is chicken and water and other stuff but what we are actually supposed to infer from that language is that the company who makes this sandwich purchases 100 chicken whatever that is and mixes it with the rest of the ingredients to made something which is mostly chicken in legal land that is all that can be inferred from the statement it 's not exactly deceptive but it 's definitely not the clearest terminology that could be employed and it definitely implies something that simply made with chicken does not imply   i agree with you that the package almost always has all the information i would reasonably want on it though and in many cases it is obvious that same sandwich lists all of the ingredients of the patty on the back so the information is right there if you want to go to the small text

purchases and sales from the same trade date will both settle on the same settlement date they do n't have to pay for their purchases until later either because hft typically make many offsetting trades buying selling buying selling buying selling etc when the purchases and sales settle the amount they pay for their purchases will roughly cancel with the amount they receive for their sales the difference being their profit or loss margin accounts and just having extra cash around can increase their ability to have trades that do not perfectly offset in practice the hft 's broker will take a smaller amount of cash e.g. $ 1 million as a deposit of capital and will then allow the hft to trade a larger amount of stock value long or short e.g. $ 10 million for 10:1 leverage that $ 1 million needs to be enough to cover the net profit loss when the trades settle and the broker will monitor this to ensure that deposit will be enough

look for offers for 0 or low apr on balance transfers it is more likely to get a promotional apr on balance transfer than to lower the apr you already have of course try to pay off the balance as long as you 're in the period of the promotion because otherwise you 'll end up paying the high rate again if you can not get such an offer low credit etc then just try to pay off asap and start rebuilding your credit not much there btw when you consider the balance transfer promotions look at 3 things the promotion period when it ends so that you 'd know how much time you have to pay it off the balance transfer fee usually the balance transfer itself is not free and you pay 3 5 on the transfer if you have 0 apr for 12 months it makes it effectively 5 apr for the 5 fee if the period is lesser the apr is higher take that into the account the apr after the promotion in case you ca n't pay off in that time frame

scenario 1 is typically the better description if commercial banks were allowed to simply create money they would n't be in the mess they 're in now in the u.s. the central bank is the federal reserve or fed and is the only entity not the government not the banks not the people that is allowed to create money out of thin air it does this primarily by buying government debt the government spends more than it takes in and so to come up with the deficit it issues bonds the fed buys a certain amount of these bonds and simply prints the money or more realistically authorized the electronic transfer of $ x to the treasury which the government then spends that places money in the hands of corporations and the people who turn around and spend it however long term the interest charges on money borrowed from the fed will actually remove money from the economy the central banks therefore have to constantly make marginal changes to various monetary policy tools they have when the economy is just along if they do nothing then too much of a short term increase in money supply will result in there being too much money which makes an individual monetary unit worth less inflation while making money too hard to get will reduce the rate at which it 's spent reducing gdp and causing recessions the exact scenario you describe is typically seen in cases where the government is running with a balanced budget and the central bank thus ca n't give its new money to the government to spend when it wants to increase the money supply in that situation the central bank instead lowers its lending rate the percentage interest that it will charge on loans made to other banks thereby encouraging those banks to borrow more of the money created by the central bank those banks will then use the money to make loans invest in the market etc etc which puts the money in the economy   in the u.s. the fed does have this tool as well but increases or decreases in the federal funds rate are typically used to influence the rate that banks charge each other to borrow money thus encouraging or discouraging this lending a lowering in the interest rate makes banks more likely to borrow from each other and from the fed but the amount of money created this way is a drop in the bucket compared to current quantitative easing and thus increases the turnover of the existing money in the economy how many times a theoretical individual dollar is spent in a given time period

i would advise to never cash out retirement funds unless you 're actually retired or in case of an extreme emergency not only because of the huge tax bill that you 'd incur as mentioned in addition to your top bracket rate add 10 but also because you will never be able to recover from the loss your current retirement fund is the one that will compound the most by the time you deposit the same amounts you 're thinking of withdrawing now the compound effect would have grown the original amount further by the time you could catch up it would compound further you will never be able to repair the damage of early withdrawal at this stage consider this calculation lets say you worked for 10 years out of 40 years of your career path and have $ 1 k to deposit a year for ease of computation essentially by withdrawing now you 'll reduce your retirement savings by about 50 in thirty years from now how much is that 6 interest on your student loan i seriously doubt its worth it

wow very by some of the answers i will comment on those later to directly answer your question here is a link to a brochure that explains the three basic and is written in straightforward language link text that is step one step 2 is a question cheapest when initially or for long term without a doubt term initially is the cheapest however every 10 years or 20 years it increases in price as the name term implies it is temporary coverage will end at some point 75 or 80 depending upon plan design chosen it is possible that if you choose term you can outlive your coverage and all you have are a bunch of cancelled cheques young people with a mortgage children and other debts should buy a lot of term as the mortgage will be paid off the kids will no longer be dependent these needs are temporary however some needs are permanent what about leaving a legacy at death to a charity insurance is a good solution and can provide a tax deduction too term is n't a good fit or a business owner wishing to transfer his her business at death to their children taxes will be due and permanent insurance such as whole life and universal life can be arranged to provide cash to pay tax whenever this happens   let me ask you who received 10 in the last ten years on their equity portfolio almost zero people did however a whole plan would have generated a guaranteed return of 3.0 plus a non guaranteed return via dividends that the combined internal rate of return   on a combined basis would be about 5.6 after taxes life a bond portfolio yield internal rate of return is dependent on age at buying years of investing all insurance software can show you the internal rate of return irr is what is the return after tax that you must get to equal the equity or death benefit from a permanent insurance plan someone mentioned by term and invest the difference that is what universal life is term and invest the difference except the difference is growing tax sheltered outside investments with comparable risk are taxable there is no easy answer for what type is right often a combination is the key question you should ask is how much is enough then consider types based upon your needs and budget here is a link where you can calculate how much you need i hope this helps a bit

yes what you are describing is an off exchange trade and can be done using stock certificates here you will privately negotiate with the seller on a price and delivery details that is the old school way to do it many companies about 20 of the s&p 500 will not issue paper certificates and you may run a hefty printing fee up to $ 500 source wikipedia above other other type of private party transactions include a deal negotiated between two parties and settled immediately or based on a future event for example warren buffet created a deal with goldman sachs where warren would have the choice to purchase gs shares in the future at a certain price this was to be settled with actual shares rather than cash settled ignoring that he later canceled this agreement if it were to go through the transaction would still have been handled by a broker transferring the shares you can purchase directly from a company using a direct stock purchase plan just pick up the phone ask for their investor relations and then ask if they offer this option if not they will be glad for your interest and look into setting it up for you

i regularly transfer money from the us to europe and have found a simple us check a pretty useful way if you are not in a hurry you write a us dollar based check to yourself and deposit it to a bank in your new location which implies you open an account in france yes it takes some days 7 days and then the money will be deposited the local bank will convert it so you can walk around and pick a bank that has a rate concept that pleases you before you open the account and there will be no fees on the us side which means you can get every last dollar out of the account also you have the control over how much you pull when you can write yourself as many checks as you like assuming you took your checkbook this was the best rate i could get considering that wire transfers cost significant fees there are probably other options if you are talking serious money like 100 or more there will better ways but most banks will be eager to help you with that note that as long as you make interest income in the us you are required to file taxes in the us your visa status and location do n't matter

without going into minor details an fx transaction works essentially like this let 's assume you have sek 100 on your account if you buy 100 usd rub at 1.00 then that transaction creates a positive cash balance on your account of usd 100 and a negative cash balance an overdraft of rub 100 so right after the transaction assuming there is not transaction cost the net equity of your account is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 100 = 100 sek let 's say that the day after the rub has gone down by 10 and the rub 100 is now worth sek 90 only your new equity is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 90 = 110 sek and you 've made 10 congrats had you instead bought 100 sek rub the result would have been the same assuming the usd sek rate constant in practice the usd sek rate would probably not be constant and you would need to also account for in your example the usd rub has gone up 10 but the rub has gone down hence the result you find in my example the rub has gone down 10 i.e. the usd has gone up 11

the terms debit and credit come from double entry book keeping in this system every transaction is applied against two accounts it debits one and credits the other by equal amounts or more technically it affects two or more accounts and the total of the credits equals the total of the debits whether a debit or a credit adds or subtracts from the balance depends on the type of account the types of accounts were defined so that it is always possible to have these matching debits and credits assets like cash or property that you own are debit accounts that is a debit is an increase in the balance of the account liabilities like money you owe are credit accounts that is a credit is an increase to get into all the details would require giving a tutorial on double entry book keeping which i think is beyond the scope of a forum post by a quick bing search i find this one i have n't gone through it so i ca n't say if it 's a particularly good tutorial there are plenty of others on the web and in bookstores note that the terminology can be backwards when someone you 're doing business with is describing the account because their viewpoint may be the opposite of yours for example to me my credit card is a liability i owe the bank money so when i post a charge that 's a credit and when i pay it off that 's a debit but to the bank my account is an asset the customer me owes them money so to the bank a charge is a debit and a payment is a credit

yes this is related to our economy   you see israel is basically a jewish state and has spent the last 50 years killing unarmed women and children in palestine and building illegal settlements they as a part of government policy deny their own arab citizens rights and as such are not a democracy they are an apartheid state   now jews are jews first and then any thing else like for instance american citizens they are jews first and will always put first   well that s all fine but jews also control the us economy and exert a great deal of control on the us politics via their control of the purse strings   but america is supposed to be the of democracy and human rights and is forced to publicly   support israel which is now known to the world as an apartheid state and a of and strife and the root cause of terrorism and therefor by aligning with the israeli 's and giving them weapons and military aid america shows it self as a hypocritical liar and a shallow state and grow in its isolation   all the while israel keeps about war and iran and syria and now russia and forcing america to its own destruction while siphoning off all the fat from the us economy into jewish pockets   that village is the death of the us economy

i 'm not downvoting you because i can relate in a way to your post and i think this is a good topic to have on this site   we had a question a couple weeks ago where someone like you took some friend 's money to trade with but did n't know how to give the money back or calculate the net return   it is not smart to take and invest other people 's money when you have zero industry experience and when you do not understand the legal requirements of handling someone else 's money within the first 12 months of my brokerage account i had returned something like 150 i doubled my money plus a bit   the next year was something like -20 if i remember correctly the next year was worse then up again for year four   year 1 i thought i was a genius and had figured this whole thing out year 2 put me in my place and year 3 kicked me while i was down you have 6 months of pretty solid returns good for you   i do n't think that means it 's time to set up shop   really i think you need to sit down and think long and hard about the implications legal and otherwise of holding other people 's money   running a fund is significantly different than trading your own money    retail investors do n't typically have a good memory   great you made me 17 last year and 25 the year before but right now i 'm down 10 so give me my money back because i would have been better off in an savings account this year     this is why index funds are in vogue right now   lots of people have had money in active funds that have or matched the safe and passive index funds so they 're angry   retail folks get the instant they lose money no matter how much   you need to be ready to contend with what have you done for me lately the instant something turns negative no matter how positive your returns have been at your stage in the game you should get a job and continue putting your own money in to your own system and be ready to lose some of it   i doubt there is anyone outside your immediate family who will hand a random 18 year old kid any significant amount of money to trade their system based on 6 months of success certainly not more than you have in there currently

oh i see what you mean it depends which side you look at it from the company or the individual investor   for the individual investor i guess it does n't matter as you said you only buy the amount of stocks you can afford what matters afterwards is whether the price of your stocks goes up or down that 's when the company valuation comes into play if a company is overvalued the stock prices are going to go down until they reach the equilibrium wiki or stocks go down when more people will want to sell than buy creating an excess supply so sellers will be willing to offer lower prices so you buy from them stocks go up when the opposite happens more people will want to buy than sell so buyers will have to offer more money to convince sellers to sell   in essence facebook was overvalued and not enough people were buying their shares creating excess supply so sellers had to offer lower prices had facebook been properly valued people would've felt the stocks were a good price everyone would've rushed to purchase and stock prices would've gone up

if you have nt yet maxed out your isa then its a no brainer you get excellent tax rebates and its silly not to take advantage of these before considering self investing in shares    note that even if your isa is maxed out the economic means that investing in individual stocks is an intimidating place for beginners right now   the fsa is also looking at the average percentages used for pension from 7 for adventurous investments down to 5 or 6 so there is industry wide recognition that on average the stock market is going to be a little less lucrative than it was a few years ago that s not to say you ca nt still make a whopping profit but the chances of you doing so as a first time investor are remote to say the least my advice would be to look seriously into some of the social lending sites where you can still easily get a 7 return with minimal risk whilst i do have a portfolio which is performing well overall i am a very speculative investor i am moving a lot of funds into as i am averaging 7 return with a lot less time effort and risk than the stockmarket   whatever you decide i think its time you thought about consulting an ifa they can help you understand what sort of risk you are willing to tolerate which is a very important aspect of investing

yes you are assuming that everything remains equal except for a decrease in revenue more than likely what you will see happen and what is expected to happen is a decrease in benefits along with a decrease in revenue so rather than say revenue of 1000 and payout of 1000 it would become something more like revenue of 750 and payout of 750 and then maybe further down the road revenue 600 and payout 600 but it is unlikely that we continue to see revenue of 750 and payout of 1000 this is a very very simple explanation and i 'm sure someone could use better numbers but i think it illustrates why we wo n't see social security go bankrupt

if your business is operating on an accrual basis the income would be counted as occurring in 2016   if your business is operating on a cash basis the income would be counted as occurring in 2017   if you do n't know what that means you are probably using a cash basis for your business which means income and expenses take place when you actually receive or incur them according to cash based principles if you receive the check in 2017 that is when you report the income   for more information see accounting methods in publication 538 in summary you can choose both as an individual and as a business which accounting method you want to use and it is not trivial to change it cash basis on a calendar year is more or less the default and is recommended unless you have a specific reason for doing something else

if by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then i doubt that it is really that easy in pakistani context at present the exchange rate is 107 pakistani rupees per us dollar so even with this exchange rate to have a million us dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old pakistani to have that much wealth and by the time you have 107 million pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the us dollar would have only gone up against pakistani currency that article which you have mentioned makes calculations in us context and dollar terms however if you talk only in terms of your country 's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time

this person could buy another car at any moment without any money problems so i do n't really see any point in insuring especially with such a ridiculously high price compared to the extremely low risk convenience   if you self insure then an accident means that you have to make arrangements to get the car fixed evaluated etc   if you buy insurance your insurer would prefer to do all that   they argue with the mechanic over prices the lawyer over liability etc    and of course rich people need more liability insurance than other people not less   so part of that $ 1400 is probably money that your friend would have to pay regardless

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

i ca n't say if there is anything specific that makes lending illegal but if your company goes bankrupt you might end up in trouble   first it 's a loan it must be repaid it must be in the books as a loan and if your company could n't pay its bills you would have to ask for the money back if the company goes bankrupt your creditors will ask for the loan to be repaid   now if things are worse your company goes bankrupt and the person can not pay back the money then you could get into real trouble creditors wo n't like that situation at all they will claim that you moved that money aside to protect it from creditors they might be able to force you personally to pay or even start criminal charges against you if you ca n't pay either   in the uk and probably elsewhere it 's criminal for the company to pay dividends if that means it can not fulfil its financial obligations if there is no money left because of that loan then you ca n't get dividend payments from your company   so as long as your company 's finances are fine and that person 's finances are fine you will be ok except i do n't know if you would need a license but if there are financial problems then being an llc might not protect you

unless you 're running a self employed business with a significant turnover more than £ 150k you are entitled to use cash basis accounting for your tax return which means you would put the date of transactions as the payment date rather than the billing date or the date a debt is incurred for payments which have a lag e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect you can pick one as long as you 're consistent you can choose how you record when money is received or     paid eg the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque    is written but you must use the same method each tax year

because it 's not cheaper it 's virtually free to run a private chain no transaction fees no competition for mining it does n't require even a of a fraction of the maintenance resources and you maintain total operational control over it bitcoin could crash it 's encryption could be broken 100 's of things could change which would totally your internal infrastructure lastly if you want you can destroy the chain say if you are sharing private documents with another legal firm you can destroy the chain when the case is done the documents wo nt be floating in a public chain for perpetuity   the mega chain is a very stupid idea because it forces everything to be hosted by everyone which very quickly loses feasibility instead you will likely see an increase in very specific use case chains

thanks for replying i think we are talking at cross purposes though in your original example you were talking terms of a promise to pay at a future time in that example the asset might be destroyed but the promise to pay would still be binding under typical laws of obligations and so a court could enforce the to pay unless perhaps the promise was itself eg by being contingent on the asset the apples being harvested ie not being destroyed so my question was really whether such a contingent promise really amounts to creating new money as is suggested by the original example i do n't see a promise of this nature can be akin to creating money it is a new bargain entered into by two or more parties

i 've read the answers and respect the thought behind them   i 'd like to focus on a the magnitude of the emergency and b the saving rate of the people affected 3 6 months is interesting it 's enough not just to fix the car repair the a c etc but more than enough to lose one 's job and recover let 's avoid the debate of how long it take to find a job no amount of emergency savings can solve that if one is spending below their means any unexpected expense that can paid off within say 3 months does n't really need to tap emergency funds ef and at some level of income and retirement savings one can more easily run a much lower ef   my own situation i had worth of expenses saved as ef we were living well beneath our means and i was looking at the difference between our mortgage vs bank interest near 0 i used the funds to pay down principal refinanced to a lower rate and at the same closing got a heloc the psychology of this is tough it then appears that for simple expenses i 'd be borrowing from my heloc on the other hand the choice was between a known cost the $ 5k year the money was costing by sitting there plus the lower rate by going to a non jumbo loan at the time vs the risk of using 3 money from the heloc in the end the heloc was never tapped for more than a small portion of its line and i never regretted the decision ironically it 's the person who is n't saving much that need the ef most if you are a saver you need to judge how long it would take to replace the funds   i offer the above not as a recommendation but as devil 's advocate to the other excellent advice here all cash flows are a choice $ 100 going here ca n't go there i 'd slip in a warning that one should capture matching 401(k contributions if offered before funding the ef and pay down any high interest debt after that the decision of how liquid to be is a personal choice what worked for my wife and me may not be for everyone

this is the sad state of us stock markets and regulation t. yes while options have cleared settled for t+1 trade + 1 day for years and now actually clear instantly on some exchanges stocks still clear settle in t+3   there really is no excuse for it if you are in a margin account regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but are n't considered margin loans   some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of margin funds you can trade with scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately i think e*trade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately if you are in a cash account you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds but you ca n't sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear or you 'll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides most brokers do n't allow this   you certainly are n't allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you are n't even liable since you 've agreed to no loan contract a margin agreement   i ca n't be sure if that actually violates reg t but when i am i 'll edit while it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity the options clearing corporation with stocks clearing settling still occurs between brokers netting their transactions between each other electronically all financial products could clear settle immediately imo and i 'd rather not start a by giving my opinion why not do n't even get me started on the bond market as to the actual process it 's called clearing settling the general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is the reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on wall st. is because they 'd have runners physically all of the certificates from building to building   then they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other   this is how we get the term bankers hours where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading   while this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker they 've conveniently kept the short hours

at 5 this means you expect rents to double every 14 years i bought a condo style apartment 28 years ago sold a while back by the way and recently saw the going rate for rents has moved up from $ 525 to $ 750 after all this time the rent has n't increased four fold   if rents appear to be too low compared to the cost of buying the house people tend to prefer to rent on the flip side if the rent can cover a mortgage and then some there 's strong motivation to buy if not by the renters then by investors who seek a high return from renting those houses thereby pushing the price up   the price to rent ratio is n't fixed it depends in part on interest rates consumer sentiment and banks willingness to lend similar to stock 's p e there can be quite a range but too far in either direction is a sign a correction is due

there are three or four ways that a company can grow crowdfunding is a relatively new in mainstream businesses alternative financing method where people will finance a company with the expectation that they will benefit from the product or service that they provide obviously a startup has no prior income to use so it must either raise money through equity or debt people say that one must borrow contingent on their salary banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest   for individuals their income is their primary source of cash flow so yes it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan   for a business the key factor is future cash flows   so a business will borrow money say to buy a new asset like a factory that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt   if the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest they 'll loan the money equity investors are essentially the same but since they do n't get a guaranteed payback they only get paid through non guaranteed dividends or liquidation their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns so the question i 'd have as a bank or equity investor is what are you going to do with the money   what is your business strategy what are you going to do that will make profits in the future   do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business   crowdfunding would be similar people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service so any business either starts small and grows over time which is how the vast majority of businesses grow or has some special idea asset skill or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan i know again that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes the unfortunate reality is that most startups fail   which may sound bad but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are ok with failing   they are people that are willing to fail 9 times with the thought that the 10th one will take off and make up for the losses of the first 9    so i would say if you have some great idea or skill and a viable strategy and plan to take it to market then go for it you do n't need a huge salary to start off   you need something that you can take to market and make money   most people myself included either do not have that idea or skill to go out on their own or do n't have the courage to take that kind of risk   but do n't go in assuming all you need is a loan and you 'll be an instant millionaire   you might but the odds are very long

invest in a high quality dividend paying group of stocks   look up stock   to find longterm quality stocks that have regularly increased their dividends for over is a safe period of time to invest in stocks   if you had bought stocks at their in 2007 and kept them through the 40 decline thru 2008 and 2009 and held on to them for 10 years until 2017 you would have earned a 40 increase from when you purchased them   that is pretty much a worst case   if you had invested in dividend paying stocks and had earned an additional 2.5 per year you would have exceeded your 5 goal the lifetime yearly return of the stock market is 10   time is the only downside but with ten years you are almost certainly immune

let me run some simplistic numbers ignoring inflation you have the opportunity to borrow up to what matters and varies is your salary case 1 you make 22 k after graduation you pay back 90 a year for 30 years paying off at most 2700 of the loan in this case whether you borrow or 28,000 makes no difference to the paying off you would do best to borrow as much as you possibly can treating it as a grant case 2 you make 100 k after graduation you pay back over 7 k a year if you borrowed the full 51 after 7 or 8 years it would be paid off yeah yeah inflation interest but maybe that might make it 9 years in this case the more you borrow the more you have to pay back but you can easily pay it back so you do n't care invest your and savings into something long term since you know you wo n't be needing to draw on them case 3 you make 30 k after graduation here the payments you have to make actually impact how much disposable income you have you pay back a year and over 30 years that 's about 25 k of principal it will be less if you account for some even most of the payment going to interest not principal anything you borrow above 25 k or the lower more accurate amount is free if you borrow substantially less than that by using your sponsorship savings and summer job you may be able to stop paying sooner than 30 years but even if you borrow only 12 k or half the more accurate number it will still be 15 years of payments running slightly more realistic versions of these calculations where your salary goes up and you take interest into account i think you will discover for each possible salary path a number that represents how much of your loan is really loan everything above that is actually a grant you do not pay back the less you are likely to make the more of it is really grant on top of that it seems to me that no matter the loan grant ratio   borrow as much as you can from this rather bizarre source appears to be the correct answer in the cases where it 's all loan you have a lot of income and do n't care much about this loan payment borrowing the whole 51 k lets you invest all the money you get while you 're a student and you can use the returns on those investments to make the loan payments

this is a great question   i 've participated in a deal like that as an employee and i also know of friends and family who have been involved during a buyout   in short   the updated part of your question is correct there is no single typical treatment   what happens to unvested restricted stock units rsus unvested employee stock options etc varies from case to case furthermore what exactly will happen in your case ought to have been described in the grant documentation which you hopefully received when you were issued restricted stock in the first place anyway here are the two cases i 've seen happen before immediate vesting of all units   immediate vesting is often the case with rsus or options that are granted to executives or key employees   the grant documentation usually details the cases that will have immediate vesting   one of the cases is usually a change in of control or provision triggered in a buyout   other immediate vesting cases may be when the key employee is terminated without cause or dies   the terms vary and are often negotiated by shrewd key employees conversion of the units to a new schedule   if anything is more typical of regular employee level grants i think this one would be   generally such rsu or option grants will be converted at the deal price to a new schedule with identical dates and vesting percentages but a new number of units and dollar amount or strike price usually so the end result would have been the same as before the deal i 'm also curious if anybody else has been through a buyout or knows anybody who has been through a buyout and how they were treated

1 as i said the above is not actually anything like a genuine history of how money emerged it 's an explain it to a five year old parable to answer where does the money go in an economic contraction   2 it 's also not defense endorsement apology for any particular set of policies or historical theory of money it 's a picture book describing the workings of an internal combustion engine using cartoon characters not a on the social and environmental implications of american car culture    that said in the parable the reasons why the simplified in the town chose to accept the fiat currency are pretty straightforward and are actually explained   they were previously using a system of a whole bunch of separate privately issued currencies each with complex and hard to evaluate credit risks bob 's potato certificate versus jane 's potato certificate versus your apple certificate versus my deer certificate this was causing problems and confusion about how much any given certificate was actually worth    the system proposed was proposed in a way that was at least as credible as the best existing system    last but not least they accepted the new currency for exactly the same reason that you accept dollar euros or whatever because everyone else does    there was no law preventing any of them from still trading apple ious in fact we still traded them later in the example except denominated in loddars i could have asked you for the last note to denominated in apples but that would probably have been harder to trade than the currency that everyone else is using    i said i would n't get into the gold standard debate and i wo n't and here 's why the debate hinges entirely and solely on whether you believe that a good fiat currency is possible and realistically sustainable if you do then fiat currency makes a lot more sense in every respect if you do n't then fiat currency is always just a catastrophe waiting to happen    my parable shows the mechanics of how money works it does n't say whether the system is good or bad or whether they should have accepted the fiat system proposed or held out for a better one or rejected it altogether    you can argue that internal combustion engines are bad or that much better alternatives are available or that nobody should use them but that does n't make a description of they work incorrect

ignore sunk costs and look to future returns   although it feels like a loss to exit an investment from a loss position from a financial standpoint you should ignore the purchase price   if your money could be better invested somewhere else then move it there you should n't look at it as though you 'll be more financially secure because you waited longer for the stock to reach the purchase price   that 's psychological not financial some portion of your invested wealth is stuck in this particular stock   if it would take three months for the stock to get back to purchase price but only two months for an alternate investment to reach that same level then obviously faster growth is better   your goal is greater wealth not arbitrarily returning certain investments to their purchase price investments are just instrumental   you want more wealth   if an investment is not performing then ignore purchase price and costs   look at the reasonable expectations about an investment going forward

i 'd question whether a guaranteed savings instrument underperforming the stock market really is a risk or not   rather you reap what you there 's a trade off and one makes a choice   if one chooses to invest in a highly conservative low risk asset class then one should expect lower returns from it   that does n't necessarily mean the return will be lower stock markets could tank and a cd could look brilliant in hindsight but one should expect lower returns   this is what we learn from the risk return spectrum and modern portfolio theory you 've mentioned and discounted inflation risk already and that would've been one i 'd mention with respect to guaranteed savings yet one still accepts inflation risk in choosing the 3 cd because inflation is n't known in advance   if inflation happened to be 2 after the fact that just means the risk did n't materialize   but inflation could have been say 4 nevertheless i 'll try and describe the phenomenon of significantly underperforming a portfolio with more higher risk assets   i 'd suggest one of perhaps we can sum those up as the risk of investing alternatively if one were actually fully aware of the risk reward spectrum and mpt and still chose an excessive amount of low risk investments such that one would n't be able to attain reasonable investing goals then i 'd probably file the risk under psychological risk e.g. overly cautious excessive risk aversion yet the term psychological risk with respect to investing encompasses other situations as well e.g. chasing high returns fwiw the risk of also came to mind but i think that 's mostly used to describe the risk of choosing say an actively managed fund or individual stocks over a passive benchmark index investment more likely to match market returns

difference between a limit and market order is largely a trade off between price certainty and timing certainty if you think the security is already well priced the downside of a limit order is the price may never hit your limit and keep trading away from you you 'll either spend a lot of time amending your order or sitting around wishing you 'd amended your order   the downside of a market order is you do n't know the execution price ahead of time this is typically more of a issue with illiquid instruments where even smaller orders may have price impact for small trades in more liquid securities your realized price will often resemble the last traded price hope that helps both have a purpose and the best tool for the job will depend on your circumstances

option pricing models used by exchanges to calculate settlement prices premiums use a volatility measure usually describes as the current actual volatility   this is a historic volatility measure based on standard deviation across a given time period usually 30 to 90 days    during a trading session an investor can use the readily available information for a given option to infer the implied volatility   presumably you know the option pricing model black scholes   it is easy to calculate the other variables used in the pricing model the time value the strike price the spot price the risk free interest rate and anything else i may have forgotten right now   plug all of these into the model and solve for volatility   this give the implied volatility so named because it has been inferred from the current price bid or offer of course there is no guarantee that the calculated implied volatility will match the volatility used by the exchange in their calculation of fair price at settlement on the day or on the previous day 's settlement   comparing the implied volatility from the previous day 's settlement price to the implied volatility of the current price bid or offer may give you some measure of the fairness of the quoted price if there is no perceived change in future volatility   what such a comparison will do is to give you a measure of the degree to which the current market 's perception of future volatility has changed over the course of the trading day    so specific to your question you do not want to use an annualised measure   the best you can do is compare the implied volatility in the current price to the implied volatility of the previous day 's settlement price while at the same time making a subjective judgement about how you see volatility changing in the future and how this has been reflected in the current price

in answering your question as it 's written i do n't think you 're really missing something different banks offer different rates online banks or solutions such as capitalone ally barclays etc typically offer higher interest rates on basic savings accounts   there are differences between money market accounts and standard savings accounts but primarily it comes down to how you can access your cash this may vary based on bank but ally has a decent blurb about it regular savings accounts are easy to open and when you choose an    online bank like ally bank you tend to get interest rates that are    more competitive than brick and mortar counterparts according to    bankrate.com additionally as a member of the fdic ally bank gives    you peace of mind knowing that the money in your ally bank online    savings account is insured to the maximum allowed by the law   money market accounts are easy to open too and again online banks may    offer better rates than traditional banks generally you have a bit    more flexibility of access with a money market account than you do    with a savings account you can access funds in your ally bank money    market account through electronic fund transfers checks debit cards    and atm withdrawals with savings accounts your access is limited to    electronic funds transfers or telephone withdrawals and in person    withdrawals at traditional banks both types of accounts are subject    to federal transaction limits here 's a bit more information about a money market account and why the rate might be a little bit higher from a money market deposit account is a bit different the restrictions on    what a bank can do with that money are somewhat looser they can    often invest that money in things such as treasury notes certificates    of deposit municipal bonds and so on in addition to the tight    restrictions of a normal savings accounts in other words the bank    can take your money and invest it in other investments that are very    safe now outside of your question if you have $ 100 k that you want to earn interest on i 'd suggest looking at options with higher rates of return rather than a basic savings account which will top out around 1 or so what you do with that money is dependent on how quickly you need access to it and there are a lot of q&a 's on this site that cover suggestions

this whole thread stinks of entitlement the reddit hivemind has gotten into its head this misguided notion that we all deserve to be able to borrow money from banks credit card companies the government and so forth to do things we want and that if we ca n't pay it off well so what they 're big guys i 'm a little guy screw them i should get off free   you do n't have to be an ayn rand and i 'm not to see how this kind of logic is insane if you sign a contract you have to honor it period sure the banks that try to sell you crazy loans are annoying but no one 's sticking a gun to your head and it 's certainly not their responsibility when you come up short bankruptcy is a sign that you have poorly handled your finances and/or life decisions which is precisely why it rightly your credit score if you ca n't grasp why bankruptcy has different implications and thus is handled differently for incorporated businesses then you do n't get it   this is n't to say that bankruptcy law as well as consumer debt finance could n't be better regulated improved it could but reddit loves to use this stuff as an excuse for bitching and whining about how unfair it is that we have to actually pay back student loans mortgages cards etc that we you know actually promised to pay back it 's fucking inane   tl;dr hate credit card debt do n't accumulate it in the first place

crude is a cash settled blend of oman and dubai crude oil both quoted in usd   the daily settlement price is mark to market but the final settlement price is based on reported prices from dubai and oman or calculated in some cases with a known procedure averaged and then converted to yen using monthly average exchange rates as published by a reference bank see detailed rules you 're trying to go all the way back and quotes into a blend of usd quoted oils   the correct procedure here would be to go with the oman and dubai prices in the first place unless you 're trying to arbitrage the market as to why they do it this way   it 's a service   takes on all the challenges to provide customers with a steady and consistent way of trading cash oil   for physical oil all you 'd have to do is buy the blend on dubai 's and oman 's spot market   you trust 's price finding process i.e. there will be no discrepancies between your cash oil and the middle east physical oil edit as to why japan is n't buying wti directly   there 's a considerable cost of carry   wti delivery location is ok there are pipelines but it 's still a logistics act to get the oil to a port on the west coast and then have it shipped to japan   dubai 's delivery is at ali persian gulf crude can be shipped straight from al   not only is it a shorter trip but also there are more shipping companies specialised in oil deliveries to the asian why they pay in usd   persian oil is highly sought after in nearly all of asia 's economies but there 's little other exported goods from there   so naturally the market for currency crosses etc is not that liquid   at least not as liquid as to make buying persian oil a smooth deal   anyway both dubai and oman chose to follow western practice to quote their contracts in usd and maybe because of liquidity concerns also to accept usd for payment only

annualize quarterly returns       ar =   where is a decimal return e.g. 0.05   standard deviations are similar       annual sd = sd   if you have quarterly deviations if you have daily etc   as an aside for work with money riding on it it is not okay to aggregate standard deviations if there 's amongst observations at a smaller time scale volatility is often quoted this way and that 's fine but it is dangerous to do any sort of risk management with this and you 'll require more due diligence it 's a good enough approximation for napkin math though

depending on how marketable your degree is in the long run you may be better some student debt rather than slowing down your studies for example finishing finance medicine or engineering a year later would mean one less year of your life that you are earning substantial income   the only situation where slowing down your studies is of benefit is if your savings plus interest would be greater than the income you are giving up by taking longer live frugally take whatever work you can without hurting your studies do n't stress if you ca n't get this to balance perfectly i speak from experience on this   screwing around with working through school cost me 2.5 years of earning potential $ 120,000 +

this is a question with a flawed premise   credit cards do have two factor authentication on transactions they consider more at risk to be fraudulent   i 've had several times when i bought something relatively expensive and unusual for me where the cc either initially declined and sent me a text asking to confirm immediately after which they would approve the charges or approved but sent me a text right away asking to confirm after which they 'd automatically dispute if i told them to   the first is legitimately what you are asking for the second is presumably for less risky but still some risk transactions ultimately the reason they do n't allow it for every transaction is that not enough people would make use of it to be worth their time to implement it   particularly given it slows down the transaction significantly and look at the complaints at the ~10 15 seconds extra emv authentication takes imagine that as a minute or more i think you 'd get a single digit percentage of people using that service

if i am interpreting the information in your post correctly then you are completely correct that nycers is by no means worth it there is no dilemma here   in fact i think nycers a worse deal than you are giving it credit for nycers contribution costs you 6.2 of your total income because of the tax implication   the value of contributing to it is only the difference between what you can earn there and what you would earn in your 403(b   it 's not clear whether that is even a positive number   even if it is it is only some small percentage times your contribution amount which is 4.5 of your total income   the benefit of contributing to nycers is minuscule or even nonexistent   there is no way on earth that it makes up for your tax loss remember the 5 interest you get in nycers is that annually or total is compensation for the time value of money   it 's not as valuable as an immediate 5 gain on your contributions and nothing near as valuable as a 5 increase in your income   if you keep your money out of nycers then you can earn capital gains on it elsewhere like in your 403(b or in an ira when it comes to investing legally avoiding taxes is pretty much always top priority   choosing among investments is also important but not nearly as much   in your case the answer seems quite clear   stop contributing to nycers immediately

no i 'd prefer a healthcare environment where prices are so reasonable you do n't need outlandish insurance and trillion dollar government programs   but no the government refuses to negotiate why because the almost all healthcare legislation is created to enrich the industry itself obamacare is nice in theory but what it really does is give the insurance industry 30 million new customers without so much as a token discount medicare has a provision that specifically prohibits negotiation of prices on drugs    so you tell me should the role of the government be to enrich the companies by feeding them more customers err i mean enrolling more citizens or should the role of government be to keep regulation in check to where it does n't cost $ 80 for a single pair of gloves

ultimately no one really knows what causes the markets to rise and fall beyond supply and demand if more people want to buy then sell prices go up and if more people want to sell prices go down the news channels will often try to attribute a specific reason to the price move but that is largely just guess work to fill up the news pages so people have something to read you may find it interesting to read up on the elliot wave principle the crash of 2008 was a perfect elliot wave fit elliot wave theory states that social which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern the crash in september was a wave 3 down this is where the majority of people give up hope however there are still a few people who are still holding on the markets tend to about during wave 4 finally the last few people give up hope and sell out this causes the final crash of wave 5 only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again

attempting to treat every bu as a profit center is doomed for failure    some of the record keeping for charge back models are good for data collection and any bu that primarily acts as a profit center can easily do charge backs with other bus that utilize their services say a publishing company asking the bu in charge of printing to provide some internal material if the business function is not a core competency and is not a profit driver it is a cost center and should be treated as such    for cost center based bus record keeping budgeting and controlling your commitments are key however you have a higher chance of being around in some scenarios this really comes down to the kinds of leadership around the bu

the fact that you are choosing index fund means you are surely not one of those investors who can correctly judge dips but buying on dips is still important you can use a method called dollar value averaging it is better than dollar cost averaging just make sure you apply a lower limit and an upper limit to be more predictable suppose you have 10000 to invest use limits like minimum 200 investment when index is high maximum 600 investment when index is down and when index gives normal returns invest 400 do this for about 2 years more than 2 years is not recommended i myself use this method and benefit a lot

agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   i was being sarcastic    gt;but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   correlation does n't equal causation remember that this is also the same time that european japanese and soviet economies were picking back up after ww2 global production picked up and there was more international competition    gt;because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems   the eu can not print money in the same way the usa can if anything the euro is a cautionary tale about currency 's with too stringent printing limitations along with tying together a set of countries at vastly different levels of economic development    the usa is not anywhere near the point of no return and seeing as we can finance our debt at ridiculously low rates compared to the rest of the world it would be much simpler to do that than try and restructure the entire monetary system of the usa   over what the last 40 years we are at about 80 90 years now    hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years   the gold standard has not been in use for hundreds of thousands of years nor was it the only currency previous to fiat   gt;i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs   i do n't think asking my local college grad is a good way of determining the usa 's macro economic situation you 're absolutely right that there is a major major disparity of wealth problem but the gold standard is n't the reason for that unemployment insurance and welfare are also comically small portions of the budget if you wanna talk about cutting spending defense and medicare are where it 's at and you do n't even have to hurt old people or soldiers to fix them

mhoran answered the headline question but you asked could someone shed some light on and differentiate between a retirement account and alternative savings plans retirement accounts can contain nearly anything that one would consider an investment yes there are exception not the topic for today so when one says they have an s&p fund or etf and some company issued bonds etc these may or may not be held in a retirement account   in the us when we say retirement account it means a bit more than just an account earmarked for that goal it 's an account 401(k 403(b ira etc that has a special tax status money can go in pre tax and be withdrawn at retirement when you are in a lower tax bracket the roth flavor of 401(k or ira lets you deposit post tax money and never pay tax on it again if withdrawn under specific conditions   in 2013 a single earner pays 25 federal tax on taxable earnings over $ but a retiree with exactly $ 46 k in gross income who then has $ 10 k in standard deduction plus exemption has a tax of $ less than 11 average rate on that withdrawal this is the effect of the deductions 10 and 15 brackets   as with your other question there 's a lot to be said about this topic no one can answer in one post that said the second benefit of the retirement account is the mental i have retirement money not to be touched emergency money used for the broken down car or appliance replacement and other funds it does n't feel bad to tap for spending vacations etc nothing a good spreadsheet ca n't handle but a good way to keep things physically separate as well    i answered as if you are in us but the answer works if you rename the retirement accounts eg canada has similar tax structure to the us

to break it to you but it 's the republican policies of deregulation and tax cuts we ca n't afford that got us this shit sandwich    not even close year deficit is not related to taxes it 's related to increased spending while yes tax revenues fall a bit but you do n't take actions that will make tax revenues fall more putting additional burdens on companies does nt yield more tax revenue if it did why not tax them at 90 but then guess what happens along that chart curve there are no companies left   how much in additional taxes could we take in 100 billion conservatively ok genius what about the other $ 1 trillion year we spend too much   seems to me like a person living paycheck to paycheck would actually have a very good idea of what it 's like to live on the edge of bankruptcy   except for most people close to bankruptcy they never had any capital to begin with they lived pay check to pay check using credit cards buying houses buying cars    businesses must keep a much larger cushion of liquid capital and assets and must plan years in advance few individuals do this or ever will    the only correlation is that more and more liabilities are not meeting income except when an individual goes bankrupt it 's mostly on them if a company goes bankrupt it can effect hundreds or thousands of employees and the company an going bankrupt wo n't then bankrupt their creditors or vendors but a company going bankrupt very well could    i do n't know if you knew this but the united states itself is bankrupt we ca n't meet liabilities with the current income that does n't mean increased taxes to increase income it means reducing liabilities and creating an envionment where those who bring in the revenue can expand    what we 're talking about here is companies receiving additional burdens not less thus there is an incentive to decrease liabilities where possible sell or close if necessary

anything can be insured for the right price this product is offered for devices at higher risk which would be logical purpose of owner needing coverage for a specific length of time typically this would be a type of adverse selection but targets customers that typically would not require insurance on their device but as you said they may be traveling and putting their devices at added risk like all insurance companies their loss ratio losses premiums will depend on the law of large numbers and spread of risk as we know the majority of the time trips are taken electronics make it back home safely like many tech companies their advantage over conventional insurers is likely low overhead costs being on a mobile platform they likely have a fraction of the claims handling cost of a conventional insurer payments are likely automated by linking bank accounts so there is little transaction cost burden on this company in short their operation is likely highly automated with few staff and low expenses allowing them to take on a higher loss ratio than conventional insurers and still leave room for profit without having ever used this service i can tell you they likely price in anticipated fraud the same way walmart prices in inventory loss into their prices i personally would share your concern that it 'd be difficult to combat fraud on such a platform especially with no claims whom are typically the first line of defense again i answer this never having used their service but i work as an analyst at a large insurer and these would be my assumptions based on what i know of

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy

i think this is possible under very special conditions   the important part of the description here is probably retired and rich   the answers so far apply to people with normal incomes both in the sense of not rich and in the sense of earned income if you sit at the top tax bracket and get most of your income through things like dividends then you might be able to win multiple ways with the strategy described   first you get the tax deduction on the mortgage interest which everyone has properly noted is not by itself a winning game you spend more than you save    but there are other factors especially for the rich and those whose income is mostly passive i 'm not motivated enough on the hypothetical situation to come up with a detailed example but i think it 's possible that this could work out   in any case the current answers using normal sized incomes and middle tax brackets do n't necessarily give the insight that you might hope if the tax payer really is unusually wealthy and retired

i am a female that works for a photo studio in berlin i work part time as in i started at four hours per day and now i can work up to 8 if there is enough work i make 8 euro per hour not a lot but i do n't speak fluent german and i scan photos i have health insurance i have sick and vacation time 24 days   i am married to a german with a full time job so of course i have it better however if we did n't make enough money you can go and apply to get help from the government my husband said they would give him at least per month   trick is that since i am a us citizen and looking for a permanent visa in three years they check to make sure you have n't gotten any government aid they do n't want to support more people that ca n't or do n't want to work   that being said my mother in law can not work due to medical reasons and she lives very comfortably in a good apartment   our last apartment was a studio one room apartment and we paid 230 euro per month even making the money i do without my husband i could afford the basics   even now we pay 57 euro for electricity about 20 euro a month for our phones 20 euro a month for internet   it is way less expensive than the usa my mom pays about $ 90 per month my aunt sometimes has $ 1,000 electricity bills water is another $ 30 cellphone another $ 60 cable and internet another $ 120    i would say that living in the usa is far more expensive   edit to put it very simply i used to make on my own in the usa about what my husband and i both make combined in germany in the usa i could barely make ends meet i lived with my mom and sister paid as little rent as i could barely had enough for food i had a good job i was lucky to have health insurance but it was still really expensive to go to the doctor   here in berlin we have a large apartment in a nice neighborhood with paying rent and all of our must haves every month we have over 500 euro left that is pretty good in the usa i was lucky if i had $ 20 by the end of the pay period

i 'm not so sure the insider outsider distinction is the best one although it does have its uses for example if an organization has stagnated you might not want business as usual someone stuck in and a of the stagnant religion on the other hand bringing in an outsider does n't necessarily mean change they may be just as much of a of the same religion that made the organization stagnant in the first place   personally i would n't say there was a definitive ballmer era though people regularly change their own tactics and approaches and i think ballmer saw the light towards the end of his term with respect to one microsoft or at least it was one major conversion among a series of as yet ones i think satya continued much of that in his own way much like two restaurants can both be french but still be quite distinct from one another   but if even early ballmer can be different from late ballmer the important thing is probably more about how much change is happening and whether it is the right change

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

if bank b has a transfer limit set you bet that there is a nice reason for that either risk of fraud liability client preferences credit scoring etc etc for a bank the cost of denying something 1 is way lower than the potential damages and liabilities of allowing something to go through   regarding your concerns for the ach here is the summarized transaction source an whether that ’s an individual a corporation or another initiates either a direct deposit or direct payment transaction using the ach network ach transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include direct deposit of payroll government and social security benefits mortgage and bill payments online banking payments person to person p2p and business to business b2b payments to name a few instead of using paper checks ach entries are entered and transmitted electronically making transactions quicker safer and easier   the originating depository financial institution odfi enters the ach entry at the request of the originator   the odfi aggregates payments from customers and them in batches at regular predetermined intervals to an ach operator   ach operators two central clearing facilities the federal reserve or the clearing house receive batches of ach entries from the odfi   the ach transactions are sorted and made available by the ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi   the receiver ’s account is debited or credited by the rdfi according to the type of ach entry individuals businesses and other entities can all be receivers   each ach credit transaction settles in one to two business days and each debit transaction settles in just one business day as per the rules   take heed of this like   the originator initiates a direct deposit payment transaction in your scenario the originator would be b. but since the transaction amount is higher than the limit b would not even initiate the ach transaction the request would be denied so the transaction would look like this 1 usually this cost comes down to just the processing costs of the denied transaction and it is rather fail fast like for the other parties involved it may have additional costs missed deadlines penalties for not fulfilling an obligation fines etc but for the bank that is irrelevant

you can look the vanguard funds up on their website and view a risk factor provided by vanguard on a scale of 1 to 5   short term bond funds tend to get their lowest risk factor long term bond funds and blended investments go up to about 3 some stock mutual funds are 4 and some are 5 note that in 2008 swenson himself had slightly different target percentages out here that break out the international stocks into emerging versus developed markets so the average risk of this portfolio is out of 5   my guess would be that a typical twenty something who expects to retire no earlier than 60 could take more risk but i do n't know your personal goals or circumstances if you are looking to maximize return for a level of risk look into modern portfolio theory and the work of economist harry markowitz who did extensive work on the topic of maximizing the return given a set risk tolerance   more info on my question here   this question provides some great book resources for learning as well you can also check out a great comparison and contrast of different portfolio allocations here

to your question yes what you propose is typically called the back door roth you make the non deductible ira deposit and soon after convert to roth as long as you have no other existing ira the process is simple and actually a loophole that 's still open   if you have an existing ira the conversion may be partially taxed based on untaxed balance as comments frequently get overlooked i 'm adding excellent warning regarding this depending on the value of the existing traditional ira and its    pre existing basis if any the backdoor roth conversion might be     almost completely taxable example traditional ira worth $ 250 k with     zero basis new nondeductible contribution increase value to $ k     and basis $ converting $ 5.5 k into a roth ira leaves $ 250 k in the    traditional ira with basis $ that is of that $ 5500     conversion only $ was nontaxable and so not only is the     original $ 5500 taxable income to the op but he also owes taxes on     $ of that $ 5.5 k conversion in short discussions of backdoor roth conversions as a great idea should always be tempered with an acknowledgement that it does not work very well if there is any other money in the traditional ira once that nondeductible contribution enters a traditional ira it does not come out completely until all your traditional ira accounts are drained of all money all your traditional ira money is considered by the irs to be in a single pot and you ca n't set up a traditional     ira possibly with a new custodian via nondeductible contribution convert just that traditional ira account into a     roth ira account and claim that the whole conversion amount is nontaxable because all the tax deferred money is in the other iras that you have n't touched at all last you disclosed that you are depositing to a roth 401(k to the match which prompts me to ask if this is best if your marginal rate is 25 or higher you are missing the opportunity to save off the top at that rate and fill the lower brackets at retirement or via conversion any year before then when you are in a lower bracket for whatever reason see my answer for saving for retirement how much is enough which addresses this further   from new comments wo n't his roth 401k contributions max out his overall roth    contributions no they are separate numbers each with own annual limits would n't this prevent any back door roth conversions the 401(k has no effect on back door roth except for the fact that the 401(k and high income make the roth ira unavailable by normal deposit back door is the only door   at the end are you encouraging him to look for a traditional 401(k at    work to max out then contributing to a roth yes read the linked se article and consider the annual withdrawal that would get you to 25 as i wrote it would take $ to fill the 15 bracket at retirement

i 've used ofx quite a lot for international transfers they are much faster than a normal international transfer from your bank instead it ends up being a local transfer on either end which just works a heck of a lot quicker they also claim lower exchange rates in the past we have compared and sometimes found them lower and sometimes found them a little higher their fees certainly are lower though only thing is i think there was a lag setting up the account initially they need to contact you by phone so if you 're in a hurry this may be problematic and yes you will need internet banking to do this since the question is specifically about how to do this in the cheapest way possible i think the answer is to use internet banking

one issue is whether it is a scam or the collector has a right to collect another issue is the statute of limitations period on the debt   if it has expired the creditor can not get a court judgement against the borrower if the borrower contests it   however if the borrower makes a payment or promises to pay the time resets to zero starting a new period subject to valid court action   in the u.s. the length of this period varies by state   this period is different from the amount of time a debt can be listed on a credit report

scenario 2 is most likely will generate the best long term financial outcome if your friends emergency fund is truly excessive and can afford to be reduced by the amount required to payoff the vehicle loan then that will save a few dollars scenario 3 is not an approach i would recommend however if your friend has to choose between paying off the loan or maxing his roth making a few assumptions regarding the loan i figure it is probably a 4 year $ which means he is paying somewhere below $ 40 a month in interest   as speaks to people often over estimate the spread they can make with another investment compared to the interest rate on a loan however the effect of compounded tax free returns can not be ignored when you are discussing a 22 year old person contributing to a roth ira   doing some calculations assuming the car is being paid off on the first payment your friend will save just under $ 1000 the total interest that would have been paid over the life of the loan if your friend adds $ 3600 approximately one year of payments to their roth ira contributions just once assuming a 3.5 avg return and a retirement age of 65 the $ 3600 will be worth just south of $ 16k a $ return using the same investment return and tax assumptions and simplifying the $ 1000 savings as if it was all realized as a lump sum at the time of paying off the loan that $ 1000 invested in a non tax advantaged investment because the whole discussion is based on if the friend had to pick and lose the opportunity for the one year to make the additional roth ira contribution would return $

you are not perfectly clear but i will assume that your ex girlfriend owns the car and that her name is the only one on the title the fact that you paid off the loan and repaired the car is completely irrelevant from a court 's point of view you gifted the car to your girlfriend if you are listed on the title then your best move is to steal the car and hide it so she ca n't steal it back note that you are not actually stealing it if you are listed on the title since you own the car try to steal it when it is parked in some public place avoid going onto her property wait until she gets hungry then offer her $ 500 if she agrees to remove her name from the title by the way after you steal the car send a certified letter to her informing her that you have possession of the car this is so that she has no grounds to report it stolen check with the police periodically to make sure she does n't report it stolen anyway if she reports it stolen after you have notified her that you have possession then it is a crime making a false report

but i ca n't help but feel that these low rates are somehow a gimmick    to trick people into taking out loans let me help you it 's not a feeling that 's exactly what it is since the economy is down people do n't want to jeopardize what they have and keep the cash in their wallets but while keeping the money safe in the pocket it makes the economy even worse so in order to make people spend some money the rates go down so that the cost of money is lower it also means that the inflation will be on the rise which is again a reason not to keep money uninvested so yes the rates are now very low and the housing market is a buyers market so it does make sense to take out a loan at this time provided of course that you can actually repay it over time and do n't take loans you ca n't handle of course you should n't be taking loans just because the rates are low but if you were already planning on purchasing a house now would be a good time to go on with that
