at the bottom of the page you linked to nasdaq provides a link to this page on which states each finra member firm is required to report its total short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in nasdaq listed securities twice a month these reports are used to calculate short interest in nasdaq stocks finra member firms are required to report their short positions as of settlement on 1 the 15th of each month or the preceding business day if the 15th is not a business day and 2 as of settlement on the last business day of the month the reports must be filed by the second business day after the reporting settlement date finra compiles the short interest data and provides it for publication on the 8th business day after the reporting settlement date the dates you are seeing are the dates the member firms settled their trades in general also from the settlement date is the date on which payment is made to settle a trade for stocks traded on us exchanges settlement is currently three business days after the trade

having no utilization makes you an outlier it 's an unusual circumstance for most people and the scoring model can not make any predictions based on it if you think of it from the underwriter 's perspective zero utilization could mean all sorts of things are you dead indigent unable to work   when you buying a product like money or insurance whose pricing is based on risk being weird will usually make you a higher risk that said it is n't the end of the world if you are in this situation i would n't lose sleep over it

if the stock is below its purchase price there is no way to exit the position immediately without taking losses since presumably you had good reasons for buying that stock that have n't changed overnight what you should probably do is just hold it and wait for the stock to come back up otherwise you 're putting yourself into an ongoing pattern of buy high sell low which is precisely what you do n't want to do if you actually agree with the market that you made a mistake and believe that the stock will not recover any part of the loss quickly and indeed will continue going down you could sell immediately and take your losses rather than waiting and possibly taking more losses of course if the stock does recover you 've made the wrong bet there are conditions under which the pros will use futures to buffer a swing but that 's essentially a side bet and what it saves you has to be balanced against what it costs you and how certain you are that you now can predict the stock 's motion this whole thing is one of many reasons individuals are encouraged to work with index funds and to buy and hold rather than playing with individual stocks it is essentially impossible to reliably time the market so all you can do is research a stock to death before making a bet on it much easier and safer to have your money riding on the market as a whole so the behavior of any one stock does n't throw you into a panic if you ca n't deal with the fact that stocks go down as well as up you probably should n't be in the market

you 're definitely not the first to pose this question   during the peak of the housing crisis i noticed a decent amount of very high dollar properties get abandoned to their fates   individuals who can afford the mortgage on a 5 million dollar home do n't necessarily need their credit to survive so it made more sense to let the asset now a liability go and take the hit on their credit for a few years unsecured debt as mentioned is a little trickier because its backed by default by your personal estate   if the creditor is active they will sue you and likely win unless there are issues with their paperwork    thing is though you might escape some impacts of the debt to your credit rating and you might not need credit but if you were to act as a wealthy person and not new money you would observe the significant value of using credit credit allows you to leverage your wealth and expand the capacity of your money to import your overall wealth picture   it may prove best to learn that and then make more wealth on your winnings than take the short sighted approach and welch on the debt

keep in mind one possible gotcha on depositing a bonus into your 401 k tax withholding depending on whether your employer combines your bonus onto a regular paycheck you can be bitten if you allocate a large chunk to your 401k.   i suspect your bonus is like most subject to an arbitrary federal withholding requirement of 25 and if you allocate 100 of the bonus to your 401 k the 25 withholding may come out of what would ordinarily be the take home in your regular paycheck leaving you with a literal take home of zero for one pay period   there are lots of variables in that calculation obviously but it 's one a lot of people seem to overlook

the big problem with your argument is the 10 per year figure because in the long term especially if adjusted for inflation the prices have not been going up nearly that fast here is a site with some nice graphs for prices over the last 40 years and it 's pretty clear to see that pretty much just what you were talking about happened prices outpaced the ability of people to pay which progressively locked out more and more first time buyers and eventually that breaks the cycle pops the bubble and the prices adjust there is always of course the choice to not buy a house and just rent or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble sell and go back to renting   it 's interesting to note that in general rental rates did not increase at nearly the same pace as the prices in the recent bubble which of course made it harder for anyone who bought investment properties in the recent 8 years or so to cover their payments via rental revenue

the level 2 data is simply showing the depth of the market if i am trading shares with my broker i have the option of viewing only the top 10 bid ask prices in the depth or all of the data which sometimes can be a very long list with another broker i get the top ten bid and ask prices and how many orders are available for each price level or i have the option of listing each order separately for each price level in order of when the order was placed i get the same kind of data if trading options i do not know about futures because i do n't trade them simply this data may be important to a trader because it may give an indication of whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market which in turn may but not always give an indication of which way the market may be moving as an example the price depth below shows before market open with sellers the buyers in both numbers and volume   this gives an indication that prices may drop when the market opens of course there could be some good news coming out prior to market open or just after causing a flood of buyers into the market and sellers to cancel their orders this would change everything around with more buyers than sellers and indicate that prices may now be going up the market depth is an important aspect to look at before putting an order in as it can give an indication of which way the market is moving especially in a very liquid security or market

here 's the purely mathematical answer for which fees hurt more you say taking the money out has an immediate cost of $ 60,000 we need to calculate the present value of the future fees and compare it against that number let 's assume that the investment will grow at the same rate either with or without the broker that 's actually a bit generous to the broker since they 're probably investing it in funds that in turn charge fees we can calculate the present cost of the fees by calculating the difference between as it turns out this number does n't depend on how much we should expect to get as investment returns doing the math the fees cost 1 = $ that is the cost of the fees is comparable to paying nearly $ 100,000 right now nearly half the investment if there are no other options i strongly recommend taking the one time hit and investing elsewhere preferably in low cost index funds details of the derivation for simplicity assume that both fees and growth compound continuously the growth does compound continuously we do n't know about the fees but in any case the distinction is n't very significant fees occur at a continuous rate of rf = which is negative and growth occurs at rate the ops current principal is p and the present value of the fees over time is f. we therefore have the equation p = p f t solving for f we notice that the components cancel and we obtain f = p p t = p p t = p p 1 t

you 've laid out a strategy for deciding that the top of the market has passed and then realizing some gains before the market drops too far   regardless of whether this strategy is good at accomplishing its goal it can not by itself maximize your long term profits unless you have a similar strategy for deciding that the bottom of the market has passed   even if you sell at the perfect time at the top of the market you can still lose lots of money by buying at the wrong time at the bottom people have been trying to time the market like this for centuries and on average it does n't work out all that much better than just some money into the market each week and letting it sit there for 40 years so the real question is what is your investment time horizon   if you need your money a year from now well then you should n't be in the stock market in the first place   but if you have to have it in the market then your plan sounds like a good one to protect yourself from losses if you do n't need your money until 20 years from now though then every time you get in and out of the market you 're risking sacrificing all your previous smart gains with one trade   sure just leaving your money in the market can be psychologically taxing cf 2008 2009 but i guarantee that a you 'll eventually make it all back cf 2010 2014 and b you wo n't miss the top or miss the bottom since you 're not doing any trading

this is n't some new revelation pensions have been around for a long time and the bankruptcy code is complex and has developed over a long period of time along side it there is a strong reason why secured creditors are favored over unsecured creditors because we want creditors to actually make loans and finance operations investment expansion etc if you eliminate the secured creditors priority then loans do n't get made in the first place the company ca n't offer pensions let alone salaries because the company is n't likely to exist or at least it would be much smaller   the claims of employees are valid nobody is questioning that but they are just lower priority than those of secured creditors who only made loans on the promise that they could recover some assets if ever the loans go into default   this is also another reason pensions have gone out of style in favor of 401ks it is foolish to rely on whether a company will exist 10 20 or 30 years down the road companies are always rising and falling in the economy and there is no reason to expect one to just exist in perpetuity

i agree that to take the money from the defined benefit plan you are saying that you can get a better return than the plan you are taking all the risk if you take the lump sum but there are two more risks that you are taking by keeping the money in the plan even though you are decades from retirement funding risk companies and state city county governments have underfunded their pension programs due to budget pressure in some cases they have skipped payments when the market was good because they felt they were ahead of their obligations they also delayed or skipped contributions when they had a budget shortfall and wanted to not end the government company fiscal year in the red the risk is that they can get so far behind that they change their promises to current and former employees this was one of the issues with the city of detroit this year bankruptcy even though their are guarantees regarding pension benefits the pension benefit guaranty corporation does set a maximum benefit if the company goes bankrupt or the plan is terminated   you might not get all the money you were expecting while the chances of taking a haircut generally impacts people who have a long career because they are entitled to a large benefit it can impact people who do n't expect it

auto correlation is a statistical concept for measuring repeating patterns in series   in stocks it is of particular interest as if future prices can be reliably guessed from past prices a lot of money could be made    note even in cases where auto correlations are high and persistent near 1 there is still some possibility that the next time period would be down even if the previous period was up   now the important part here is that high and persistent auto correlation also means once the price falls the next period the price is also more likely to fall once one period was down the next period is more likely to be down so the price does not need to go to infinity   instead it generally would display up and down trends now the key word above for investing is persistence for stocks auto correlations are at best persistent at reasonable time scales   so even if a stock was highly auto correlated during a previous period it is tough to make consistent money off of trading on these past trending patterns   this does not mean some people do n't try

gt;why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering since that goes to helping the company but not for secondhand less necessary trading   because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company   we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money   there 's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income although the principal return is of course tax free federal and are taxed differently there is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits

tldr is the purpose of doing this to ultimately avoid any sort of capital gains paid by someone in your family your plan accomplishes this if your dad is single and you are married but if your dad is married this is probably unnecessary one side effect of this plan is both you and your dad are unnecessarily giving up a portion of your lifetime gift tax exclusion your dad is giving up somewhere between 97 $ 41 k of his exclusion if both you and he are married and 97 $ 85 k if neither you or your dad is married and when you give the $ 430 k back you are giving up to that amount minus somewhere between 14 if your dad is married and you were to simply purchase the home from your dad for $ 430 k you would both avoid dipping into your lifetime max and your dad would n't realize any capital gains if he is n't married but you are then your plan works in avoiding any capital gains paid by anyone in your family unless you end up selling the home in the future for more than $ the plan also hinges on

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online

some qualitative factors to consider when deciding whether to finance with equity vs debt for a publicly traded company     1 the case for equity is the stock trading high relative to what management believes is its intrinsic value if so raising equity may be attractive since management would be raising a lot of $ $ $ but the downside is you give up future earnings since you are diluting current ownership   2 the case for debt what is the expected return for the project in which the raised capital will be utilized for is its expected return higher than the interest payments in terms if so raising debt would be more attractive than raising equity since current ownership would not be diluted   that 's all i can think of off the top of my head right now i 'm sure there are a few more qualitative factors to consider but i think these two are the most intuitive

i 'm probably going to get a bunch of downvotes for this but here 's my not very popular point of view i think many times we tend to shoot ourselves in the foot by trying to get too clever with our money in all our we forget a few basic rules about how money works it 's better to have 0 debt and a small amount of savings than lots of debt and lots of savings debt will bite you many times even the good mortgage debt will bite you i have several friends who have gotten mortgages only to find out they had to move long before they were able to pay it off and they were n't able to sell their homes or they sold at a loss when you have debt you are restricted someone else is always holding something over your head you 're bound to it pay it off asap within reason while putting a decent amount into a high yield savings account only after the debt is gone go and be clever with your money

your title question who could afford a higher premium who could n't afford a higher monthly payment contrasts premium with monthly payment but those are the same thing   in the body of your question you list monthly payment and deductible which is entirely different the deductible is paid only if you need that much medical care in any one year   most years a person in good health pays little because of the deductible   thus the higher deductible options offer catastrophic health insurance without giving much in the way of reimbursement for regular medical expenses note the original question has been edited since

your investment is probably in a collective investment trust these are not mutual funds and are not publicly traded i.e. they are private to plan participants in your company because of this they are not required to distribute dividends like mutual funds instead they will reinvest dividends automatically increasing the value of the fund rather than number of shares as with dividend reinvestment you mention the s&p 500 fund you have tracks closely to the s&p index keep in mind there 's two indexes you could be looking at without any new contributions your fund should closely track the total return version for periods 3 months or longer minus the expense ratio if you are adding contributions to the fund you ca n't just look at the start and end balances the comparison is trickier and you 'll need to use the internal rate of return look into the xirr function in excel google sheets are not strictly required to pay dividends but are strongly tax incentivized to do so and essentially all do

speaking from experience yes this was 9 years ago though and may have changed due to stricter laws i lived in london and was moving to nyc and wanted to have a functioning bank account upon arrival i banked in london with hsbc and asked them if they could set me up they connected me with the right people in the us and after many forms i had a fully functional us bank account with a foreign address and without having a social security number and i was am just your average person you will most likely not be able to get a credit card through them because of lack of credit history unless you are ridiculously rich or go for a secured credit card but a debit card should be possible my advice is to talk to your local bank and see if they can help you although it will help if they operate in the us good luck i have heard from various expats that american express may be willing to issue cards in the states based on their existing relation with clients in other countries but i digress if you have an amex in switzerland or sweden i would recommend talking to them

why should n't i bring it up freight is one thing but if there 's an interest in increased commuter rail or other passenger rail areas where businesses would use freight rail if it was extended to them or anything like the system then it 's far more likely that the government will have to be shelling out the money instead of private organizations it takes huge capital investments and years to extend something like commuter rail and businesses probably do n't want to wait potentially decades to real the rewards of a risky venture so it will be left to public investment to extend systems into some areas that may become of activity after rail reaches them it 's not all about the freight lines

yes for sure   it would be redundant   i have three of them so what   its just more money in retirement   i would prefer a roth ira in your tax bracket and you next employer may not offer that    and yes there are tax breaks either putting money in to a ira or if you go the roth route on the way out    so if you put money in a roth now you will have some money at your tax rate in 40 years from now   and if you put money in a traditional ira when you are an employee you will save on the tax rate you are at then   so you are hedging you bets on tax rates by paying them in two different decade   personally we are probably all on a tax holiday right now and i would be that taxes will be higher in the future as they are historically pretty low right now

excellent answers so far so i will just add one additional consideration liquidity money invested in a mutual fund exclusive of retirement accounts with early withdrawal penalties has a relatively high liquidity whereas excess equity in your home from paying down early has very low liquidity to put it simply if you get in a desperate situation long term unemployment it is better to have to cash in a mutual fund than try to sell your house on the quick and move in with your mother liquidity becomes less of an issue if you also manage to fund a decent sized rainy day fund 6 9 months of living expenses

a credit card is basically a revolving loan in which you 're allowed to borrow up to a certain amount the limit and any time you borrow you pay interest   if you were to borrow $ 100 to pay for something via a credit card you 'd have a $ 100 balance on the card if you then pay $ 70 cash to the card there would be $ 30 remaining   that $ 30 balance could accrue interest the timing of that interest charge could vary the 20 you 've quoted is almost certainly apr of which the a stands for annual so that 20 would be an annual rate   it makes the most sense mind you to keep a minimal balance on a credit card as the interest rate is higher than most other loans

how much should my down payment be ideally 20 of the purchase price because with 20 of the purchase price you do n't have to pay a costly private mortgage insurance pmi   if you do n't have 20 down and come across a good property to purchase it is still a good idea to go forward with purchasing with what you are comfortable with because renting long term is generally never a good idea if you want to build wealth and become financially independent how much should i keep in my emergency fund people say 3 12 months of living expenses   keep in mind though in most cases if you lose your job you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government how long should my mortgage be 30 year amortization is the best you can always opt to pay more each month   but having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities which can yield more than mortgage interest best of luck

hello   first of all i think it 's great you 're asking the community for help   asking for help when you need it is a sign of strength and self awareness of your own limitations which we all have even the smartest business people ask questions in fact they ask the most questions   i 'm wrapping up year 2 of doing what you 're trying to do and am finally seeing real traction i am a bit older than you and started out on my own 7 years after grad school but i have learned a lot and do n't mind sharing   here 's some things you might find useful   never work for free working for equity or working for exposure is working for free   people who offer you this because you 're just starting out are parasites looking to sell your talents but not pay for them   the only thing you can take away from attempts to do this is that your talents are in demand which is good     never sell yourself short would you rather do 10 websites for a $ 1000 each or do 1 website for $ 10000   you 'll be doing a lot of projects in the middle but one very important thing to bear in mind is that one $ 10000 website is a lot less work and may make you the same amount of money or more overall   in the beginning maybe you think you need to build a portfolio but you 'd be surprised how many prospects do n't care what 's in your portfolio and in fact never look at the portfolio which leads me to the most important bit of advice   learn to sell yourself   you are your company 's first and main product   learn to sell yourself as the smart kid future fortune 500 ceo who stays up all night getting things done etc   always aim high in your proposals   you 'd be surprised how many people do n't negotiate at all   that being said always put something in your proposal that is a good idea but it beyond what their asking for   if they ask you to come down in price remove this feature and come down a little bit   develop an ability to read how interested a prospect is in your services before you spring the price on them   at your age i was waiting tables   this helped me to be able to read a customer to determine which waiter they wanted me to be the attentive one the high class one the friend or the quiet   consider taking on a side job to help you develop this skill   as i said above some prospects will sign on the line without negotiating   you might even take two proposals with you into a meeting with a prospect one priced high and one low and present the version that matches their interests   go high if they need something right now   remember you are your company 's first product   this means also that your time is the company 's first commodity    be open to other things   i have a background in mathematics and am most capable as a software developer and a web developer   but i also help other companies sell and support physical products not at all related to technology   because it 's highly profitable i do it   when you 're a one person business selling your time at the highest price is the name of the game   but growing your business will require the help of others   i found it helpful to first network with other like minded people and split project money according to skill level and time commitment on a per project basis   this will allow you to take on bigger projects     but growing the company will eventually require you to hire or contract someone at a far lower pay rate than what you 're bringing in   the laws of supply and demand require you to do this as a business person if you 're to grow the business so that the business has money beyond what you 're being paid this is where the extra money comes from selling the time of others at a higher price than you 're paying them   be conscious of this   everyone you work with is not going to be your friend   make your website awesome   it does n't have to be a work of art but let it reflect the seriousness with which you approach your customers projects   make sure there are no grammatical errors   find a website of someone highly successful who 's doing what you 're doing and emulate it   you do n't have to have a portfolio starting out   your website is your first portfolio item and if it 's awesome prospects will think you 'll do the same for them   good luck   i 'm sure i 'm not the only one here who thinks your early developed entrepreneurship is going to take you far

so i am trying to puzzle out this claim about tax cuts paying for themselves through growth   this means that for every $ 1 in revenue they in cuts they expect to get $ 1 back in revenue elsewhere like other taxes so with a high tax burden on something say 25 that $ 1 cut in revenue would need to generate $ 4 in additional value to pay for itself   i ca n't think of anything where the federal tax burden is actually 25 of the total value this looks like a pretty clear case of diminishing returns because the lower the tax burden the higher the growth needs to be in order to get the money back if we look at something on the order of sales tax say 5 that $ 1 cut needs to generate $ 20 in growth   if we flip this around and look at it as an investment these are the kinds of returns that are reserved for right time right place bets they are not the kind of returns you can expect to get from groceries and mortgages   can somebody sanity check me on this

so you have $ 100k to invest want a low maintenance investment and personal finance you to death investment companies are gon na love you   you 'll hand them a wad of cash and more or less say do what you want   you 're making someone 's day   just probably not yours mutual fund companies make money off of you regardless of whether you make money or not   they do n't care one bit how carefully you look at your investments   as long as the money is in their hands they get their fee if i had that much cash i 'd be looking around for a couple of distressed homes in good neighborhoods to buy as rentals   i could put down payments on two of them lock in fixed 30-year mortgages at 4 do you realize how stupid low that is and tenants in there   lots of tax write offs cash flow the works   it 's a 10 return if you learn about it and do it correctly or there have been a number of really great websites that were sold on that ran into five figures   you could probably pay those back in a year   but that requires some knowledge too anything worthwhile requires learning maintenance and effort you 'll have to research stocks mutual funds bonds anything if you want a better than average chance of getting worthwhile returns that is something that beats inflation which savings accounts and cds are unlikely to do   there is no magic bullet   if someone does manage to find a magic bullet what happens   everyone piles on drives the price up and the return goes down your thing might not be real estate but what is your thing   what you i.e. does n't bore you to death there are lots of investments out there but you 'll get out of it what you put into it

you 're not encouraging thought you 're patronizing me and calling the ideology i have chosen anti human what is there to debate if you already have decided that socialism is anti human the issue here is that you do n't understand socialism while i do understand laissez faire capitalism and disregarded it as something i would stand for   there are plenty of objective conclusions drawn by marx but somehow i get the feeling you have n't actually read much of marx since you probably feel that you already know what socialism is all about anyway   let 's just both save some time and skip debating this at all because i 'm not in the mood for more patronizing

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

stock prices reflect future expectations of large groups of people and may not be directly linked to traditional valuations for a number of reasons not definitive for example a service like twitter is so popular that even though it has no significant revenue and loses money people are simply betting that it is deeply embedded enough that it will eventually find some way to make money you can also see a number of cases of ipos of various types of companies that do not even have a revenue model at all also if there is rapid sales growth in a but b sales are flat no one is likely to expect future profit growth in b such that the valuation will remain steady if sales in a are accelerating there may be anticipation that future profits will be high sometimes there are also other reasons such as if a owns valuable proprietary assets that will hold the values up however more information about these companies financials is really needed in order to understand why this would be the case

as mentioned in the comments the problem stems with converting your u.s. dollars to indian rupees so as to be able to purchase an indian fixed deposit at the time of writing this 1 u.s. dollar = 64 indian rupees consider the following economic factors both of the above factors are not definitive but are worth considering you might be what if i never intend to convert my rupees back to dollars if it is the case that money converted to rupees would stay that way that then eliminates the risk of foreign exchange losses mentioned above however you must still keep in mind that part of the reason interest rates on fixed deposits is as high in india is because inflation is high a 9 return must be looked at after adjusting for inflation inflation is somewhere between at the time of writing which then reduces your real return to about 4 pre tax

in the theater it 's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat so maximum chances are that in the theater that guy is your potential customer otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater they may charge you less that 's because of a different target audience they would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets so very few customers around will be actually potential customers to maximize their profits they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can i know this is going against the normal price elasticity of demand and supply graph but if the prices are low there will be high demand so if the is more than 1 the supplier should supply as much as they can to maximize profits its all based on the target audience that 's what i think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters

so people deposit money with you you agree to pay them fixed back and then you invest money for your own profit sounds like a bank to me   or a dividend paying mutual fund or a number of other similar ideas   sure you 're welcome to start something like that up it 's unlikely you 'd get money from people unless you had already proved yourself competent as an investor though   after all if it 's possible to get a safe comfortable 5 why would anyone give you money at 2 or 3 instead of just getting that 5 for themselves   or more likely finding a competitor who gives 4.9 as in most things the market will find inefficiencies like this and squash them like bugs    that said there are some opportunities that take advantage of other kinds of situations   the most common i 'd say is owning a home   you take out a mortgage for 80 of the value of the home instead of buying it outright and you instead invest the 80 in the market   you likely will beat your mortgage rate given the current rates   that 's effectively doing the same thing with an expense you 'd have anyway you always have to live somewhere since it 's a secured loan you get better rates than the market will give as it 's quite safe and you can use tax laws in your favor mortgage interest deduction in particular and the capital gains break on primary residences

my general rule of thumb with start ups is do n't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job if you were a single man or your wife also could provide income for the family then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider i suggest a more cautious route it may be frustrating to deal with the of work but if you really want to see that start up i would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start up full time it will be a lot of work so would a start up but it is less risky especially considering your family situation if you really hate what you are doing i would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work maybe there is something that you have overlooked and do n't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified as long as it does n't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing

1 for fha loans pmi is required for where there is not at least 20 equity   bank financed non fha loans may have other standards if you are getting an fha loan if possible put down 20   so that you do not have to pay pmi   that said your pmi costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the pmi covers the difference between your equity value based on the appraisal at time of purchase and 20 equity value of the home so if you buy a home for 100 appraisal price 20 equity would be 85k   so if you put 10 down you would be paying pmi until you accrue an addition in equity   and you will be paying pmi on that for about 12 on 30 year mortgage or until you home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20 equity   there are ways to get out of pmi early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you pay more closing costs 2 different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points   we paid $ 300 for a 1.5 reduction in our interest rate less than 1 but it was called a point we were offered a few other points .25 for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for but declined but they may make more sense on a home than our more modest one   you can talk to a banker about this now get helps with getting offers accepted sometimes and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you   this meeting should be would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong and help answer your questions more than anyone here can    3 the costs will come out of your down payment   so if you put down down your costs will come out of that   so you will probably end up with being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs   you can tell the banker you want to put 10 towards the price and the banker will give you a down payment probably around 50k to cover costs etc   my figures are hopefully intentionally high better to find out that it will cost less than my than get your hopes up just to find out the costs are higher than expected

it 's likely impossible to determine why premiums are increasing in a meaningful way not only is the between the various data points very complex but some of the increases are likely due to decisions by people who do not and will not publicly post what they decided and why however it is possible to compare health insurance premium increases over time to see if the increases in employer sponsored health insurance premiums are comparable or not to the pre aca timeframe since the aca phased in over a few years we can compare the period 2008 2010 pre aca and 2013 2015 post aca ignoring 2011 2012 as being affected by the aca phase in   for this i will look at single coverage premiums only for the purpose of simplifying the analysis i found a good table of 2008 2010 premiums from the they list the following kaiser had a good list for 2013 2015 here from 2008 2010 the average growth was around 6 per year   from 2013 2015 the growth averaged about 3   in both of these cases we are comparing total premiums sum of employer and employee contributions so from a data driven look it seems that the premium growth is lower post aca than pre aca so it 's unlikely that the aca could be accused of causing increased premium growth   of course this is us wide average and on a state by state basis there may well be significant differences that may or may not be related to the aca one thing that is covered on the page linked above that is interesting while the premium growth has slowed significantly about 50 of the growth pre aca health insurance premiums are a higher proportion of employee 's wages and that growth is continuing because wage growth has not kept pace with inflation recession   employee contributions also may be higher post recession many companies reduced their contribution percentage as my then employer did for example    finally increases in the aca plans are also commonly overstated   they largely are in line with employer plans or even less    in 2015 premiums were basically flat decreasing slightly in fact see the analysis here   2016 saw a 3.6 by this methodology see the 2016 analysis    it 's very easy to examples that are favorable to any interpretation from the data though there are such big swings as a result of the different conditions in the marketplaces that it 's easy to pick a few that have high swings and claim the aca has massive premium increases or pick a few that have low swings and claim it 's reducing costs

the answer is mathematics let 's say you have $ 100 capital to invest with with a mortgage with a unit trust assuming you do n't put in borrowed money 5 growth on the property is $ 25 but a $ 25 profit on a unit trust requires 25 growth well that 's assuming zero interest and zero fees let 's say interest is 3 but so are trust fees a property now requires 8 growth for $ 25 profit in a year where a unit trust now requires 29 growth for $ 25 profit which one is more likely the above calculations do n't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables debt is n't a bad thing so do n't be afraid of using debt with debt you can borrow more to invest having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where if the math makes sense

the simple answer for the so called rule of x would be found by in your case update   if you want an approximation closer to the nominal rule of 72 value use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log the rule of 72 fits this for an interest rate of for a growth multiple of 2 the rule of 72 comes from by the natural as such the 2 is the multiple of growth the rate r here is not in percent so to change to percent say r you have to multiply by 100 the number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates   if you need more you can find all this on wikipedia

agreed that luck is important but in everything i 've read about the extremely successful it seems that careful measured analysis played just as crucial a role in their success something that these guys appear to be advising startups to ignore    but again maybe pure instinct is the only way to run the fast paced type of business they 're operating also that quote i cited may have just been an off the cuff remark not meant to be taken literally

private equity is not entirely comprised of however i understand what you 're looking for and i suggest you take some time to read this article   note the people who sit in offices and crunch numbers or figure out how to structure deals are generally the middle or lower level staff of a firm   at the top of a firm you generally have people who decide what the fund should be invested in and what strategy they should use   pe is a business and you should think of it that way   so if it were your business you 'd naturally hire really smart guys to crunch numbers or come up with solutions   then you look at these outputs and choose one to go with   such is how an efficient pe firm runs

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

an important risk is that the government may decide to change the rules for example prior to 2011 over the counter drugs like aspirin tylenol etc were eligible expenses you could use your hsa money to buy as much as you wanted beginning in 2011 those rules changed now if you want to spend your hsa money on tylenol you need a prescription for it the value of hsa dollars was diminished in the sense that the universe of eligible expenses was diminished no one knows what the hsa rules will be in the future what will be eligible expenses who will be eligible providers what kind of compliance paperwork will be required what kind of fees will be imposed personally i 'm a great believer in hsas i 've saved in one for years but remember that the government makes the rules regarding their use they 've changed the rules to the detriment of hsa owners at least once i wo n't be surprised if it continues

credit in general having no significant change between an income level or net worth is due to the economic reciprocity principle inherent in many societies although some areas of credit may be more admirable to those who are n't as well off such as car loans the overall understanding of credit is a trust agreement between someone getting something e.g. credit card user and someone giving something e.g. bank or company credit does n't have to mean just money it can be anything of value including tangible materials services etc the fact is that a credit is a common element in most economical systems and as such its use is not really variable between income levels etc sure there is variance in things like credit line amounts and rewards but the overall gist is the same for everyone borrowing paying back benefits etc all of these exchanges form the same understanding we all know and follow credit brings along with it trust the form represented in a score while not everyone may depend entirely on credit and no one should use credit as a means of getting by entirely money everyone can understand and reap the benefits of a system whether they make 10 k a year of 10 m a year this is the general idea behind credit in the broadest sense possible besides just because one has or makes more money does n't mean they do n't prefer to get good deals nobody should like being taken advantage of and if credit can help anyone can establish trust

the yield on treasury bond indicates the amount of money anyone at can make at virtually zero risk    so lets say banks have x say 100 amount of money they can either invest this in treasury bonds and get y% say 1 interest that is very safe or invest into mortgage loans i.e. lend it to people at say at 3 the extra is to cover the servicing cost and the associated risk put another way if you wanted only y% why not invest into treasury bonds rather than take the risk and hassle of getting the same y% by lending to individuals in short treasury bond rates drive the rate at which banks can invest surplus money in the market or borrow from the market this indirectly translates into the savings lending rates to the banks customers

this is a great idea and i ca n't think of any downside the best part about it is in the future when you have built up your emergency fund beyond the maximum contributions to the roth ira you can then move your roth funds into a higher yielding investment i might take it a step further in addition to this try to get a line of credit from your bank with no annual fee in case of emergency you can decide if you want to take the money from your roth or borrow from the line and pay some interest temporarily depending on the situation it may actually make sense to pay a little bit of interest and leave the money in the roth since over the long run the future earnings of that money could easily make you more than the interest you 'll pay for let 's hope a short amount of time to really hit home why your idea is fantastic

i strongly suggest you read up the option greeks you can be right about a stocks price movement and still not make money b c other factors come into play from time or volatility for a free option hedge you can look at collars buying puts and selling calls to offset the debit you pay for the transaction ex aapl is 115 you buy the 110 puts and sell the 120 calls this gives you a collar around he current price your hedged below 110 and can still participate in upside move to 120 also look into time value time decays exponentially in the last 30 days if you are long this hurts you if you are this is good be sure to take this into account delta relation of the option to the underlying stock move on a .01 1 scale .50 is normal deep in the money options have higher deltas it is possible other factors can offset this delta move this is why people will lose money on earnings plays even though they are right   ex say you buy an aapl call at 120 earnings comes out and the stock goes to 121 even though you are in the money your contract may still have less value than what you paid because of volatility collapse the market place knows earnings move a stock and that is factored into the price of the options expected volatility as mentioned watch out for dividend dates always be aware of dividend dates and earnings dates and if your contract is going to cover one of these events interest rates have an effect as well but since the fed has near 0 rates there is little impact at the present though this could certainly change if the fed starts raising rates research the black scholes pricing model whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game as far as choosing strikes you can look at calculating the at the money straddle to see if the options are cheap stock price implied volatility for 30 60 90 days depending on your holding period sq root of days to expiration 19 which is sq root of days yr add and subtract this number to the current stock price to give you an approximate 1 standard deviation of expected price movement keeping with our example aapl at 115 lets say your formula spits out a 6 therefore price range is expected to be 109 to 121 for the time period helpful for selling options i would sell the   call or the 108 puts hope this helps start small and get a feel for things

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

yes   i 've spoken to mortgage officers from various banks who will do conventional loans with anything as low as 3.5 down however there are many more restrictions e.g. normally you can borrow funds from a parent or relative for a down payment in this case that was prohibited if you are already pre approved then your approval letter should state the specifics you need to adhere to   if you would like to modify that e.g. put a smaller amount down then you could still get the loan but your pre approval wo n't be valid i would recommend speaking with your lender and perhaps with a few others as well about the new home you are looking at

no needed   the want to pretend this whole process is complicated so people like you do n't ask questions but that 's really it   there 's nothing more to it than that   they purchase bonds and other financial assets from the government and from their favorite banker friends with the money they just created presumably by pushing the up arrow on a dell keyboard lol   that 's it   then the major banks and the government all have more money   the idea being that it up credit   those banks will lend out more money to other banks and eventually to us   additionally the government will have more money to spend   it gives the illusion that something of worth was actually created   that 's the entire scheme   you still may have $ 1000 dollars but your $ 1000 is now a smaller percentage of the total amount of money out there so it buys less as prices increase to adjust for this new money

there are classes of traders who close their positions out every evening not just on fridays   but their are other types of businesses who trade shortly before or nearly right at market close with both buys and sells   there are lots of theories as to how the market behaves at various times of day days of the week months of the year   there are some few patterns that can emerge but in general they do n't provide a lot of lift above pure random chance enough so that if you bet on one of these your chances of being wrong are only very slightly different from being right enough so that it 's not really fair to call any of them a sure thing   and since these events are often fairly widely spaced it 's difficult to play them often enough to get the law of large numbers on your side as opposed to say card counting at a blackjack table which basically makes betting on them not much different from gambling

thanks /u great information do you have any terms   or on investopedia or can recommend i search for how much debt is ideal to take on for a start up   i 'd like to learn more instead of getting you to do my homework if that makes sense   my simulation is similar to we 've made two strategic decisions 1 we went capital intensive in the first year to build up factory capacity year 1 we have very little r&amp;d but year 2 we plan to increase r&amp;d budget    since it is a capital intensive year should that capital expenditure be funded by debt entirely and i leave equity alone i noticed this drives down my wacc but i see a decrease in npv because of increased interest payments also does it make sense to increase the debt to pay for r&amp;d as well the way i see it paying for the manufacturing plant on debt is n't bad because you get an asset out of it at the end but paying for a r&amp;d program seems foolish because in this simulation there 's a chance your r&amp;d program fails and does not provide results so we would   see no return on the debt in that case    thanks again

dividends are normally paid in cash so do n't generally affect your portfolio aside from a slight increase to cash   you get a check for them or your broker would deposit the funds into a money market account for you   there is sometimes an option to re invest dividends see 's answer regarding dividend re investment plans as tom au described the dividends are set by the board of directors and announced   also as he indicated just before the record date a stock which pays dividends is worth slightly more reflecting the value of the dividend that will be paid to anyone holding the stock on the record date and goes down by the dividend amount immediately after that date since you 'd now have to hold the stock till the next record date to get a dividend   in general unless there 's a big change in the landscape such as in late 2008 most companies pay out about the same dividend each time and changes to this are sometimes seen by some as indicators of company health and such news can result in movement in the stock price when you look at a basic quote on a ticker symbol there is usually a line for div yeild which gives the amount of dividend paid per share and the relative yeild as a percentage of the stock price   if a company has been paying dividends this field will have values in it if a company does not pay a dividend it will be blank or say na depending on where you get the quote   this is the easiest way to see if a company pays a dividend or not   for example if you look at this quote for google you can see it pays no dividend   now in terms of telling when and how much of a dividend has been paid most financial sites have the option when viewing a stock chart to show the dividend payments   if you expand the chart to show at least a year you can see when and how much was paid in terms of dividends   for example you can see from this chart that msft pays dividends once a quarter and used to pay out 13 cents but recently changed to 16 cents    if you were to float your mouse over one of those icons it would also give the date the dividend was paid

if you want to retire in 7 years at age 35 and only currently have 150k and you need to ask this question of how to invest your money risk free then you will not be retiring at age 35 nor buying your house   it is possible to do but not risk free in fact you will need to take quite a bit of risk but you would need to have a detailed plan about how you would go about to achieve this goal what assets you would be investing in and what risk management you would have in place if you have to ask this question all you have is a goal but no plan you probably will need to do plenty of research in the types of investment you prefer and develop a plan to take you to your destination this could take you a year or 10 years depending on how motivated you are in your goals

i 'm going to assume that you want to be invested all the time and each trade consists in selling a security and buying another one similar to your example how much commissions you are willing to pay depends on several factors but one way to think about it is as follows you have a position in stock a and you want to switch to stock b because you think it will perform better if you think there 's a good chance > 50 that b will outperform a by more than x% then you can happily pay up to commissions and still make money over a long time horizon if you like formulae one way to express it is where example if you tend to be right 51 of the time hit rate and gain 110 more than you lose on average win loss ratio you can see that your expected profit is 5.1 commissions so you could pay 2.5 commissions on entering and closing the position and still make money*. unfortunately common sense statistics and numerous studies tell us a sad truth on average people have a hit rate of 50 and a win loss ratio of 100 which means that their expected profit per trade is 0 commission based on that crude observation unless you can prove to yourself that you are better than average you should aim at reducing commissions paid to your broker as much as possible through 51 and 110 are not random numbers they correspond to the results of the top 15 professional managers in a research paper using a sample of funds managing $

either way lease or buy it 's likely going to be an expense not a depreciation you would expense the entire lease amount whatever that is in the year it was paid a $ computer probably is n't worth the trouble of recording it as a fixed asset and depreciating it yearly i work for a company that buys thousands of pcs a year for its employees and we have a hard rule if it 's under $ 3k it 's an expense not an asset if you were buying $ servers this would be a different conversation both because of the price and the life of the item because it 's such a small amount unless you really are buying $ 20k pcs it does n't really matter whether it 's your biggest expense or not it 's likely just an expense though no one is preventing you from depreciating it over 5 years if you wanted to see in summary i would say your question is more of a business sense question than a tax question is it worth it to you to lease instead of buying because you are getting a new pc so often btw every 2 years is not that often it 's average whatever your decision i think the answer for taxes is the same expense it all in the year it was incurred unless you really want to spread it out and depreciate

the advantage of an ira or 401k is you get taxed effectively one time on your income whereas you get taxed effectively multiple times on some of the money in a taxable account you have to consider it from the perspective of time value of money the concept that an amount of money now is the same value as a greater amount of money in the future and in fact if you put your money in an investment the principal at the start can be considered the same value as the principal + earnings at the end in both traditional and roth ira you pay taxes on the entire value of money once remember that the principal when depositing is the same value as the principal + earnings when withdrawing the only difference is when year deposited or year withdrawn so the main difference between the two is the tax rate when depositing vs. tax rate when withdrawing i 'll give you an example to demonstrate we will assume you invest $ 1000 of pre tax wages it grows at 5 per year there 's a 25 flat tax now and in the future you withdraw it after 20 years and withdrawals are not subject to any penalty

the system of comparison and calculation of insurance rates seems completely and utterly flawed to me why would you group cars from different manufacturers together by arbitrarily defined factors such as weight and size it is perfectly possible to have a big heavy car with very low claims while a small car can have a lot more claims    the response provided by tesla seems similarly moronic they claim that their car is being compared to the wrong types of car but even if that were the case so what if the other cars you are being compared to are too cheap slow small then you have obviously been assigned to the wrong group and should be in another group with the bigger more expensive cars which i would gather are even more expensive to insure and thus your car should be more expensive to insure    if an insurance company is providing insurance to 1000 volvo 90 drivers and 1000 tesla model s drivers and they get 100 claims from the volvo drivers costing them a total of $ 200,000 while they get 150 claims from the tesla drivers totaling $ 300,000 during the same time period obviously the tesla should be 50 more expensive to insure that is literally how car insurance works    here in germany every model of car is assigned a unique identifier roughly translates as type number or type identifier insurance companies track which cars their clients own and report condensed claims statistics for each model back to a central service provider which then assigns an insurance group to each car for each type of insurance there are distinct independent groups for liability partial and comprehensive coverage depending on the actual measured per car expenditures experienced by the insurance companies over the previous year the insurance companies then feed that data back into their systems for their rate calculations

if it is true that for the same price you could get a better place or that for a lower price you could get an equivalent place you should do some soul searching to decide what monetary value you would place on the hassle of moving to such an alternative   you should then negotiate aggressively for a rent that is no more than the rent of the alternative place plus your hassle costs and if the landlord does not meet your price you should refuse to renew your lease and instead move out to an alternative   of course you might also want to double check your research to ensure you really can get such a good alternative and that your new landlords wo n't try a similar bait and switch and force you to move again in a year barring local ordinances such as rent control laws i do n't think it 's worth it to worry about whether the increase is normal   if you can get a better deal somewhere else then what your landlords are asking is too much   if you have a good relationship with them on a personal level you may be able to tell them this in a nice way and thus get them to make a more reasonable offer   otherwise the landlords will learn that their expectations are unreasonable when all their tenants move out to cheaper places

cash has zero value until it is transformed into something material    cash hoarders realize no improvement in their lifestyle by gaining more cash than they need    if corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market why would further tax breaks improve anything    an inflated stock market only improves income for very few    people who need money will spend it and put it back into circulation    people will not hoard cash if they know more will show up regardless of their ability to perform    less financial pressure and less resentment of the rich for their preferential treatment would create a more positive attitude among the population and improve productivity    a happier work force is a more productive work force    people should only work part time anyway so they can have a life outside of work to enjoy their lives while they have the health to do it    your life away until you ca n't do the things you always wanted to do does not improve a person 's outlook    life according to me    was a reduction in unemployment compensation medicare and snap payments included in the study    there may be a reduction in spending on crime and addiction as well

i agree the cfa is nice for students who have the time to take the exam because it could be a year or two before the start working so it is a reasonable resume especially if your major is engineer science or math and you want to do finance   if you are trying to do a career change it is important to know the material because if you do n't then you ca n't do the job even if someone gives it to you but passing the test is n't as important as actually applying to the jobs and networking   i switched from engineering to finance buyside equity analyst originally i planned to take the cfa exams to help me with my transition but their new rule required a valid passport and it takes a while to get one so i missed the deadline for last december 's exam that turned out to be a good thing because i just started networking cold calling emailing applying to jobs etc and i got my current job if i had actually decided to take the cfa i would have wasted all my time preparing for the exam instead of trying to get the job potential employers know if you are good or not after talking to you for 15 minutes it has nothing to do with being able to memorize a set of formulas some the last name of some economists and their theories some accounting differences between gaap and etc for me it was the fact that i invest my own money and that i am able to explain my own investments very intelligently aka it needs to be a lot better than what you see on /r investing   if you know nothing about finance studying the cfa material and then taking the exam is a good thing you are going to be studying the material anyways if you are serious about a career change so might as well take the exam afterwards and get a resume i did end up taking the level 1 this month because my new employer paid for it i do n't think it adds any value once your foot is already in the door especially since it takes 5 years of experience to get the charter after that amount of time it 's all about job experience

back in the late 80 's i had a co worked do exactly this in those days you could only do things quarterly change the percentage change the investment mix make a withdrawal there were no roth 401 k accounts but contributions could be pre tax or post tax long term employees were matched 100 up to 8 newer employees were only matched 50 up to 8 resulting in 4 match every quarter this employee put in 8 and then pulled out the previous quarters contribution the company match continued to grow   was it smart he still ended up with 8 going into the 401k. in those pre enron days the law allowed companies to limit the company match to 100 company stock which meant that employees retirement was at risk of course by the early 2000 's the stock that was purchased for $ 6 a share was worth $ 80 a share now what about the irs since i make designated roth contributions from after tax income can i make tax free withdrawals from my designated roth account at any    time no the same restrictions on withdrawals that apply to pre tax    elective contributions also apply to designated roth contributions if    your plan permits distributions from accounts because of hardship you    may choose to receive a hardship distribution from your designated    roth account the hardship distribution will consist of a pro rata    share of earnings and basis and the earnings portion will be included    in gross income unless you have had the designated roth account for 5    years and are either disabled or over age 59 regarding getting just contributions what happens if i take a distribution from my designated roth account before the end of the year period if you take a distribution from your designated roth account before    the end of the year period it is a nonqualified    distribution you must include the earnings portion of the    nonqualified distribution in gross income however the basis or    contributions portion of the nonqualified distribution is not    included in gross income the basis portion of the distribution is    determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution    by the ratio of designated roth contributions to the total designated    roth account balance for example if a nonqualified distribution of    $ 5,000 is made from your designated roth account when the account    consists of $ of designated roth contributions and $ 600 of    earnings the distribution consists of $ of designated roth    contributions that are not includible in your gross income and $ 300    of earnings that are includible in your gross income see regarding rollovers of designated roth contributions for    additional rules for rolling over both qualified and nonqualified    distributions from designated roth accounts

i 'm guessing since i do n't know the term but it sounds like you 're asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single up front transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though you 're giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanity check it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a payments processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need   i 've done this in my case it cost me a bit under $ 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers family loan   will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and ca n't do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni

if you do n't have a good knowledge of finance maybe you should not put too much money in individual stocks but if you really want to invest you can just compare the rate of return of the most known stocks available to you like the one from the s&p for the us the rate of return is very simple to compute it 's share price for example a company with a current share price of usd that delivered a dividend of usd last year would have a rate of return of 100 now if you only invest in the most known stocks since they are already covered by nearly all financial institutions and analysts if you are looking for lower risk dividend companies take a sample of companies and invest those with the lowest rates of return but avoid extreme values of course since the stock prices are changing all the time you have to compare them with a price taken at the same time like the closing price of a specific day and for the dividend they can be on several basis yearly etc so you have to be sure to take the same basis you can also find the p e ratio which is the opposite indicator (= share price dividend so an higher p e ratio means a lower risk most of the time you can find the p e ratio or the rate of return already computed on specialized website or brokers

a derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind the kind whose price depends on or is derived from another asset   this definition is from john hull options futures and other derivatives a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this you can easily find old copies for a few dollars the first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument like credits or insurances the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else the mentioned asset in most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset in the i give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to   and first let me point out that the definition is marginally wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets nor do they have a price like temperature sunlight or even your own life in the case of mortgages   but before going in this list let me go through the remaining points of your question what is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative as already noted in most cases a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort   in a classical insurance contract one party of the contract is an insurance company but in the broader case of a derivative that counterparty can be pretty anything an insurance a bank a government a large company and most probably market makers how is it really used and how does this deviate from the first point briefly how does is it affecting people and how is it causing problems an important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices   actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives is that they are products whose price y is a measurable function of one or several random variables on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price y of the asset this is what the depends on means in technical terms   in the most favorable case we obtain an easy formula linking y to the which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument but in practice it can be very difficult if at all possible to determine a price for derivatives this has two implications persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market in comparison to less advanced actors on the market organisation owning assets they can not price can not compute their anymore so that they can not know for sure their financial situation they are somehow playing roulette but wait if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation how is this not a contradiction some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons   for instance many in france and germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part like in a classical credit and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit   so for a 25 years running credit of type the price y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 which are the uncertain prices for the swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years   some of these can be quite small with inhabitants and needless to say do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments which in that special case led the court call the credit a and to cancel the credit   but what chain of events leads a inhabitants city in france to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the swiss frank   after the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of lehman brothers in 2008 it has begun to be very hard to organise funding which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money   so the municipality needs a 25 years credit of euros and goes to its communal bank   the communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing   so the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the swiss frank will have in the 25 next years since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit   since the small bank has no idea how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various it works with   if we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank we could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their and we could also ask if they are so that they eventually can manipulate the swiss frank to secure an even higher profit   but i will not go into this   to the best of my understanding the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot with different actors but i know this latter subject only by what i could read in french newspapers so much for the how is it causing problems part what is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives and    there meanings of course answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by hull along with deriving some important mathematical principles   and i will not copy these seven chapters here how would someone get started dealing in derivatives i 'm playing a      realistic stock market simulation so it does n't matter if your      answer to this costs me money if you ask the question i understand that you are not a professional so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play i outlined above i would not doing this   that said if you have a good mathematical background and can program well once you are with the books of hull and you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies once you are confident with this you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on and once you are done with this you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles and yes even for the simplest options they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better indeed i 've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money you know your weapons two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant   this is a classical future contract it can be modified in every imaginable way usually by options   for instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party   the price is written today as part of the contract   there is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something   unlike the future contract only one party can be obliged to do something the other a right but no obligation if you buy and option your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset this is the most familiar to anybody   credits can come in many different especially the formula to compute interests or also embed options   common options are early settlement options or options while this is not completely the credit works like an insurance   this is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money that speculates that the ratio of going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit this is like a mortgage on a financial institution   two parties agree that one will an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults here this is an explicit insurance against the event where a goes bankrupt one finds here more or less standard options on electricity but electricity have delicious as it can practically not be stored and fallout is also usually avoided as for classical options these are insurances against price moves a swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas typical example are fixed rate vs. on some given maturity which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives   the off the counter market features very very insurance products the most basic form is the insurance against drought but you can image different dangers and once you have it you can put it in options in a swap etc   for instance a restaurant with a could enter in a weather insurance paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year actually this list is virtually without limits

how does finra 's 5 markup policy   affect the expense profit value of an etf mutual fund   an extreme example to illustrate if my fund buys 100 ibm 100 the fund would credit the broker $ 10,000 for those shares and the broker would give the fund 100 shares additionally there would be some sort of commission say $ 10 paid on top of the transaction which would come out of the fund 's expense ratio   but the broker is allowed to charge a 5 markup so that means that $ 100 price that i see could have hit the tape at $ 95 assume 5 markup which is allowed thus assuming that the day had zero volatility for ibm   when the fund gets priced at the end of the day my 100 shares which cost 10,000 plus $ 10 now has a market value of $ 9,500 is that how it could work that 500 is n't calculated as part of the expense of the fund is it how could it be they do n't know about the exact value of the markup

assuming you plan to buy a whole number of shares and have a maximum dollar value you intend to invest it may be better to wait for the split if the figures do n't quite work out nicely for example if you are going to invest $ 1,000 and the stock pre split is $ 400 and the split is 2 for 1 then you 'd buy 2 shares before the split unless you have an extra $ 200 to add meanwhile after the split you could buy 5 shares at $ 200 so that you invest all that you intend aside from that case it does n't really make a difference since the split is similar to getting 2 nickels for a dime which in each case is still a total value of 10 cents

that $ 200 extra that your employer withheld may already have been sent on to the irs depending on the size of the employer withholdings from payroll taxes plus employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes might be deposited in the us treasury within days of being withheld so asking the employer to reimburse you out of petty cash so to speak might not work at all   as joetaxpayer says you could ask that $ 200 less be withheld as income tax from your pay for the next pay period is your federal income tax withholding at least $ 200 per pay period and one way of forcing the employer to withhold less is to file a   new w-4 form with human resources payroll increasing the number of   exemptions to more than you are entitled to and then filing a new w-4 changing your exemptions back to what they are right now once when you have had $ 200 less withheld but be careful claims for more exemptions than you are entitled to can be problematic and the irs might come looking if you suddenly discover several extra children for whom you are entitled to claim exemptions

perhaps where we are losing touch is in how income inequality is being measured what i 'm saying is how much more wealthy the top 10 is than the bottom 10 in real numbers not by ratio the united states and other modern democracies with free markets absolutely these smaller less free nations although places like south africa and have gigantic inequality by ratio that primarily because the poor are so poor in those nations   for instance if one man makes $ 100 a year and another makes $ 100,000 the difference is $ in real numbers but 1000 times as much however if a man makes $ 10,000 a year where another makes $ 1,000,000 it is only 100 times as much but the real number difference is $ although by ratio the poorer nation has greater income inequality the wealthier nation has a far greater real gap between the upper and lower class measuring income inequalities both ways has it 's purpose but to judge by only the ratio often gives false impressions often the false impressions given are intentional as in the case of the un which has a markedly anti capitalism lean in its bureaucratic membership   try my original statement with how i am measuring income inequality in mind

no you will not have to pay taxes on the corpus principal of the trust distribution   if the trust tax forms were filed correctly you might have as much as a $ 9000 loss that will flow to you on the trust 's termination   previously the trust was supposed to file a return each year and either claim the dividends or realized cap gains each year and pay taxes at trust 's rate or distribute them to the beneficiaries via k-1 form this is the best way to handle this as the trust has a steep tax table relative high rates vs the kiddie tax which would let you get nearly $ 1k yr tax free each year as a minor   during that time losses net again gains but ca n't be distributed to the beneficiary they are carried forward year to year in the year the trust is terminated that loss is not lost but it 's then passed on to the beneficiary still via k-1 see schedule k-1 instructions and schedule k-1 itself   on a lighter note the trustee failed you in the 16 years jan 2015 the market s&p grew by 88 with a compound return instead of any gain you got a loss with a return if this were a paid professional you 'd have a potential claim for a lawsuit this is a reason why amateurs should not be assigned the role of trustee   to clearly answer the mix of questions you asked note it 's always a good idea to seek professional advice but the nature of this board is that if any of my answer is n't accurate a high ranked member top 20 or so on this list will likely set me straight within 24 hours

retail purchases are purchases made at retail i.e. as a consumer individual customer that would include any standard individual expenditure but may exclude wholesale sales or purchases from merchants who identify themselves as service providers to businesses specifics of these limitations really depend on your card issuer and you should inquire with the customer service at what are their specific eligibility requirements as an example here in the us many cards give high cash back for gasoline purchases but only at retail locations that excludes wholesale club sellers like costco for example

reading stuff like this makes me want to go into the debt collection business just send letters to random people demanding money sounds like an easy way to make a living what 's your name and address just kidding if they are sending stuff to a virginia po box close the box with no forwarding address and consider it case closed if they are you personally in new hampshire the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection new hampshire has strict anti debt collection laws basically what you do is go to small claims court and fill out a one page form sue them for $ 2000 $ 3000 or whatever is convenient do not hire a lawyer you can do this in 2 hours of your own time your grounds are 1 violation of the creditor of nh laws according to the laws the creditor has to put all kinds of specific stuff in their threat letters since they are not doing this they have violated nh read the so you know which specific items they are violating 2 extortion since you do not owe them any money demanding money from you is extortion which is both criminally and actionable you sue them for mental anguish due to extortion   the validity of your claims is irrelevant you just need to get them in court there are two possibilities a they fail to show up in this case you win and they owe you $ 3000 or whatever not only that if they later try to collect from you send a copy of the judgement to the credit bureau or collector or whatever and that is proof you owe them no money b they hire some local lawyer who appears accept the court 's offer for arbitration when you go into arbitration with the lawyer tell him you will drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $ 500 and a hand written guarantee from him that you will never hear from his client again either way you come out ahead by the way it is absolutely guaranteed that the enemy lawyer will accept your offer in b above because the seo company is already paying him $ 5000 to show up to answer your lawsuit and the lawyer does not want to hang around all morning in court waiting for the case to be heard if he can get out of there in half an hour for only $ 500 he will do it if all you are getting is calls and the caller refuses to identify then it is definitely an illegal scam it is illegal in new hampshire to make collection calls and refuse to full identify who is calling the phone company has methods for dealing with illegal calls first you have to file a police report then you call verizon security at 1 800 or whatever your phone company is they will trace the call and identify the caller they you can make a criminal complaint in their jurisdiction unless the call is from pakistan or something

coins are legal tender they 're authorized by governments and have a face value rounds are simply coined pieces of metal minted by private manufacturers they do not have any face value and are not legal tender rounds are used to own metal they have no value other than the value of the metal in them any premium you pay over the price of the metal is the mint 's profit coins are also used as i.e. to own metal and create profits for the government but many times coins have limited issue and become valuable because of the rarity specific issues with a specific coin mistakes impurities exclusive designs etc so they also may have some value depends on the specific coin coins also have the assurance of quality of the authorizing government and are dealt with by the law as forgery of coins is illegal and is a crime rounds however do not enjoy such protection and any one can mint them only copyright trademark protections apply where the enforcement is by the owner and not the government re the advantages coins if you pick the right ones appreciate much more than the metal however this is mostly in hindsight and most of the coins do not appreciate significantly beyond the price of the metal unless there 's something else significant about them first year of issue high quality certification etc rounds on the other hand are cheaper 1 oz round will be significantly cheaper than 1 oz coin and monitor more closely the price of the metal it is unlikely for rounds to significantly deviate from the spot price although this does happen occasionally for specific designs or if a mint goes out of business

as a lefty mixed emotions i guess on the one hand i think the criminal justice system is far more harsh on minor crime like some poor guy stealing $ 500 than crime that really impacts a lot of people and involves much larger sums for a variety of reasons so it 's sort of interesting to see a white collar criminal actually being taken seriously for once   on the other hand i 'm not a fan of the united states 's ridiculous obsession with people for long periods of time in some other countries sentences do n't even in most of scandinavia 15-year sentences are the maximum for any crime with a very rarely exception that allows the police to petition for someone 's release to be delayed if they would pose an imminent threat of violence upon release so in general i 'm against locking lots of people up just as revenge as opposed to because they would pose a real threat if they were not locked up i would also prefer to look first for alternative arrangements such as house arrest and monitoring and reserve prison only for really dangerous people where there is absolutely no possible alternative i 'm not sure stanford really counts in that category   so it basically boils down to by the standards of american criminal justice white collar crime is greatly under prosecuted relative to other crime but the standards of american criminal justice are bullshit and i 'm not sure locking up a bunch of white collar criminals is a good way to make up for the fact that we lock up too many petty criminals or even people doing things that should n't be crimes at all   the other somewhat different issue is that i think we need to go after systemic problems more than random individuals the system of finance is the real problem

a yes it does accomplish the goal of adding more money but the money is in lieu of any return you can earn while the loan is outstanding if you somehow knew exactly which periods where going to run negative and you took a 401k loan during that time you 'd be in pretty good shape but if you had that information you 'd probably be ruling the world in short order and would n't care much about a measly 401k b it 's a nice idea but unfortunately you are not allowed to set your own interest rate if you could your idea would work perfectly the interest rate is bank specific and is typically 1 2 points over prime but if your plan was to leave your money sitting in cash or low interest bearing accounts anyway the loan does actually achieve the goal of getting more money in there though it 's your money you are n't earning it

it also depends on where you work if you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date all income before that date is considered income for state 1 and all income on or after that date is income for state 2   if there is a big   difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet if they had the same rates moving would n't impact your wallet but it would impact each state so make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles register to vote get a new drivers license it becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job in that case where you work might be the deciding factor same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor in other cases it is not for virginia maryland and dc you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are dc md va but if you live in delaware and work in virginia virginia wants a cut of your income tax   so before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states from massachusetts information for nonresident and part year resident income exemptions deductions and credits massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from    sources within massachusetts this includes income a few questions later massachusetts residents and part year residents are allowed a credit    for taxes due to any other jurisdiction the credit is available only    on income reported and taxed on a massachusetts return nonresidents    may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their    massachusetts form the credit is allowed for income taxes paid to the credit is not allowed for taxes paid to the u.s. government or a    foreign country other than canada city or local tax and interest and    penalty paid to another jurisdiction the computation is based on comparing the massachusetts income tax on    income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to    the other jurisdiction the credit is limited to the smaller of these    two numbers the other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you    must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also    enter the credit information on the schedule so if you move your house to new hampshire but continue to work in massachusetts you will owe income tax to massachusetts   for that income even after you move and establish residency in new hampshire

1 is this right pretty much though this is a really rudimentary way to think about it 2 if it is why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees by cutting out the government it 's the polar opposite of that google and companies like that do things like have a day care center on premises   the company staffs a day care center which has costs then lets employees use it for free   this is a business expense for google and in relative terms a considerably large business expense that a lower margin business could no afford employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code   the company portion of the healthcare costs are a deductible business expense to the company as expected   healthcare is different than most other expenses because the employee can forego income before it 's effectively received which negates it from taxable income    this does n't work for something like food purchased at a cafe on a google complex   if employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe it 's taxable income being spent though the cost of running the cafe is a tax deductible business expense to the company there have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care and no cost employee to address your new example for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ this would be an audit prone administrative nightmare   either you need john to submit receipts for reimbursement up to the $ 10,000 agreed upon amount which would require some kind of administrative staff or after a very short period of time john forgets the abstract value of the food cost arrangement that is only really benefiting the employer in the form of lower payroll expense and is away for more pay somewhere else anyway   the company may be saving $ 2,500 though again there will be an additional administrative expense of some sort but john is only saving $ 500 $ 0.20 $ 100,000 0.20

personally i would advise only buying what you can afford without borrowing money even if it means living in a tent financially that is the best move if you are determined to borrow money to buy a house the person with income should buy it as sole owner split ownership will create a nightmare if any problems develop in the relationship split ownership has the advantage that it doubles the tax free appreciation deduction from $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 but in your case my sense is that that is not a sufficient reason to risk dual ownership do not charge your partner rent that is crazy

etf creation and redemption process notes the process while etf trading occurs on an exchange like stocks the process by    which their shares are created is significantly different unless a    company decides to issue more shares the supply of shares of an    individual stock trading in the marketplace is finite when demand    increases for shares of an etf however authorized participants aps    have the ability to create additional shares on demand through an in kind transfer mechanism aps create etf units in the    primary market by delivering a basket of securities to the fund equal    to the current holdings of the etf in return they receive a large    block of etf shares typically 50,000 which are then available for    trading in the secondary market this etf creation and redemption    process helps keep etf supply and demand in continual balance and    provides a hidden layer of liquidity not evident by looking at    trading volumes alone this process also works in reverse if an investor wants to sell a    large block of shares of an etf even if there seems to be limited    liquidity in the secondary market aps can readily redeem a block of    etf shares by gathering enough shares of the etf to form a creation    unit and then exchanging the creation unit for the underlying    securities thus the in kind swap to the underlying securities is only done by aps so the outflow would be these individuals taking a large block of the etf and swapping it for the underlying securities   the aps would be taking advantage of the difference between what the etf 's trading value and the value of the underlying securities

as pointed out in their answer at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company one you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares that is you do n't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of abc you put in an order to buy 1 share of abc for $ 10 if no one is willing to sell a share of abc for $ 10 then your order will go unfilled this happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock practically speaking there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares you can put in a market order for 1 share of abc which says essentially i want one share of abc and i will pay whatever the market deems to be the price your broker will find you 1 share but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay while it 's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price this causes a market crash as in the 2007 2008 financial crisis when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held and for a few days very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price

in my experience this choice is entirely up to the bank itself there was a time when given my mothers atm card i could go to the bank and pull money for her but the bank has since changed their rules and now they only will allow people listed on the account to access it card or no card   if the bank is aware of who you are and knows that your friend is not you they may be skeptical of allowing your friend to withdraw any money or they might not care it 's at their discretion   if they do not know who either of you are if your friend has the card and information needed that will likely be sufficient unless they ask for identification

a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder that is willing to work with them if they 've held up their end of the contract to date

as is so often the case there is an next to that 2.5 interest offer   it leads you to a footnote which says savings interest rate offer of 2.5 is available between january 1 2015 and march 31 2015 on all net new deposits made between january 1 2015 and march 31 2015 to a maximum of $ per account registration you only earn 2.5 interest on deposits made during those three months   also on the full offer info page it says during the offer period the bank will calculate additional interest on eligible net new deposits and all interest payments are ineligible for the purposes of calculating additional interest and will not be calculated for the purposes of determining eligible daily balances in other words any interest paid into an applicable account including additional interest will not be treated as a new deposit for subsequently calculating additional interest payments i could n't totally parse out all the details of the offer from their legalese but what it sounds like is you will earn 2.5 interest on money that you deposit into the account during those three months   any interest you accrue during that time will not count as a deposit in this sense and so will not earn 2.5 compounded returns   the during the offer period qualification also makes it sound like this extra interest will only be paid during the three months presumably at a 2.5 annualized rate but i ca n't see where it actually says this so essentially you are getting a one time bonus for making deposits during a specific three month period   the account does n't really earn 2.5 interest in the normal sense   the long term interest rate will be what it normally is for their savings accounts which this page says is 1.05

if your financial needs are n't complex and mostly limited to portfolio management consider looking into the thing called robo advisers proper term is automated investing services   the difference is that robo advisers use software to manage portfolios on a large scale generating big economy of scale and therefore offering a much cheaper services than personal advisor would and unless your financial needs are extremely complex the state of the art of scaled up portfolio management is at the point that a human advisor really does n't give you any value add and as other answers noted human advisor can easily bring in downsides such as conflict of interest and lack of fiduciary responsibility   disclaimer i indirectly derive my living from a company which derives a very small part of their income from a robo adviser therefore there 's a possible small conflict of interest in my answer

this situation is certainly difficult to handle while there are good reasons for and against giving or loaning money directly why not handle this in an open and honest way   give your friends the link to your question which shows that you care about their well being and the friendship it also shows that you are deeply concerned that the situation might become worse if they are unable to get the finances in order   if a close friend of mine would be so concerned it would definitely get me starting to think about the situation and possible ways out of it there will be no single solution to the problems they are facing but having friends that actually care can stabilize such a tricky situation much more than any small financial gain when a friend of mine was in deep financial trouble he did not hang out with us anymore because we often met in bars or which were at that point just too expensive for him so simply changing the location to a less expensive place allowed him to participate in social life again and was much better if we would have payed for him and created an atmosphere of social debt

the buyer discloses the financing arrangements to the seller because it makes his offer more attractive when a seller receives and accepts an offer the deal does not usually close until 30 to 60 days later   if the buyer can not come up with the money by closing the deal falls apart   this is a risk for the seller when a seller is considering whether or not to accept an offer it is helpful to know the likelihood that the buyer can actually obtain the amount of cash in the offer by the closing date   if the buyer ca n't acquire the funding the offer is n't worth the paper it is printed on the amount of the down payment vs. the amount of financing is also relevant to the seller   let me give you a real world example that happened to me once when i was selling a house   the buyer was doing a no money down mortgage and had no money for a down payment   he was even borrowing the closing costs   we accepted the offer but when the bank did the appraisal it was short of the purchase price   for most home sales this would not be a problem as long as the appraisal was more than the amount borrowed   but in this case because the amount borrowed was more than the appraisal the bank had a problem   the deal was at risk and in order to continue either the buyer had to find some money somewhere which he could n't or we had to lower the price to save the deal   certainly accepting the offer from a buyer with no cash to bring to the table was a risk in our case we got lucky we found some errors that were made in the appraisal and got it

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

the short answer is you are not required to   the longer answer depends on whether you are referring to your organization as a sole proprietorship in your state or for federal taxation   for federal tax purposes i would suggest filing each side job as a separate sch c though   the irs uses the information you provide about your sole proprietorship to determine whether or not your categorization of expenses makes sense for the type of business you are   this information is used by the irs to help them determine who to audit   so if you are a service based business but you are reporting cost of goods sold you are likely to be audited

unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state to receive unemployment insurance payments you must have lost your job through no fault of your own if you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits state unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits as soon as you apply for unemployment insurance an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control after the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff your weekly payment is calculated your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job generally between 20 percent and 50 percent depending on your state unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment before you begin receiving benefits you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks if you find a new job during this period you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job after the waiting period you will begin to receive your weekly payments employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes so while employees work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits the money does not come from their pay employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors including how many former employees have received benefits employers pay taxes on an employee 's base wages which vary by state california for example taxes employers on the first $ 7,000 of an employee 's annual earnings while neighboring oregon taxes up to $ of wages employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly states have several categories of tax rates they charge employers new businesses and those first adding employees pay the new rate which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses established businesses who have n't paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the standard rate the highest possible tax rate which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including georgia hawaii and alaska to percent in pennsylvania businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the experienced rate depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment states can give sizable rate reductions the fewer claims the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes as a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend unemployment benefits   regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states however additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment the unemployment extension legislation passed by congress in february 2012 changed the way the tiers of emergency unemployment compensation are structured a tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits there are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits emergency unemployment compensation tiers june august 2012 source and further information can be found here unemployment tiers about.com sources unemployment us dept of labor how does unemployment insurance work ehow percentage of pay that goes to unemployment insurance ehow additional info you can file for ui over the internet here are some useful resources ows links state unemployment offices about.com how to apply for unemployment over the internet ehow

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

tl;dr unfortunately there is little available to the retail investor that fits your description institutional investors can use swaps to gain leverage on the above trade   a bank will build a basket of long msft and short spy and then quote a rate against libor london interbank offered rate and a margin requirement   so at the end of the swap the bank will pay the difference in total return between msft and spy and the investor will pay some amount of cash back   the nice thing for the investor is that the margin requirement will often be fairly small if their credit is good so the investor can lever the trade up significantly a retail investor could call up your broker and try to get the above but on the off chance they let you the margin requirement might be higher than just going short the spy if you are n't a retail investor you might be able to do something like be long a 3x tech etf and short 3x spy etf   if you are very clever you might be able to combine multiple levered tech etfs to get something like 3x msft   however i would strongly caution against levered etfs for most retail investors as the fees are high and levered etfs tend to strongly drift away from the index against the investor over anything but the shortest time periods

the simplest way to handle this is for you to rent the apartment and sublet to the girlfriend and friend   i 'd split the utilities evenly one third from each   the reason for this is that each of you contribute evenly to generating the utility bills   it 's not like your income makes the water cost more for you    utilities are driven by usage   dividing them other than equally is likely to lead to more problems than it solves   also it seems unlikely that a different apartment would use significantly different water electricity or internet   those are driven by the appliances rather than the size or location of the apartment   only pay more for the utilities if you want something that they do n't   for example maybe you want hbo etc   it would be reasonable for you to pay the entire premium if that 's a luxury that they simply would n't buy    i 'd also divide the groceries evenly if you share and share alike   if you eat separate meals you can buy separate groceries    if the rent ca n't be split evenly but you could afford it alone then you can just sign up for it   if you break up with the girlfriend and/or the friend moves out you 're still fine   you have your fancy apartment and can afford it    the bigger problem comes if you ca n't afford the apartment without both the girlfriend and friend contributing   if so you should probably avoid this situation   it 's fragile   any person leaving would put you in a financially untenable position   you can look for a new tenant to replace your friend but you ca n't exactly rely on getting a new move in girlfriend on demand    neither the girlfriend nor the friend can afford to be on the main lease   in case of emergency or tragedy they could n't replace you as a tenant   that 's why they should sublet   then their obligation is to you not to the landlord    how much apartment would the girlfriend and friend get if you were n't involved   what rents would they pay   that 's probably how much rent they should pay for this apartment   you want a better apartment or a better location   that 's on you    you should only do this if you want to do it   if you want to share apartments with the girlfriend and friend then do so   work out something equitable   if you plan on moving in together to reduce your costs then you do n't sound like you are compatible   obviously there are reasons to move in with the girlfriend aside from costs   why ca n't the friend get his or her own place   the added rent probably wo n't do more than pay for the added room you could get a one bedroom without the friend    that points to an alternative way of calculating the friend 's contribution   the difference between a two bedroom and a one bedroom apartment   that 's the additional cost of the bigger apartment   if the friend ca n't afford that then this might not be a good idea    make sure that you can afford the apartment if one or both of the friend and girlfriend move out   you can eventually replace the friend as the tenant but do n't rely on doing the same with the girlfriend   share utilities evenly   possibly groceries too   the friend should pay at least the added cost of the additional bedroom   do n't expect either to pay more in the new apartment than they would pay without you   you should be the only one on the main lease sublet to them

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

i do n't know australian law but i will give my us perspective here   the custom in the us is for officers and directors to be by the corporation and that llcs have an even broader power to even to remove the duty of loyalty   moreover directors will typically be able to purchase insurance to protect them from loss in the event of liability for us corporations not llcs the duty of care prudence requires that directors behave responsibly in weighing major decisions and consult experts and specialists before coming to rash decisions   it usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event   the only people with standing in the us are shareholders   if all the other shareholders are directors then it may be hard for them to blame you additionally if you are concerned about the of your actions there may be sources to rely on   first discussion with your fellow directors can be a helpful guide though will not usually you from any accusation of wrongdoing and disclosure tends to cure almost any accusation of breaching the duty of loyalty   second boards often secure the advice of legal counsel and sometimes bring on lawyers as members or will outright hire counsel for the board   third there may be services that will provide you with generic advice e.g. uk companies house and us based which might set you at ease a little bit i do n't know the details of australian law as i say   but my sense of common law countries is that like the us they are primarily concerned about negligence or neglecting to understand the business and make informed decisions fraudulently engaging in self interested transactions that either hurt the company or should have been offered to the company and not bothering to seek out information   as long as you are active informed engaged and not engaging in secret deals outside the company especially deals where either side is competing with the company then that would be more than sufficient under the us standard if you are concerned about liability then inquire into by the company in the us the company can usually pay all legal costs of directors insurance and legal counsel   i imagine your business partners are no more savvy than you are   my impression is you are to relatively rare and exotic expression of corporate law at least in the us but i 'll close by repeating that i do n't know australian corporate law

it 's generally a bad idea to use low risk credit low risk in sense you 're practically guaranteed to be forced to pay it off to buy high risk shares in optimistic scenario the profit from shares would be higher than your credit percentages in less optimistic scenario you come with nothing in worse scenario you have worthless shares and another credit to pay   if your only problem is the non profitable property you can always sell it and get rid of negative cash flow it wo n't affect your quality of life negatively in your high risk scenario you trade the opportunity for a bit better life with for a risk of turning it into disaster for you and your family

i am not familiar with the startup you mentioned but in general there are three approaches to avoid losing money in insurance business review before policy is issued underwriting review before claim is paid claims handling setting high enough rates to cover underwriting losses the fact that is customer friendly lax make your choice of term when issuing a policy says nothing about their rates or claims payment it is even possible they are building a portfolio for sale and do not really care about the claims performance policies are sold customers acquired now and it takes a time for claims to arrive

you should look at the opportunity cost for your money i.e. what kind of return it could generate otherwise   we took advantage of these types of offer zero interest for x months in the past with the goal to redirect the money to the mortgage it was 7.5 back then and we made sure we do n't get hosed by the surprisingly high interest rate by having a big reminder in the bulletin board in the kitchen to make sure we pay off the money before the interest rate kicks in   so we basically reduced our interest on the mortgage during that period   oh we use an all in one account one so that was real nice i would stay away from those interest deferred offers it 's totally not worth it

women entered the work force en mass and with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased that is of course the non pc version and it began earlier than the 80s but it 's essentially correct labor like any other commodity increases in value relative to its scarcity    if all the women or all the men or all of any sizeable group left the labor market the price of labor would begin to increase as companies bid up the price they were willing to pay for each employee with today 's level of globalization this becomes a much more complicated equation do local wages rise or do jobs migrate to abundant and cheap labor but it 's the same idea

here is what we do   we use ynab to do our budgeting and track our expenses   anything that gets paid electronically is tracked to the penny   it really needs to be because you want your transaction records to match your bank 's transaction records however for cash spending we only count the paper money not the coins   here is how it works if i want a coke out of a vending machine for 75 cents and i put a dollar bill in and get a quarter back as change i record that as a $ 1.00 expense if instead i put 3 quarters in to get the coke i do n't record that expense at all   spending coins is free money   we do this mainly because it is just easier to keep track of   i can quickly count the cash in my wallet and verify that it matches the amount that ynab thinks i have in my wallet and i do n't need to worry about the coins   coins that are in my car to pay for parking meters or coins in the dish on my do n't need to be counted this works for us mainly because we do n't do a whole lot of cash spending so the amount we are off just does n't add up to a significant portion of our spending   and again bank balances are exact to the penny

this question had better be asked of the 401k plan administrator rather than here the plan document that you received when you began participating undoubtedly has a page or more of definitions of the terms used in the contract and especially so if the meanings are for example one would expect that a final distribution leaves a balance of $ 0 in the 401k account and so a per distribution fee is meaningless in the context of final distribution as the post by mbhunter indicates withdrawal and distribution seem to be used interchangeably in irs documents and so there probably is a meaning assigned to these terms in the 401k document three possible meanings of these two words come to mind withdrawal = at the request of the participant and distribution = as required by law e.g. required minimum distribution withdrawal = anything before age 59.5 or before termination of employment and distribution =   anything after age 59.5 or after termination of employment withdrawal = anything on which the 10 excise tax for premature distributions must be paid or anything that is not eligible for rollover into another tax deferred account and distribution = anything on which the 10 excise tax does not need to be paid but all the above is just idle speculation and what matters is the plan    document 's definitions of these terms and that can be determined only    if you read your 401k plan document yourself reliance on the answers given    by the employer 's hr department or the plan administrator as to what    the plan document says might or might not be advisable even the irs    has been known to give out incorrect information in general money can not be withdrawn from a 401k plan and rolled over or transferred via a trustee to trustee transfer into another tax deferred plan   while the participant is still employed by the sponsor of the 401k plan since most 401k plans have poor investment choices and excessive administrator fees reflect that absent this prohibition most people would with roll over money from their 401ks into their iras as often as feasible you can withdraw money from a 401k account without paying the 10 excise tax for several reasons including financial needs of various specified kinds but you can not then change your mind and put that money into your ira telling the ira custodian that it is a rollover from the 401k to do so will not just trigger the 10 excise tax on premature distributions from a 401k account but you will also need to pay penalties for excess contributions to your ira

your question points out how most fractional reserve banks are only a couple of defaults away from insolvency the problem arises because of the terms around the depositors money   when a customer deposits money into a bank they are loaning their money to the bank and the bank takes ownership of the money   deposit and savings account are considered on demand accounts where the customer is told they can retrieve their money at any time   this is a strange type of loan is it not   no other loan works this way   there are always terms around loans how often the borrower will make payments when will the borrower pay back the loan what is the total time frame of the loan etc   the bank runs into problems because the time frame on the money they borrowed i.e. deposits does not match the time frame on the money they are lending

this may sound very tongue in cheek but the best thing you can invest in is to raise your income in order to increase your retirement savings   how much are you able to contribute to retirement now   i think you would be lucky to do $ and most months probably less than that   however if you were making like 60k year and allowed a little lifestyle bloat you could probably easy put away 20k year   once you are able to do that the savings you can manage now will be quickly    often times when people consider having their money work for them they often neglect to factor risk   prior to investing one should have a proper emergency fund in place   that is 6 months or so of living expenses in a nice safe savings account   those earn about 1.25 these days which is pretty meager but it does earn something    once the emergency fund is in place one can invest with impunity   without it you will have to liquidate investments if economic calamity strikes you   this could be done at a loss furthering the harm done by the calamity    increase your income and create an emergency fund   do those things first

do new automobiles typically release in low numbers and later you say   the car released 2 days ago i called around and discovered local dealers only have ~10 2018 's total for all so you are calling local dealers and they have ten after two days   let 's say you are in new york city population eight million about 2.5 of the united states population   that would suggest that there are around four hundred produced in two days 10 is 2.5 of 400 or two hundred a day   that would be four thousand a month assuming four weeks each with five   considering that the most sold in a month were in june of 2013 and march 's was the best this year that seems to be a decent pace if a little slow to start    now let 's assume that you are using a local area with a population of only two million   this could still be new york city if you only call dealers in a quarter of the area   their two day pace would put them on a rate to produce sixteen thousand the first month which is more than they can reasonably expect to sell    if your local area is an even smaller portion of the us overall this might not actually be low inventory    do n't forget that some dealers may also still have 2017 vehicles left   they might want to sell those before they order too many new vehicles   particularly as they may not know what feature packages sell best yet   if they 're willing to tell you that they have three and sold a fourth they should be eager to tell you how many they have   a high 2018 price gives them a better chance to sell the at a profit    if you really want to check if they are having production problems ask how long it will be to order a vehicle   for a us manufactured car special order should fall in the five to eight weeks range   if that 's what they 're quoting then there probably are not production problems    when trading with a dealer do your research tell them what you believe a fair price is and then be ready to walk if they wo n't give it to you   be up front   tell them that you 're willing to pay $ x to the first dealer that takes the offer   you 'd prefer that dealer because whatever maybe they 're closest but you are n't paying more than $ x.   if they let you get in your car and drive away then they really think they can get a better price

that 's true about but that 's not the problem with tv advertising the problem is   if you 've ever listened to talk radio sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting   yet during this time you do n't need to adjust your radio 's volume the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume   if you the crap out of your commercial 's sound and then normalize it to 95 of the peak of the tv show 's sound which is typically not nearly as compressed then your commercial is going to be perceived as vastly louder than the tv show even though it never exceeds 95 of the tv show 's peak volume   thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires   it still seems easy to work around though just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud house waking marketing slime   what they need to do is require that neither the average nor the peak db level of the commercial may exceed the average db level of the show   there might be cute little tricks that can get around that too but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical on the audio just to wake everyone up

you 're right about your suspicions i 'm not a professional i suggest you talk to a real one a one with cpa ea or attorney credentials and license in your state but i would be very cautious in this case the irs will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband he 'd have to prove it to be otherwise it does seem to be related to his performance and i doubt that had they not known him through his employment they 'd give him such a gift i may be wrong so may be an irs revenue officer but i 'd bet he 'd think the same did they give gifts like that to anyone else if they did was it to other employees or they gave similar gifts to all their friends and family did those who gave your husband a gift file a gift tax return had they paid the gift tax were they principles in the partnership or they were limited partners i.e. not the ones with authority to make any decision was your husband instrumental in making their extraordinary profit or his job was not related to the profits these people made these questions are about the facts and circumstances of the transaction based on what he can find out and other potential information your husband will have to decide whether he can reasonably claim that it was a gift beware unreasonable claims lead to equally unreasonable penalties and charges irs and your state will definitely want to know more about this transaction its not an amount to slide under the radar this is not a matter where you can rely on a free opinions written by amateurs who do n't know the whole story you or rather your husband are highly encouraged to hire a paid professional a cpa ea enrolled agent or tax attorney with enough experience in fighting gift vs income characterization issues against the irs and the state do n't forget your state an experienced professional may be able to identify something in the facts and the circumstances of the situation that would lead to reducing the tax bill or shifting it to the partners but it is not something you do on your own

i would like to add to the answer provided by dheer i think under some you need not pay premium after 3 years and you can take the money back after 5 years something like that read your policy statement of course since the money is invested in stock markets and since generally people say the longer money stays in stocks the better you can keep the money with them without taking it back and without paying any further premium that way whatever you paid will be invested and you can get it back later when you feel you will make a profit

commonly get good payouts from these things   first when companies are in some of bankruptcy or financial distress they are forced to pay more to retain certain personnel due to the nature of the situation if the executives left then nobody would be willing to come in and wind up the assets of the company it would end up costing even more money in the long run because you wo n't get talented people and you will have to bring in people with little to no knowledge of your company or your industry   second bankruptcy law provides very clear guidelines for the priority of different creditors and this is tied into the incentives that we want to encourage if secured creditors did not get priority then they would never lend and we would not have economic growth the reason equity shareholders are last in priority is because they took on the risk of owning the company

amazon has 2 different cards you can apply for a store card and a credit card the credit card is through chase the deal is not a scam i can confirm this because i applied for their credit card and got $ 70 in the form of a digital gift card by giving customers free money for signing up for their cards they get more people who are willing to give it a try once you have a card you get benefits like 3 5 percent back on amazon purchases that will entice consumers to use the card amazon likely has an agreement with chase and they are hoping to get you hooked with the free money and benefits

i am going to clone an answer from another question that i wrote and refer you to an article in the wall street journal that i read this morning   what 's at stake in the greek vote summarizing the likely outcome of the situation if a euro exit looks likely after the election we will see a full fledged bank run greek banks would collapse the market exchange rate would likely be two or three drachmas to the euro which would double or triple the greek price of imported goods within a few days prices of assets including real estate assets would crumble those who moved their deposits abroad would be able to buy these assets cheaply leading to a significant regressive redistribution of greek wealth in short you 'd lose about two thirds of your savings unless you were storing them somewhere safe from the conversion the article also predicts difficulty importing goods other nations will demand to be paid in euro not drachma leading to disruption of trade and various supply shortages

while it ’s your personal choice on how you save for later its essential that you save my sister works in a bank and recommended me not to put any money into retirement plans since the tax advances seem fine but have to paid back when you take the money out of the accounts in switzerland do n't know about the united states many reasons exist that you suddenly need the money buying a house needing a new car health issues or just leaving the country forever and the government trying to make it as hard as possible for you to get your money back i recommend putting it on a savings account on a different bank that you normally use without any cards and so on in short it can be dangerous to have money locked away especially if you could easily have it at your hands and you know you 're able to manage it

the two things are materially different point number 1   with a credit card the bank and card network earn a fee every time you spend on your card   you swipe a $ 100 dinner the credit card company makes about $ 3   you pay it back they may not make any interest but they 've made their $ 3   additionally if you have a $ 1,000,000 credit limit you 've only actually borrowed $ 100 which brings me to point number 2    point number 2   a credit limit of $ x is not in any way the same as a loan for $ x.   when you seek a personal loan the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan less any origination fees that may apply   your loan for $ 8,000 results in $ 8,000 being wired to your account   your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something   until then its a simple adjustable risk limit set by the bank 's underwriters point number 3   your credit report contains no income information   it 's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they 're willing to take   some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information   some lenders want to see some pay stubs   some lenders will lend $ x on stated income but wo n't lend $ x+1 without income verification   some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment   it 's all lender specific   credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2 point number 4   if you 're getting a loan for your required mortgage down payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize

taxes are a tool for achieving social policy goals while americans consider socialism to be a curse the us is in fact quite socialistic mostly towards corporations but sometimes even the normal people not only the corporation are people my friend m. romney get some discounts the tax deduction on mortgage interest comes as a tool to encourage americans to own their homes it is important socially for people to own their home to be independent and in general contributes to the stability of the society as anything when taken to the extreme it in fact achieves exactly the opposite as we 've seen in 2008 but when balanced works well capital gain is taxed in the us because it is income generally any income is taxed however gain sourced from the sale of primary residence is excluded up to a certain quite large amount from this tax if lived in the residence long enough 3 of the last 5 years prior to sale this again to encourage americans to upgrade their houses and make it easier for americans to relocate when needed sell one house and buy another without losing cash on taxes as to asset producing income that is true in the us as well you can not deduct your personal expenses in general mortgage interest on primary residence is a notable exception because it serves a social cause similarly medical expenses are allowed as a deduction if they 're above certain limit and many other things for example if a us person totals his car and insurance does n't cover the loss it is tax deductible above certain limit the higher the income the higher the limit these are purely social policy breaks socialism something americans like to have and love to hate many anti socialists in the us are in fact taking advantage of these specific tax breaks the most because for rich folks these are limited or non existent mortgage interest limited up to 1 million medical expenses are allowed only above certain percentage of income etc

if the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months it would mean banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the monthly billing cycle for example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th means if you swipe your card on 1st day one would effectively get a credit for 30 + 14 around 44 days if you swipe on last day one would get a credit for 14 days on an average 22 days of credit if we make this 3 months the credit period would increase on an average 90 + 52 days from a risk point of view on monthly cycle if there is non payment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle on offering different dates shop around in the older times the cycles were different however with individuals having several cards and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates

rebalancing has been studied empirically quite a bit but not particularly carefully and actually turns out to be very hard to study well   the main problem is that you do n't know until afterward if your target weights were optimal so a bad rebalancing program might give better performance if it closer to optimal weights even if it did n't do an efficient job of keeping near the target weights in your particular case either method might be preferred depending on a number of things you can see why there is n't a generally correct answer to your question and the results of empirical studies might very wildly depending on the mix of assets and risk tolerance   still if your portfolio is not too complicated you can estimate the costs of the two methods without too much trouble and figure out if it is worthwhile to you edit in response to comment below your example gets at what makes rebalancing so hard empirically but also generally pretty easy in practice   if you were to target 75 equity 25 bonds and look at returns only for 30 years the best rebalancing method would be to never rebalance and just let 75 equity go to near 100 as equity has better long term returns   this happens when you look only at returns as the final number and do n't take into account the change in risk in your portfolio in practice most people that are still adding or subtracting in retirement to a retirement portfolio are adding removing a significant amount compared to the total amount in their portfolio   in the case you it is cheaper massively cheaper in the presence of load fees just to use new capital to trade toward your target keeping your risk profile   new money should be large enough to keep you near enough your target   if you just estimate the trading costs fees in both cases i think you 'll see just how large the difference is between the two methods this will dwarf any small differences in return over the long run even if you ca n't trade back all the way to your target

very likely this refers to trading speculating on leverage not investing of course as soon as you put leverage into the equation this perfectly makes sense   2007 2009 for example if one bought the $ spx at its highs in 2007 at to the lows from 2009 at that with only 2:1 leverage a $ account would have received a margin call at least here in europe i can trade index cfd 's and other leveraged products if i trade lets say > 50:1 leverage it does n’t take much to get a margin call and/or position closed by the broker no doubt depending on which investments you choose there ’s always risk but currency is a position too to answer the question i find it very unlikely that > 90 of investors referring to stocks lose money purchasing power anyway i would not deny that where speculators not investors use leverage or try to trade swings news etc have a very high risk of losing money purchasing power

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

two points you do n't really get the full 10,000 annual interest as tax free income   well you do but you would have gotten a substantial amount of that anyway as the standard deduction from the irs standard deduction the standard deduction for married couples filing a joint return is at $ for 2012 the standard deduction for single individuals and married couples filing separate returns is $ for 2012 the standard deduction for heads of household increases by $ 50 to $ for 2012 so if you were married it would n't even make sense to claim the 10,000 mortgage interest deduction as the standard one is larger it can make sense to do what you are talking about but ultimately you have to decide what the effective interest rate on your mortgage is and if you can afford it for instance   i might have a 5 mortgage   if i am in a 20 tax bracket it effectively is a 4 mortgage to me   even though i am saving tax money i am still paying effectively 4   ultimately the variables are too complex to generalize any hard and fast rules but it often times does make sense you should also be aware that there has been some talk of eliminating or phasing out the mortgage interest deduction as a way to close the deficit and reduce the debt

the simple answer is yes the jp morgan emerging markets equity fund is a mutual fund a mutual fund is a pooling of money from investors to invest in stocks and bonds investors in mutual funds arrive there in different ways some get there via their company 401 k others by an ira still others as a taxable account the fund can be sold by the company directly or through a broker you can also have a fund of funds so the investors are other funds   some investors are only indirect investors they are owed a pension by a past or current employer and the pension fund has invested in a mutual fund

if you look at the biotech breakdown you 'll find a lot of when it comes to p e since there are many young biotech companies that have yet to make a profit   thus there may be something to be said for how is the entire industry stat computed biotechnology can include pharmaceutical companies that can have big profits due to patents on drugs as an example look at plc which has a p e of which is pretty high with a market capitalization of over a billion dollars so this is n't a small company   i wonder what dot com companies would have looked like in that could well be similar as some industries will have bubbles you do realize right the reason for pointing out the market capitalization is that this a way to measure the size of a company as this is merely the sum of all the stock of the company   there could be small companies that have low market that could have high p es as they are relatively young and could be believed to have enough hype that there is a great deal of confidence in the stock   for example amazon.com was public for years before turning a profit   in being without profits there is no p e and thus it is worth understanding the limitations of a p e as the computation just takes the previous year 's earnings for a company divided by the current stock price   if the expected growth rate is high enough this can be a way to justify a high p e for a stock   the question you asked about an industry having this is the derivation from a set of stocks   if most of the stocks are high enough then whatever mean or median one wants to use as the industry average will come from that

why should capital gains be taxed at a lower rate than labor it is because the tax code is really a philosophical tool while also raising the revenues required to fund the government   i get to vote for federal state and local representatives the constitution is a federal system that should be sufficient reason for 100 of the conservative movement exist in a separate category but their share of the electorate with every tweet

the fund will take a small percentage of its assets to cover the expenses   reported returns come after the expense ratio has been factored into things money market mutual funds can have a zero yield in some cases though breaking the buck can happen in some cases as noted on wikipedia the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first    for daily income in 1978 liquidating and    nav at 94 cents per share an argument has been made that was not    technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the    average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two    however prospective investors were informed that would invest    solely in short term 30 90 days money market obligations    furthermore the rule which restricts the maturities which money    market funds are permitted to invest in rule of the investment    company act of 1940 was not until 1983 prior to the    adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than    present itself as a money market fund which did seeking higher    yield had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and    rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio    in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a    certificate of deposit at a 3 loss triggering a of its    nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the    buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in 1994    paying investors 96 cents per share this was only the second failure    in the then history of money funds and there were no further    failures for 14 years the fund had invested a large percentage of its    assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased    these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an    institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals    were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september 2008 a month that saw    events for money funds however as noted above other    failures were only averted by of capital from the fund    sponsors thus consider how likely is fidelity investments prepared to have people question how safe is their money with them which is why fund sponsors rarely break the buck

if it was typical above the board and no profits were made then why did it take a hotly contested bill from congress that was amended and watered down to bring these transactions to light   why not just use the normal discount window for these overnight loans if everything was just run of the mill overnight loans    why were they making these standard 0 overnight loans to select private investors

even worse many more times companies will go through an $ 8 million project to fix an issue that costs $ 20   just 2 examples from my company    1 a big project to automate the entry of 2 invoices per month from a supplier is would take an employee less than 10 minutes a month to enter those 2 invoices manually into the system   2 a big project to provide a website for employees to buy the company 's products employee sales i showed that on average less than 1 order is placed per day except december when the company has extra discounts and then there are 3 sales a day my solution offer a coupon for employees to buy the same products on the existing b2c site   p s yes i did the 1st project why would i complain and point out the obvious those silly projects are more than a job security for me i would probably even get a prize for job well done

i ca n't think of any more negatives apart from what you mentioned but the positives might include higher cost base for when you sell the place this only applies in australia if it is an investment property thus having to pay less tax on the capital gains and being able to borrowing extra funds which may help with your cashflow especially if you keep the extra funds in an 100 offset account so your interest payable is not increased until you really need the extra funds

i do n't think that there is any good way a study can average this and bring a useful result the core problem is that there are people that will spend more money than they should if they become technically able to and the credit card is just one of the tools they abuse for that similar to re financing with cash outs zero percent loans etc   on the other side there are people who control and understand their spending and again the mechanism of payment is irrelevant for them studies measure some mix between the groups and come up with irrelevant correlations that have no causality if you think any tool or mechanics got you in financial trouble think again your spending habits and lack of understanding or care get you in financial trouble nothing else in a world where it is considered cool to do n't understand math it is no surprise that so many people ca n't control their finances

that 2 t is if you invest the money for a decade before cutting checks which is the methodology with which i mentioned i disagree   from the article   gt after spending a little quality time in microsoft excel i ’d say it ’s somewhere the ballpark of $ 1,350 per household or $ 1,000 per worker   if you divide $ 1000 per worker by ten years you get $ 100 per year which is what i said and which the title   edit i see what you mean i typed households instead of workers thanks for pointing out my typo i edited the comment to correct and show i originally also i put instead of 2 t either way the point is it is $ 100 per year not $ 1000 i should ’ve paid attention when commenting but the point remains valid

ipo 's are priced so that there 's a pop on the opening day if i were my company and the price popped on the open i would think the underwriter priced it too low in fact if i were to ipo i 'd seek an underwriter whose offerings consistently traded on the first day pretty unchanged that means they priced it correctly in the 90 's ipo boom there were stocks that opened up 3x and more the original owners must have been pretty upset as the poor pricing guidance the underwriter offered
