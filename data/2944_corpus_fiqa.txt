this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

my wife    shitty genetics lots of health problems    by her own admission at least 10 iq points down from alcohol drug exposure being fed alcohol drugs by her abusive mother beginning at age 3 or earlier compensates by writing down everything in lists so she can remember things    grew up in rural indiana dirt poor abused physically emotionally and sexually    realized at age 12 that she 'd be pregnant by 15 if she did n't find a way out    on her own initiative found a relative out of state to live with not a happy living situation but it allowed her to at least graduate high school    got into college not a great college but at least college    got a degree    took a job teaching in an poverty stricken area so she could give back to kids growing up the way she did   yup all luck she never could have done it without all that luck oh wait a second no she took responsibility for her own life and made something of herself instead of kicking back and waiting for a handout like all her friends and family who oddly have n't had much luck since and still live in poverty in rural indiana     did i mention she makes more money works less hours and has better benefits than i do

the advantage of using a mortgage is that you pay for a house at today 's price using tomorrow 's money your question suggests that you rightly observed that it was not a good idea around 2006 the last peak in housing that was when prices were at their maximum and had nowhere to go but down some experts think that house prices still have further to go on the downside meanwhile wages have been going nowhere during that time this phenomenon seems to happen about every 40 years or so the 1930s the 1970s and around 2010 at most other times say the 1980s houses are likely to go up for the foreseeable future at those times you want to buy the house at today 's price then pay for it in future dollars when you are earning more money the irony is that what most people observe as teenagers is usually the wrong thing to do when they are say forty in it will probably make sense to have a large mortgage in a bull housing market which is the opposite of what you observed around 2010 so a better rule is to do at age 40 what made sense about the time you were born in your case perhaps the 1990s whereas the people born in the early 1970s that got caught recently observed the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s in their teens and twenties rather than the bear market of the 1970s that took place about the time they were born

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910 there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough and gold possession had to be outlawed well partially so no we were not on a gold standard   secondly when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

i was clarifying a point someone else made i do n't take any ownership of the claim however none of what i said is particularly far fetched especially considering wal mart has a net income of close to $ q =   also i did n't say that the job deserves higher pay in addition there 's no reason i can see why a pay increase would result in wal mart laying off 30 50 of its workforce they either need the manpower to operate the stores or they do n't and that financial statement would indicate that they could absorb a slight increase in overhead   sorry for the way you were treated there particularly the a week part i do n't know the ins and outs of wal mart 's policies but i 'm guessing this was a way to circumvent a policy that grants certain benefits to week workers

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

as nathan has correctly noted ach processes transactions in daily batches the reason for that is accounting the money does n't actually change hands for each transaction all the transactions are aggregated and calculated in the batch process and the money only changes hands for the difference consider this if each transaction was to be handled separately each time banks would have to adjust their books to account for the money movement but if we do it in batch we have this the resulting inter bank transfers total for the original 30 transactions 2 transactions between the banks and if you need money to be transferred immediately relatively you can use wire transfer some banks will still aggregate and batch process those but more than once a day they 'll charge you additional fee for their inconvenience

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

yes you are generally allowed to make contributions yourself to your hsa even if your employer also made contributions let me explain further the contribution limit for tax year 2015 is $ for individual coverage   it is higher for family coverage or for account holders age 55 +   the limit is for everything contributed to the hsa whether it is an employer contribution or an account holder contribution   in other words if your limit is $ and your employer contributed $ 3000 you can only contribute $ 350 as far as the irs is concerned anything that your employer sends in is considered an employer contribution   this might be money from the company as part of a benefit or it might be money deducted from your salary as part of a voluntary contribution on your part   either way if the employer sends it in it is an employer contribution   none of this employer contribution shows up on your w-2 as taxable income so you do n't get to deduct it on your tax return   it has already been taken off of your income money that you send in yourself with your after tax dollars is your account holder contribution   this is money that you can deduct on your tax return so that you are n't paying tax on this money so here is what you need to do determine your total hsa contribution limit for tax year 2015 find out how much your employer has already contributed for 2015   the difference is how much you can still contribute for 2015 contact your hsa provider and find out how to make a 2015 contribution   do n't just send money in because there is probably a form they want you to fill out to make a prior year contribution get all this done by april 15 the deadline for making a prior year contribution   actually get it done before april 15 because often there will be some sort of delay of a day or two that will prevent you from doing this on the last day

1 what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price    automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even when the company earns cash beyond what is needed for expenses the value of the firm increases as a shareholder you own a piece of that increased value as soon as the company earns it when the dividend is paid the value of the firm decreases but you break even on the dividend transaction the benefit to you in holding the company 's shares is the continually increasing value whether paid out to you or retained be careful not to confuse the value of the firm with the stock price the stock price is ever changing in the short term driven mostly by investor emotion over the long term by far the largest effect on stock price is earnings take an extreme and simplistic example the company never grows or shrinks earnings are always the same there is no inflation and they pay everything out in dividends by the reasoning above the firm value never changes so over the long term the stock price will never change but you still get your quarterly dividends

# 486243
to me this sounds like a transaction where e already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from d and give d 25 of the profits every year there is nothing objective like a piece of paper that states the company is worth 400k. it is all about perceived value some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have heck the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it so is it actually the case that e 's company is worth 400k only after the transaction it is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it i the 400 k valuation is subjective in return the investor is getting 25 ownership of the product or company the idea is that when someone has ownership they have a vested interest in it being successful in that case the investor will do whatever he she can to improve the chances of success in addition to supplying the 100 k capital for instance the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash perhaps it is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory for instance and would the other 300k be listed as an ip asset no see what i said about the valuation just being perception note that the above analysis does n't apply to all dragons den deals it only applies to situations where capital is exchanged for ownership in the form of equity

md tech answered the answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract   if the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will in the first instance be billed by any intermediary prime broker etc that facilitated the contract if they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can net off any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins the contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can but do n't need to report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment if there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract if they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including but not limited to seizure of assets enforced bankruptcy and prison terms for any of court rulings all of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war it has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as i know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict as well as the hard results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further potential employees and will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit the end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party 's cash flows positive and negative are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3 m + 500k = 3.5 m and total are 1.2 m + 1.1 m + 1.2 m = 3.5 m so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into 's account of 0

craig touched on it but let me expand on the point deposits by definition are withheld at your marginal rate and since you can choose roth vs traditional right till filing time you know with certainty the rate you are at each year   absent any other retirement income i.e. no pension and absent an incredibly major change to our tax code i know your starting rate zero the first $ 10 k or so per person is part of their standard deduction and exemption for a couple the next $ 18k is taxed at 10 and so on let me stop here to expand this important point this is $ for the couple and the tax on it is less than $ 1900 5 there is no 5 bracket of course it 's the first $ 20 k with zero tax and that first $ 18,000 taxed at 10 that $ takes nearly $ 1 m in pretax accounts to offer as an annual withdrawal the 15 bracket starts after this and applies to the next $ 57 k of withdrawals each year over $ 95 k in gross withdrawals of pretax money and you still are n't in the 25 bracket   this is why 100 in traditional or 100 in roth are n't either ideal i continue to offer the example i consider more optimizing using roth for income that would otherwise be taxed at 15 but going pretax when you hit 25 then at retirement you withdraw enough traditional to just stay at 10 or 15 and roth for the rest   it would be a shame to retire 100 roth and realize you paid 25 but now have no income to use up those lower brackets   oddly time value of money is n't part of my analysis it makes no difference and note the exact numbers do change a bit each year for inflation there 's a also a good chance the exemptions goes away in favor of a huge increased standard deduction

here 's another way that i look at it   say you and me were 50 50 partners in a small business suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money someone let 's call him warren has the money we need hence in return for the money we offer warren an equal stake in the business   i.e. all three of us own 33 stake now for both you and me our stake reduced from   50 that it was before warren 's entry to only 33 now   while that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us we both agreed to give warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand   ergo what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie itself and hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances   two small points a this does n't   in any way show the dilution must make sense only that it can sometimes make sense b of course in the case of a large corporation they do not need your personal approval for the dilution but hey neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product

ok so greece and funding of the banks has added quite a bit of deficit over the past couple of years this has been problematic as countries become unwilling to ask for help to save the bank because of the poor public image that it carries no politician wants to increase the deficit in favor of bank expect americans lol additionally it has a negative impact on economy discussed below   this year ecb has agreed to allow direct of banks   this means that the spanish govt will not be responsible for bank funding when the bailout is established thus reducing the impact on spain 's economy there will not be an increase in deficit when spanish banks are   in the past with ireland and greece it was difficult because countries had to implement austerity measure and accept funding to bank weakened balance sheet of troubled countries drove up the cost of money making it more difficult to the banks which worked in a cycle direct has been implemented to limit this effect

forex trading contracts are generally fairly short dated as you mention   months to weeks   professional forex traders often extend the length of their bet by rolling monthly or quarterly contracts   closing a contract out a few days before it would expire and a new contract for the next quarter month   this process can be rather expensive and time consuming for a retail investor however a more practical but also not great method would be to look into currency etfs   the etfs generally do the above process for you and are significantly more convenient   however depending on the broker these may not be available and when available can be illiquid and/or expensive even in major currency pairs   it 's worth a bunch of research before you buy note in both cases you are in a practical sense doubling your nok exposure as your home currency is nok as well   this may be riskier than many people would care to be with their retirement money   an adverse move would at the same time you would lose money make it much to buy foreign goods which frankly is most goods in a small open country like norway the most simple solution would be to overweight local nok stocks or if you believe stocks are overvalued as you mention nok denominated bonds   with this you keep your nok exposure a currency you believe will appreciate without doubling it as well as add expected returns above inflation from the stock growth dividends or bond real interest rates

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

i assume i can will need to file an 83(b election in order to avoid    tax repercussions what exactly will this save me from 83(b election is for restricted stock grants not for stock purchases for restricted stocks you generally pay income tax when they vest for startups the price difference between the time of the grant and the time of the vesting can be astronomical and by choosing 83(b you effectively pay income tax on the value of the grant instead of the value of the vest then you only pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the grant value when you sell in your case you 're exercising an option i.e. you 're buying a stock so 83(b is irrelevant what you will pay though is the tax on the difference between the strike price and the stock fmv unless the stocks you end up buying are restricted which would have been the case if you exercised your options early but i do n't think is going to be the case now what steps should i take to in the eyes of the law guarantee that    the board has received my execution notice the secretary of the board    is a notorious and can be very unorganized you should read what the grant contract company policy says on that ask the hr manager usually a certified letter with return receipt should be enough but you should verify the format the address and the timeframe

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

this is more of a long comment but may answer user 's situation too i have dealt with joint mortgages before in 3 states in the us   basically in all three states if one party wants to sell the home goes up for sale   this can be voluntary or it can go up via auction not a great choice in 2 of the 3 states the first person to respond to the court about the property the other party pays all legal fees   yes you read this right   in one case i had an ex who was on my mortgage she had no money invested in the house $ 0 down and still in college with no job   if she was n't on the mortgage i would n't have gotten loan old days of dumb rules when we split her lawyer was using the house as a way to extort other money from me   knowing the state 's laws i already filed a petition for the property but put it on hold with the clerk   meaning that no one else could file but if someone tried mine would no longer be on hold   my ex literally spent thousands of dollars on this attorney and they wanted to sell the house and get half the money from the house   so sale price minus loan amount divided between us   this is the law in almost every state if there is no formal contract   i was laughing because she wanted what would be maybe 50 75 k for paying no rent no money down and me paying for her college finally i broke her attorney down i did n't lawyer up but had many friends who were lawyers advising   after i told her lawyer she was n't getting anything might have said it in not a nice way her lawyer gave me her break down   to paraphrase she said we are going to file now   my assistant is in the court clerk 's office   you can tell the court whatever you want   maybe they will give you a greater percentage since you put the money down and paid for everything but you are taking that chance   but you will pay for your lawyer and you will need one   and you will pay for me the entire time   and this will be a lengthy process   you would be better served to pay my client half now her office was about 2 blocks from court   i laughed at her and simply told her to have her assistant do whatever she wanted   i then left to go to clerk 's office to take the hold off   she had beat me to the office i moved my car out of her garage   by the time i got there she was outside yelling at her assistant throwing a fit and papers were flying everywhere   we settled the next day   she got nothing other than the things she had already stolen from me   if i would n't have known about this loophole my ex would have gotten or cost me through attorney 's fees around 40 50 k for basically hiring a lawyer   my ex did n't really have any money so i am pretty sure lawyer was getting a percent moral of the story in any contract like this you always want to be the one bringing in the least amount of money   there are no laws that i know of in any country where the person with the least amount on a contract will come out worse   like i said in the us the best case scenario that i know of for joint property is that the court pays out the stakeholder all of their contributions then it splits things 50/50   this is given no formal contract that the court   do n't even get me started with hiring attorneys because i have seen the courts throw out so many property contracts it is n't even funny   one piece of advice on a contract if you do one   make it open and about percentages   party a contributes 50 k party b 10 k party a will pay this of mortgage and maintenance and will get this when home is sold   i have found the more specific things are the more loopholes for getting out of them there are goofy ass laws everywhere that make no sense   why would the person first filing get their lawyers paid for   the court systems in almost all countries can have their comical corners    you will never be able to write a contract that covers everything   if the shower handle breaks who pays for it   there is just too many one off things with a house you are in essence getting in a relationship with this person   i hear others say it is a business transaction    no   you are living with this person   there is no way to make it purely business   for you to be happy with this outcome both of you must remain somewhat friends and at the very least civil with each other    to add on to the previous point the biggest risk is this other person 's character and state of mind   they are putting in the most money so you do n't exactly have a huge money risk   you do have a time and a time cost risk   your time or the money you do have in this may be tied up in trying to get your money out or house sold   a jerk could basically say that you get nothing and make you the court system for a couple years to get a few thousand back and that is n't the worst case scenario   always know your worst case scenario   yours is this dude is in love with you   when he figures out 2 3 years later after making you feel uncomfortable the entire time that you are not in love with him he starts going nuts   so he systematically destroys your house   your house worth plummets you want out you ca n't sell the house for price of loan lenders foreclose or look to sue you you pay double rent because you ca n't live with the guy and you have to push a scooter to get to work that is just the worst case scenario   would i do this if i were 25 and had no family   yea why not if i trusted the other person and was friends with them   if it were just a co worker   that is really iffy with me     edit author said he will not be living with the person   so wording can be changed to say potentially in front of living with him in my examples

did recognize the problem of democracy if a society like ours is facing massive inequality he thought that the majority the poor would vote in their own interest and take away from the minority the rich so he thought the solution is to decrease inequality and increase democracy   notice madison recognized the same problem in the american system but he came to the opposite conclusion he thought democracy should be reduced and power be left in the hands of the more capable set of men the wealthy elite   now the society you are describing would probably be self destructive if people went around having a mob mentality as you describe looting and committing violence this would be more like a death cult at some point you have to recognize that common people are usually the target of oppression not the cause of it ironically all the examples you mentioned were imposed by the powerful few on the not the other way around

usually when a company is performing well both its share price and its dividends will increase over the medium to long term similarly if the company is performing badly both the share price and dividends will fall over time if you want to invest in higher dividend stocks over the medium term you should look for companies that are performing well fundamentally and technically choose companies that are increasing earnings and dividends year after year and with earnings per share greater than dividends per share choose companies with share prices increasing over time uptrending then once you have purchased your portfolio of high dividend stocks place a trailing stop loss on them for a timeframe of 1 to 3 years i would choose a trailing stop loss of 20 this means that if the share price continues going up you keep benefiting from the dividends and increasing share price but if the share price drops by 20 below the recent high then you get automatically taken out of that stock leaving your emotions out of it this will ensure your capital is protected over your investment timeframe and that you will profit from both capital growth and rising dividends from your portfolio

depends on how far down the market is heading how certain you are that it is going that way when you think it will fall and how risk averse you are   by better i will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital if you are very certain the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put   if you can borrow some money to buy even more puts you will make even more   use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today 's prices   but remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor   a short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage   the of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required   futures trade in large denominations so think about how much you are able to put to risk the inverse etfs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above   the levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward   you can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower directly short selling an etf or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky   on par with the inverse etfs

there are several reasons it is not recommended to trade stocks pre- or post market meaning outside of regular trading hours since your question is not very detailed i have to assume you trade with a time horizon of at least more than a day meaning you do not trade intra day if this is true all of the above points are a non issue for you and a different set of points becomes important as a general rule using 3 is the safest regardless of what and how you trade because you get price guarantee in trade for execution guarantee in the case of mid to longer term trading 1 any of those points is viable depending on how you want to do things what your style is and what is the most comfortable for you a few remarks though 2 are market orders so if the open is quite the ride and you are in the back of the execution queue you can get significant slippage 1 may require live data of the post market session which is often not easy to come by for the entire us stock universe depending on your physical execution method phone fax online you may lack accurate information of the post market if you want to execute orders based on and only want to do that after hours because of personal schedule constraints this is not really important personally i would always recommend 3 independent of the use case because it allows you more control over your orders and their fills tl;dr if you are trading long term it does not really matter if you go down to the intra day level of holding time it becomes relevant

a great deal of analysis on this question relies on misunderstandings of the market or noticing trends that happened at the same time but were not caused by each other   without knowing your view i 'll just give the basic idea the amount of active management is self correcting   the reason people have moved out of actively managed funds is that the funds have not been performing well   their objective is to beat their benchmarks by profiting as they correct mispricing   they are performing poorly because there is too much money chasing too few   that is why the actively managed industry is shrinking   if it gets small enough presumably those opportunities will become more abundant and mispricing correction will become more profitable   then money will flow back into active funds relevant active management may not be what a lay person is thinking of   at the retail level we are observing a shift to passive funds but there is still plenty of money in other places   for example pension and endowment funds normally have an objective of beating a market benchmark like the russell 3000   as a result they are constantly trying to find opportunities to invest in active management that really can outperform   they represent a great deal of money and are nothing like the buy and forget stereotype we sometimes imagine   moreover hedge funds and trading shops explicitly and solely try to correct   they represent a very very large bucket of money that is not shrinking   active retail mutual funds and individual investors are not as relevant for pricing as we might think   more trading volume is not necessarily a good thing nor is it the measure of market quality   one argument against passive funds is that passive funds do n't trade much   yet the volume of trading in the markets has risen dramatically over time as a result of technological improvements algorithmic traders mostly   they have out competed certain market makers who used to make money on inefficiencies of the market   is this a good thing or a bad thing   well prices are more efficient now and it appears that these computers are more responsive to price relevant information than people used to be   so even if trading volume does decrease i see no reason to worry that prices will become less efficient   that 's not the direction things have gone even as passive investing has boomed overall worries about passive investing rely on an assumption that there is not enough interest in and resources for making arbitrage profits to keep prices efficient   this is highly counterfactual and always will be   as long as people and institutions want money and have access to the markets there will be plenty of resources allocated to price correction

the most important thing is to keep in mind the deadline if you want to have it count for 2016 you need to open the account and transfer the funds by tax day do n't wait until the last day to do it or you could run out of time setting up the initial account and them verifying your information and transferring the money could take a few days first decide how much of a lump sum you want to invest   initially this will determine some of your options because the mutual fund will have a minimum initial investment many of the funds will allow subsequent investments to be smaller   the beauty of a ira or roth ira is that if the fund you want is out of reach for this initial investment in a few years you can transfer the money into another fund or even another fund family without having to worry about tax issues now decide on your risk level and you time horizon because you said you are student and you want a roth ira it is assumed that you will not need this money for 4 + decades so you can and should be willing to be a little more risky as said an index fund is a great idea many also advise an aged based fund my kids found that when they made their initial investments the age based funds were the only one with a low enough initial investment for their first few years   then pick a fund family based on the general low fees and a large mix of options the best thing is that in a few years as you have more money and more options you can adjust your choices

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

the only reason i can think of would be if you were convinced that you could n't hold on to your money treasury bonds are often viewed as very safe investments and often used in some situations where cash is n't appropriate also they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme helping your country to grow in addition many people do n't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds but are just investing in them the more people investing in them the lower the yields become but the bottom line is i would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate and it looks like i 'm in good company as well a quick study of reports seems to indicate that these are a very bad investment

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

there are some good answers about the benefits of diversification but i 'm going to go into what is going on mathematically with what you are attempting i was always under the assumption that as long as two securities are less than perfectly correlated i.e. 1 that the standard deviation risk would be less than if i had put 100 into either of the securities while there does exist a minimum variance portfolio that is a combination of the two with lower vol than 100 of either individually this portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio with highest utility under your metric   your metric includes returns not just volatility variance so the different returns bias the result away from the min vol portfolio using the utility function results in the highest utility of 100 vtsax so here the sharpe ratio risk adjusted return of the u.s. portfolio is so much higher than the international portfolio over the period tracked that the loss of returns from adding more international stocks outweigh the lower risk that you would get from both just adding the lower vol international stocks and the diversification effects from having a correlation less than one the key point in the above is over the period tracked   when you do this type of analysis you implicitly assume that the returns risk observed in the past will be similar to the returns risk in the future    certainly if you had invested 100 in the u.s. recently you would have done better than investing in a mix of us intl   however while the risk and correlations of assets can be somewhat stable over time relative returns can vary wildly this uncertainty of future returns is why most people use a diversified portfolio of assets   what is the exact right amount is a very hard question though

a few things for you to consider 1 yes if your average daily balance is lower because you paid it off when you received your paycheck then slowly used the card for the remainder of the month until it 's at the same balance next paycheck vs just having the card at a flat $ 5k the whole month you will accrue less interest thereby allowing you to pay it off faster by reducing your interest payments   but 2 carrying a balance on your credit card is a big financial no no and eliminating it should be an immediate priority for you if there is anything you can do step 1 budget your expenses and then track to see where you stand step 2 see what expenses you can reduce step 3 see if you can increase your income step 4 with your new goals determine how long it would take to pay off the card possibly considering consolidating refinancing your debt at a lower interest rate to pay it off faster then do it however 3 if you have absolutely zero cash on hand then taking your paycheck and immediately paying down your credit card and then relying on that card to pay for things until the next paycheck puts you at risk of your available credit changing ie if you have 5k on the card and pay it down to then what happens to you if the credit card company because they view you as a risk or for whatever other reason including a temporary hold because of fraudulent activity at no fault of your own reduces your available credit to suddenly you will only have $ 250 in available spending power until your next paycheck therefore it may be wise for you to hold onto some amount of cash that you do not touch except for emergencies even before you pay off your credit card i really recommend you search this site for other questions related to budgeting and credit cards there are many good answers and some of what i 've said above is just opinion so you should n't just take my word for it you should try to become familiar with these topics yourself good luck

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

i would go to the bank and just express the concern that the check sent to you might not fully clear you do n't want to spend it until you 're sure it cleared i 'd ask for a manager to tell you when it will clear then confirm after that date that it 's cleared with the same guy   perhaps someone in the industry can explain how long the bank has before deciding the check is bad 10 days 2 weeks really it should either clear or bounce by the second night   i 'd not risk doing this for anyone anyone i know personally can cash their own check and i 'd not get involved with anyone i do n't know on a financial matter like this edit see littleadv comment below good checks clear fast a forged check has time for the victim to go to the bank and challenge the signature and cashing of the check the victim can have 60 days to do this that 's the issue i am wrong the bank manager could n't confirm the check was good so soon

from my reading of the wikipedia page crt this only happens if you deposit or withdraw currency not checks   the idea behind this is that checks ach etc leave paper trails that can be tracked   cash does n't so it gets this extra level of scrutiny   if get a cashiers check or a money order to pay a bill i do n't think a crt is created   if you withdraw $ 15,000 to buy a car in cash 1 stack of $ 100 bills then a crt would be generated   it still is n't a problem as long as you can show a bill of sale showing where the money went or came from if you are the seller the irs has a faq about this   it says taken from several spots at that page cash is money it is currency and coins of the united states and any other country   a cashier ’s check bank draft traveler ’s check or money order with a face amount of more than $ 10,000 is not treated as cash and a business does not have to file form when it receives them these items are not defined as cash because if they were bought with currency the bank or other financial institution that issued them must file a currency transaction report the exception to this is if you are buying something with a resale value of more than $ 10k with a check money order etc of less than $ 10k

after this happened the second time i wonder if there could be a catch on this   no i mean what is my bank 's real motivation for allowing me to spend more money   credit card companies make money in a few ways by giving you a higher limit the credit card company hopes you will spend more on the card this immediately gets them more merchant fees and if they are lucky means you will have to carry the balance for a while earning them interest if they get really lucky you will miss a payment or two earning them some fees of course if they let you borrow too much you might never pay it back so the credit limit is a balancing act letting you borrow more money gives them the potential to make more money but also the potential to lose more money as you build up a history of paying as agreed they feel comfortable lending you more money

disclaimer it 's hard to be definitive as there may be some law or tax rule i 'm not aware of from a uk perspective this should be perfectly legal if it 's just a one off or occasional thing for personal reasons rather than being done in the course of a business there probably are n't any tax implications in theory if there 's an identifiable profit from the transaction e.g. because you originally obtained the inr at a lower exchange rate then you might be liable to capital gains tax however this is only payable above approximately £ 10 k capital gains see so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year you do n't need to worry about that i would only recommend doing this if you trust each other if one side transfers the money and the other does n't the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally even though i think that in theory it should be possible if the sums involved are large you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations or they may want documentation of the source of the funds reason for the transaction this does n't automatically mean you 'll have a problem but the transaction may receive some scrutiny i think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved

as the other answer already states whether you should or should n't currency hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors if you decide to do so depending on your investment vehicles there might be a more cost efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank if you are open to or are already investing in etfs there are currency hedged versions of some popular etfs these are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example if you are buying in and expecting to sell for usd you would buy an etf hedged to usd of course they have a higher expense ratio than non hedged etfs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses

in terms of operations banks are indifferent to inflation short rates except right before a recession or near recession are always lower than long rates regardless of inflation level assuming no quotas or price controls banks produce credit by borrowing short to lend long so as long as short rates are lower than long rates they can be expected to produce loans again assuming no quotas or price controls in short from the banks perspective inflation does not affect their desire to produce credit

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

what is the formula for calculating the total cost of a loan with extra payments towards the principal the formula you require is the standard one for calculating the time to repay   with larger repayments the time to completely repay the loan is reduced where the total cost of the loan is then n d. explanation calculation the formula for a loan is derived from the sum of the cash flows discounted to present value being equal to the principal   for further info see the section here titled calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity the summation can be reduced to a closed form by induction   rearranging for d and n with the op 's figures the original monthly repayment is $ adding $ 200 each month with the higher repayment the loan is repaid in months instead of 360   of course a bank would simply take a reduced payment in month but the amounts work out the same the saving is $ addendum if the repayments increase was made part way through the term of the loan the summation and formula would be   where then for example if for the first ten years the payments are $ and for the remaining time the repayments are $ the loan is completely repaid in months the saving is plotting over a range of m months

in your shoes i would   pay off the mortgage with the after tax investments and be done you have different goals than i do in that you want to keep the debt   so i would   start calling mortgage brokers and asking for someone who does manual underwriting     manual underwriting essentially means they use common sense and look at your situation for what it is instead of saying k means mortgage    it may be that your situation is different enough from mortgage guidelines that you ca n't now get a conforming mortgage i.e. one that is readily re to another mortgage holder    if that is the case you can look for a small bank or credit union that would be interested in adding your loan to their portfolio and not reselling it

the card holder agreement does not explicitly specify a minimum spending requirement it does though have the following catch all clause for closing the account we may    cancel your account    suspend the ability to make charges    cancel or suspend any feature on your account and    notify merchants that your account has been    cancelled or suspended    if we do any of these you must still pay us for all    charges under the terms of this agreement we may do any of these things at our discretion even if you pay on    time and your account is not in default if your account is cancelled    you must destroy your cards we may agree to reinstate your account    after a cancellation if we do this we may reinstate any    additional cards issued on your account charge you any applicable    annual fees and charge you a fee for the account one would suspect that american express would happily collect the fee from anyone who holds the card but is not using it in any way someone though that is n't spending the expected amount of money but is availing themselves of the 24 hour concierge service etc would probably find their privileges revoked and/or their card canceled

considering the combined accounts you 're contributing $ 100 per month and they want $ 100 per year to administer them that 's of your contributions gone to fees each year   to me that 's a definite no   without getting in to bad the adviser for even making the suggestion the scale of your account does n't warrant a fee that high fees are very meaningful to the little fish investors   there are loads of ira account providers   with that level of competition there are several that have very reasonable account minimums no annual maintenance fees and a suite of no fee no load no commission low expense ratio funds to choose from   schwab fidelity and vanguard come to mind   i know schwab is running a big ad campaign right now as it 's reduced some of it 's already low expense ratios if i were you yes i would move the account because you can even get rid of the $ account fee   but no i would not move it to a higher fee situation in my opinion on a $ 3,600 account + $ 1,200 per year in contributions you do n't need advise   you need a good broad market low fee index fund and enough discipline to understand that retirement is 25 years away so you keep contributing even when news is bad and the market is going down   in 10 years maybe talk to an adviser using the s&p500 index daily close historical data from calendar year 2016 considering first of the month monthly deposits and a starting balance of $ 3,600 you would come out at the end of the year with about $   that 's $ in gain on your total contributions of $   they 'd take $ 100 that 's about 20 of your gain   compared to a no fee account with a reasonable expense ratio of 0.1 the fee would be just $   bearing in mind also that your $ 100 per year account will probably be invested in funds that also have an expense ratio fee structure further gains   further you lose the compounding effect of the $ 100 fee over time which adds up to a significant of retirement funds considering a 25 year period   if all you did was put that $ 100 fee in to a 1 savings account each year for 25 years you 'd end up with $ considering the average 7 return of the s&p you 'd have $ on just your $ 100 per year fees this is why you should be so vigilant about fees

i found a way to do this but it 's slightly backwards quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people   but it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses   doing so while including income categories will produce the graph i want but with negative numbers savings is negative spending this will show a bar graph of overall spending counting income as negative spending   so having negative bars is good in this case

so there is no truly correct way to calculate return   professionals will often calculate many different rates of return depending on what they wish to understand about their portfolio   however the two most common ways of calculating multi period return though are time weighted return and money weighted return i 'll leave the details to this good article but the big picture is time weighted returns help you understand how the stock performed during the period in question independent of how you invested it it   whereas money weighted return helps you understand how you performed investing in the stock in question   from your question it appears both methods would be useful in combination to help you evaluate your portfolio both methods should be fairly easy to calculate yourself in a spread sheet but if you are interested there are plenty of examples of both in google docs on the web

i 'm not sure if this answer is going to win me many friends on reddit but here goes   there 's no good reason why they could n't have just told him the current balance shown on their records but   there are some good reasons why they ca n't quote a definitive payoff balance to instantly settle the account   it 's very possible to charge something today and not have it show up on chase 's records until tomorrow or monday or later there are still places that process paper credit card transactions or that deal with 3rd party payment processors who reconcile transactions m f 9 and so on    most transactions these days are authorized the instant you swipe the card and the merchant wo n't process until they get authorization back from the cc company but sometimes those authorizations come from third party processors who do n't bill chase until later some of them might not process a friday afternoon transaction until close of business monday    also there are things like fares that might be collected when you exit the cab but the record exists only in the taxi 's onboard machine until they plug it into something else at the end of the shift    there are still some situations outdoor flea markets auctions etc where the merchant takes a paper imprint and does n't actually process the payment until they physically mail it in or whatever    some small businesses have information security routines in place where only one person is allowed to process credit card payments but where multiple customer service reps are allowed to accept the cc info write it down on one piece of paper then either physically hand the paper to the person with processing rights or deposit the paper in a locked office or mail slot for later processing this is obviously not an instant update system for chase believe it or not this system is actually considered to be more secure than retaining computerized records unless the business has very rigorous end to end info security    so there are a bunch of legit reasons why a cc company ca n't necessarily tell you this instant that you only need to pay $ x and no more to close the account although there is no good reason why they should n't be able to quote your current balance    what happens when you close an account is basically that they stop accepting new charges that were made after your notification but they will still accept and bill you for legit charges that you incurred before you gave them notice so basically they turn off the credit card but they ca n't guarantee how much you owe until the next billing cycle after this one closes   you notify them to close the account they stop authorizing new charges    their merchant agreements basically give the merchant a certain window to process charges the cc company process legit charges that were made prior to closing the account    the cc company sends you the final statement after that window for any charges has expired   when that final statement is paid or if it is zero that is when the account is settled and reported to equifax etc as paid    so it 's hard to tell from your post who was being overly semantic unreasonable if the cc company refused to tell the current balance they were just being but if they refused to promise that the current balance shown is enough to instantly settle the account forever they had legit reasons   hope that helps

you state any info will be appreciated so here 's some background information on my answer you can skip to my answer when i worked for banks i was required to submit suspicious activity to the people above me by filling out a form with a customer 's name ssn account and id   you may hear in media that it is $ 10 k or sometimes $ 5k.   the truth is that it could be lower than that depending on what the institution defines as suspicious   every year we were required to take a course which implied that terrorists and criminals use cash regularly whether we agree or disagree is irrelevant this is what the course implied it 's important to understand that many people use cash only budgets because it 's easier than relying on the banking system which charges overdraft fees for going over or in some cases you pay more at merchants because of card usage some merchants give discounts for cash   if someone has a budget of $ 10 k a month and they choose to use cash that 's perfectly fine   also why is it anyone 's business what someone does with their private property   this created an interesting contrast among differently aged americans older americans saw the banking system as tyrannical whereas young americans did n't care   this is part of why i eventually left the banking system i felt sick that i had to report this information but it 's amazing how quick everyone is to accept the new rules   notice how one of the comments asks you what you intend to do with the money as if it 's any of their business   welcome to the new america my answer if you withdraw $ 100,000 here is what will more than likely happen now watch the anger at this answer because i 'm telling you the truth   this article will explain why   your very question had a negative 1 as if asking what you 're asking is wrong see the absurdity   if joseph stalin ran for president in the united states the majority of americans would welcome him   you have good reason to be concerned others at this site have noticed this as well

from the irs page on estimated taxes emphasis added taxes must be paid as you earn or receive income during the year either through withholding or estimated tax payments if the amount of income tax withheld from your salary or pension is not enough or if you receive income such as interest dividends alimony self employment income capital gains prizes and awards you may have to make estimated tax payments if you are in business for yourself you generally need to make estimated tax payments estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax but other taxes such as self employment tax and alternative minimum tax i think that is crystal clear that you 're paying income tax as well as self employment tax to expand a bit you seem to be confusing self employment tax and estimated tax which are not only two different things but two different kinds of things   one is a tax and the other is just a means of paying your taxes self employment tax refers to the social security and medicare taxes that you must pay on your self employment income   this is an actual tax that you owe   if you receive a w-2 half of it is paid by your employer and half of it is paid by you in the form of visible deductions on your pay stub   if you 're self employed you have to pay all of it explicitly estimated tax does not refer to any actual tax levied on anyone   a more correct phrasing would be estimated tax payment   estimated taxes are just payments that you make to the irs to pay tax you expect to owe   whether you have to make such payments depends on how much tax you owe and whether you 've paid it by other means   you may need to pay estimated tax even if you 're not self employed although this would be unusual   it could happen for instance if you realized large capital gains over the year   you also may be self employed but not need to pay estimated tax if for instance you also have a w-2 job and you reduce your withholding allowances to have extra tax withheld that said if you earn significant income from self employment you 'll likely have to make estimated tax payments   these are prepayments of the income tax and social security medicare taxes you accrue based on your self employment income as pete b. mentioned in his answer a possible reason that your are low is because some taxes have already been withheld from the paychecks you received so far during the year while you were an employee   these represent tax payments you 've already made you do n't need to pay that money a second time but you may need to make estimated tax payments for your income going forward

yes from june 1968 until december 1968 they closed the nyse every wednesday so they could catch up on paperwork representing billions of dollars in transactions   even after the nyse re opened on in january 1969 they still had to close it early at 2 pm for seven more months forbes has a description of this not to be forgotten though is the paperwork crunch in a day of email and the cloud and trading completed in microseconds the idea that wall street needed off in the late to catch up on back office tasks seems especially quaint yet in 1968 the nyse found itself sitting on more than $ 4 billion in transactions trading had risen to 21 million shares daily by contrast even in the heavy volume days in 1929 trading never went above 16 million shares papers stacked on desks a now old joke formed if a fan blew the wrong way in a wall street office visitors below could expect a ticker tape parade everybody agreed that the securities processing system had virtually broken down and the only major point of dispute was who was more responsible for the mess the back offices of the brokerage firms of the stock transfer agents securities and exchange commission commissioner ray jr. said in 1974 some 100 broker dealers failed crumbling under the pressure of fulfilling those back orders the fix an organization akin to the fdic the securities investor protection corporation wall street would stick to the shortened weeks from june to december in january wednesday trading though it ended early at 2 for another seven months

this is a case where human nature and arithmetic lead to different results depending on the your income the effective interest rate on the mortgage is probably right around 2.5   so purely by arithmetic the absolute cheapest way to go is to put the $ 11k to the bigger car loan then pay off the mortgage then the smaller car loan the debt snowball is more effective however because it works better for people progress is demonstrated quickly which maintains and often enhances motivation to continue   i can say as a case in point having tried both methods that if does indeed work   so i am with you pay off the car loan first and roll that payment into the bigger car loan if you add no extra dollars you should get the small loan paid off in 6 to 8 months and the bigger car loan in another 16 to 18 months it sounds like from your message that you have another $ 1500 or so a month   if that is the case small loan paid off in two months bigger loan paid off in another year   if you stick with the ramsay program you then build an emergency fund and start investing good luck

st. john 's church richmond virginia march 23   mr president no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different men often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it will not be thought to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions at such a time through fear of giving offence i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of toward the of heaven which i above all kings   mr. president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that till she us into is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it   i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a to your feet suffer not yourselves to be with a kiss ask yourselves how this reception of our petition with these war like preparations which cover our waters and our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to and humble what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have we have we have we have ourselves before the and have its to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our have been our have produced additional violence and insult our have been disregarded and we have been with contempt from the foot of the in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be if we mean to preserve those privileges for which we have been so long we mean not to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us   they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so an but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally and when a british guard shall be in every house shall we gather strength by and inaction shall we acquire the means of resistance by lying on our backs and hugging the phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who over the of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their may be heard on the plains of boston the war is let it come i repeat it sir let it come   it is in vain sir to the matter gentlemen may cry peace there is no peace the war is actually begun the next that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of arms our are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death   this speech is the best response i can give

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

you sold $ 10,000 worth of stock so that money is essentially yours   however you sold this stock without actually owning any which means that you through your broker are currently borrowing shares amounting to at the time of your sale $ 10,000 from someone who actually owns this stock you will be paying this person interest for the privilege of borrowing their shares the exact amount charged varies wildly and depends on factors such as short interest in the stock loads of people want to go short = shareholders can charge high interest etc if i remember correctly hovering over the position column in your portfolio in the ib should give you information about the interest rate charged   you will have to buy back these shares from the lender at some point which is why the $ 10k is n't just free money if the stock has gone up in price in the meantime you are going to be paying more than the $ 10k you got for the same amount of shares and vice versa

as other responders said you can certainly roll over multiple 401(k into a single account an added benefit of such rollover besides the ease of tracking is that you can shop around for your rollover ira provider and find the one that gives you the specific mutual funds that you want to invest in the lowest expenses etc in short find the best fit to your priorities   there are also lemon 401(k plans and if you are in one of them get out   and rollover is the way out there is also one possibility to keep an eye on as it happens rarely but it does happen rolling a 401(k over into another 401(k   i 've done it once when i started a job at a company that had a great 401(k with a good selection of low cost mutual funds   i rolled the 401(k from one previous job in to this 401(k to take advantage of it   at the same time i kept a rollover ira combining the 401(k from all other jobs it had more investment options and provided some flexibility

disclaimer i am not a banker nor a lawyer i am unaware of the exact term in english there is a process where you can ask for a reversal of a payment if it was made in error and your former employer should have made use of this after a month though i 'm fairly sure the period of eligibility for this reversal has passed   as far as i am aware there is no point in time where it becomes ok for you to take this money if you wish to close the account i would advise contacting the company and obtaining their payment details so you can transfer them the money and subsequently close the account

lots of good answers   i 'll try and improve by being more brief   for each option you will pay different taxes index fund    traditional ira roth ira you can see that the roth ira is obviously better than investing in a taxable account   it may not be as obvious that the traditional ira is better as well   the reason is that in the traditional account you can earn returns on the money that otherwise would have gone to the government today   the government taxes that money at the end but they do n't take all of it in fact for a given investment amount x and returns r the decision of roth vs traditional depends only on your tax rate now vs at retirement because = the left hand side is what you will have at retirement if you do a roth and the right hand side is what you will have at retirement if you do traditional   only the tax rate differences between now and retirment matter here   an index fund investment is like the left hand side but has some additional tax terms on your capital gains   it 's clearly worse than either

you do n't need to submit a k-1 form to anyone but you will need to various entries on the k-1 form that you will receive onto the appropriate lines on your tax return   broadly speaking assets received as a bequest from someone are not taxable income to you but any money that was received by your grandmother 's estate between the time of death and the time of distribution of the assets e.g. interest mutual fund distributions paid in cash etc might be passed on to you in full instead of the estate paying income tax on this income and sending you only the remainder if so this other money would be taxable income to you   the good news is that if the estate trust distributions include stock your basis for the stock is the value as of the date of death i am aware that the estate is allowed to pick a different date for the valuation but i am trying to keep it simple here   that is if the stock has appreciated your grandmother never paid capital gains on those unrealized capital gains and you do n't have to pay tax on those capital gains either your basis is the appreciated value and if and when you sell the stock you pay tax only on the gain if any between the day that grandma passed away and the day you sell the stock

this is more clearly defined in the eitc for purposes of the earned income tax credit then no it is not earned income   see publication page 18 specifically scholarship or fellowship grants not reported on a form a scholarship or fellowship grant that was n't reported to you on a form w-2 is n't considered earned income for the earned income credit further form describes unearned income and explicitly includes scholarships again not on for form unearned income includes all taxable    income other than earned income as defined later    unearned income includes taxable interest ordinary    dividends capital gains including capital gain    distributions rents royalties etc it also includes taxable    social security benefits pension and annuity income    taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on    form w-2 unemployment compensation alimony and    income other than earned income received as the    beneficiary of a trust so unless it was reported on a w-2 i.e. it 's for some sort of employment it 's not considered earned income   h t for that link the definition on the instructions of form is not particularly different though it 's more general earned income includes wages tips and other amounts received for personal services performed   scholarships do n't seem to fit any more into that so i would say they do not

you appear to be thinking of option writers as if they were individuals with small holdings and a particular view on what the underlying is going to do   this is not the best way to think about them option writers are typically large institutions with large portfolios and that provide services in all sorts of different areas at the same time as they are writing calls on a particular stock they are writing puts on it and options on other stocks   they are buying and selling the underlying and all kinds of different derivatives   they are not necessarily writing the option because they are expecting or hoping to benefit from a price move   it 's just small part of their business   they write the option if the option price is good enough that they think they are selling it for very slightly more than it 's worth    asking why an option writer creates a call is like asking why a grocery store keeps buying groceries from their distributors   do n't they know the price of food may not always rise   sure but their business is selling the food for slightly more than they pay for it not speculating on what will happen to its price   most option writers are doing the same thing except what they are buying and selling is sets of cash flows and risk    as a general rule the business model of option writers is to profit from the few cents of spread or mispricing not from aggregate changes in the price of the underlying   they should and often do maintain balanced portfolios so their option writing activities do n't expose them to a lot of risk also note that there could be lots of reasons for writing options even if you do have a particular view   for example perhaps the option writer thinks volatility of the underlying will decrease   writing a call could be part of an overall strategy that profits from this view

you are misunderstanding what makes the price of a stock go up and down every time you sell a share of a stock there is someone else that buys the stock   so it is not accurate to say that stock prices go down when large amounts of the stock are sold and up when large amounts of the stock are bought   every day the amount of shares of a stock that are bought and sold are equal to each other because in order to sell a share of stock someone has to buy it let me try to explain what actually happens to the price of a stock when you want to sell it let 's say that a particular stock is listed on the ticker at $ 100 a share currently   all this means is that the last transaction that took place was for $ 100 someone sold their share to a buyer for $ 100 now let 's say that you have a share of the stock you 'd like to sell   you are hoping to get $ 100 for your share   there are 2 other people that also have a share that they want to sell   however there is only 1 person that wants to buy a share of stock and he only wants to pay $ 99 for a share   if none of you wants to sell lower than $ 100 then no shares get sold   but if one of you agrees to sell at $ 99 then the sale takes place   the ticker value of the stock is now $ 99 instead of $ 100 now let 's say that there are 3 new people that have decided they want to buy a share of the stock   they 'd like to buy at $ 99 but you and the other person left with a share want to sell at $ 100   either one of the sellers will come down to $ 99 or one of the buyers will go up to $ 100   this process will continue until everyone that wants to sell a share has sold and everyone who wants to buy a share has bought   in general though when there are more people that want to sell than buy the price goes down and when there are more people that want to buy than sell the price goes up to answer your question if your selling of the stock had caused the price to go down it means that you would have gotten less money for your stock than if it had not gone down   likewise if your buying the stock had caused it to go up it just means that it would have cost you more to buy the stock   it is just as likely that you would lose money doing this rather than gain money

this is an old question that has an accepted answer but it has gotten bumped due to an edit and the answers given are incorrect i am assuming this means that every other friday the company is going into the open public market buying those shares and then giving it out to the employees no companies will internally hold shares that it intends to offer employees as additional compensation there are no open market transactions so the market price of the stock does not change at least not due to buying pressure   the only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses these share may come through an initial buyback from the market but more common is that when companies issue new shares they keep some internally for exactly this situation   if they issued new shares every pay period it would dilute the existing shares several times a quarter which would be difficult to account for

furthermore in 2003 when the nissan plant expanded in ms suburb of jackson which is a very similar job market to al three times as many people focus f keep in mind that the job market was pretty good in jackson at the time basically they open these plants in the south where labor is cheap and union strength is low for the applicants one of these jobs could be the key to a better future due to a pay rate that is much higher than the local average not only is this the case for uneducated and unskilled workers but it is even attractive to those who are educated and likely underpaid due to the economics of the region   tl;dr nothing to see good jobs are available the queue goes around the block

i think a lot of highly educated people fall victim to keeping up with the not everyone that is in their same position comes from the same background for example a co worker with an mba from may have no student loan debt because his lawyer doctor parents paid for it while another co worker with an mba from university of phoenix may be getting crushed with loan repayments   however assuming that they both make the same salary one will look to the other to set an example of what houses cars other things people in this salary range buy salary and social pressures sometimes outweigh financially sound decisions

i think people are missing the most obvious thing   the yearly rate increases are just part of the landlord and it is good business for them   my grandmother owned several large apartment complexes   she would raise rates for any resident that had been there between 1 5 years by 5 7 a year   even when she had vacancies and property values did n't go up   for the following reasons so yes it is not only normal but just part of the business   if there are better apartments for less money i suggest you move there   soon those other apartments will even out and if they are better they will be much more   so if you see a gap take advantage of it   if you would rather stay then simply say you will not pay the increase   there is no use arguing about why   the landlord will either be ok with it or say no   probably the biggest factors include whether you will tell other tenants or their perception if you would and how good of a tenant risk they feel you are

you and your husband are fronting all the money upfront i 'm guessing this will cost you around once closing costs and fees are included so obviously you would be hundred percent owners at the beginning you 'll then pay 31 of the mortgage and have your sister pay the remaining 69 this puts your total investment at the end at + + 31 of interest accrued and your sisters total investment at of interest accrued if you hold the full length of the mortgage your sister will have invested much more than you assuming 30 year fixed rate and 3.75 she 'd pay in interest as opposed to your she will have spent and y' all will have spent however if you sell early your percentage could be much higher   these calculations do n't take into account the opportunity cost of fronting all the cash it could be earning you more in the stock market or in a different investment property liability also could be an issue in the case of her not being able to pay the bank can still come after you for the whole amount lastly and most importantly this also does n't include the fact that she will be living there and y' all will not what kind of rent would she be paying to live in a similar home if it is more than 1400 you will basically be subsidizing her living as well as tying up funds and increasing your risk exposure if it is more than 1400 she should n't be any percent owner

if you 're refinancing a conforming fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage do n't go with an fha try a harp refinance which wo n't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value harp also limits the risk based pricing adjustments that can be charged so your rate should be very competitive with an fha mortgage even once you get the loan to value ratio down to 80 percent you still have mortgage insurance for several years plus the upfront costs in your case i think it 's a bad deal

i have been a landlord in texas for just over 3 years now i still feel like a novice but i will give you the benefit of my experience if you are relying on rental properties for current income versus a long term return you are going to have to do a good job at shopping for bargains to get monthly cash flow versus equity growth that is locked up in the property until you sell it   if you want to pull a lot of cash out of a property on a regular basis you probably are going to have to get into flipping them which is decidedly not passive investing also it is easy to underestimate the expenses associated with rental properties texas is pretty landlord friendly legally however it does have higher than usual property taxes which will eat into your return also you need to factor in maintenance vacancy tenant turnover costs etc it can add up to a lot more than you would expect if you are handy and can do a lot of repairs yourself you can increase your return but that makes it less of a passive investment the two most common rules i have heard for initially evaluating whether an investment property is likely to be cash flow positive are the 1 and 50 rules the 1 rule says the expected monthly rent needs to be 1 or greater of the purchase price of the house so your hypothetical $ k scenario does n't pass that test some people say this rule is 2 for new landlords but in my experience you 'd have to get lucky in texas to find a house priced that competitively that did n't need a lot of work to get rents that high the 50 rule says that the rent needs to be double your mortgage payment to account for expenses you also have to factor in the hassle of dealing with tenants the following are not going to happen when you own a mutual fund but are almost inevitable if you are a landlord long enough for whatever reason you have to go to court and evict a tenant a tenant that probably lost their job or had major medical issues the tenant you ever met with the kids in the world that you are threatening to make homeless every fiber of your being wants to cut them some slack but you have a mortgage to pay and ca n't set an expectation that paying the rent on time is a suggestion not a rule or the tenant who seemed nice at first but now considers you the man decides to fight the eviction and wo n't move out you have to go through a court process then eventually get the sheriff to come out and forcibly remove them from the property which they are treating like crap because they are mad at you all the while not paying rent or letting you re let the place the tenant is n't maintaining the lawn and the hoa is getting on your butt about it do you pay someone to mow the grass for them and then try to squeeze the money out of the tenant who never agreed to pay for that   you rent to a college kid who has never lived on their own and has adopted you as their new parent figure the light in the closet went out can you come replace the bulb tenants flat out lying to your face of course i do n't have any pets that i did n't pay the deposit for pics all over facebook of their kids playing with a dog in the pet free house

i 'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question since i think you meant to use $ 10,000 as the value of the futures contract and $ 3 as the value of the underlying stock those numbers would make more sense that being said i can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract for the sake of simplicity i 'll use a well known futures contract the e mini s&p500 contract each e mini is worth $ 50 times the value of the s&p 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25 so the minimum price change is 0.25 $ 50 = $ 12.50   here 's an example say the current value of the s&p500 is 1,600 the value of each contract is therefore $ 50 1,600 = $ 80,000 you purchase one contract on margin with an initial margin of 5 or $ 4,000 if the s&p 500 index rises to the value of your futures contract increases to $ 50 = $ once you return the 80,000 4,000 = $ that you borrowed as leverage your profit is = $ 4,500   since you used $ 4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin your profit excluding commissions is 4,500 4,000 = $ 500 which is a = 12.5 return if the index dropped to the value of your futures contract decreases to $ 50 = $ after you return the $ in leverage you 're left with $ 3,000 or a net loss of 3,000 = the math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk but also increases your potential for return consider the first scenario in which the index increases to if you had forgone using margin and spent $ 80,000 of your own funds your profit would be 80,000 = this is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20 the inverse of the margin requirement .05 = 12.5 in this case the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return   however in the case of a decrease you spent $ 80,000 but gained $ for a loss of only 1.25 this is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage by forgoing leverage you 've decreased your opportunity for upside but also decreased your downside risk 1 for futures contracts the margin requirements are set by the exchange which is cme group in the case of the e mini the 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement which is currently $ usd per contract but it keeps the numbers simple also note that cme group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead

most of those countries had debt that was well beyond prudent levels of gdp before the crisis levels such that any crisis would put them over the safe limit and into trouble the only exception was spain whose debt levels were still marginally dangerous greece was off the charts which is why they left off the graph for greece   second problem on top of the high or marginal levels of government debt the governments implicitly or explicitly guaranteed the banks without limiting in any effective way their levels of leverage and risk basel ii a lot of paper that made no difference protip if someone guarantees your debt they should be able to oversee your level of risk but the governments did n't   as a result these banks and their ceos in particular have a bet that goes heads i win tails i win and you the taxpayer lose if the loans are paid off the ceos rake in millions if the loans go bad the government bails them out and the ceos and other top executives you guessed it rake in millions of course when faced with these incentives the banks will lend too much   this is not free market capitalism it is crony capitalism bailouts of private companies are not part of unfettered free market capitalism   the third problem is that the same governments can not print money like the us can because the euro is not owned by the individual governments    the answer to excessive levels of government debt is for governments not to borrow too much and not to take on excessive unfunded liabilities such as pensions this probably needs to be enforced by a constitutional amendment so it ca n't be easily   the answer to governments getting dragged into bailing out insolvent banks and then going under themselves is to allow the banks to go under and to guarantee only small deposits let shareholders bond holders and large lenders to the banks to lose their money second hold bank executives and shareholders liable for the bank 's debts eg executive salaries and other remuneration need to be clawed back up to a 5 year window shareholders should be liable as they used to be for debts up to an additional 100 of the par value of the shares i can assure you this would concentrate minds wonderfully as it did in the old days when wall st investment banks were partnerships with each partner liable for all the debts of the firm   another alternative would be for governments to enforce limits on financial risk but unfortunately they do not have the courage to do this nor the morality to resist campaign contributions bribes to look the other way   if these steps were taken the issue of the euro currency would not be a problem however printing money which requires having your own currency is a solution if it comes to that although it comes at the expense of people who have saved and invested prudently printing money keeping interest rates excessively low for years on end subsidizes borrowers the ones who created the problem at the expense of savers clearly this creates terribly perverse incentives the next time around   anyone who thinks this problem is a result of unfettered free market capitalism is not paying attention

this answer will expand a bit on the theory a company as an entity represents a pile of value some of that is business value the revenue stream from their products and some of that is assets real estate manufacturing equipment a patent portfolio etc one of those assets is cash if you own a share in the company you own a share of all those assets including the cash in a theoretical sense it does n't really matter whether the company holds the cash instead of you if the company adds an extra $ 1 billion to its assets then people who buy and sell the company will think hey there 's an extra $ 1 billion of cash in that company i should be willing to pay $ 1 billion shares outstanding more per share to own it than i would otherwise granted you may ultimately want to turn your ownership into cash but you can do that by selling your shares to someone else from a practical standpoint though the company does n't benefit from holding that cash for a long time cash does n't do much except sit in bank accounts and earn small amounts of interest and if you wanted pathetic amounts of interests from your cash you would n't be owning shares in a company you 'd have it in a bank account yourself really the company should do something with their cash usually that means investing it in their own business to grow and expand that business or to enhance profitability sometimes they may also purchase other companies if they think they can turn a profit from the purchase sometimes there are n't a lot of good options for what to do with that money in that case the company should say i ca n't effectively use this money in a way which will grow my business you should go and invest it yourself in whatever sort of business you think makes sense that 's when they pay a dividend you 'll see that a lot of the really big global companies are the ones paying dividends places like coca cola or exxon mobil or what have you they just ca n't put all their cash to good use even after their growth plans many people who get dividends will invest them in the stock market again possibly purchasing shares of the same company from someone else or possibly purchasing shares of another company it does n't usually make a lot of sense for the company to invest in the stock market themselves though investment expertise is n't really something most companies are known for and because a company has multiple owners they may have differing investment needs and risk tolerance for instance if i had a bunch of money from the stock market i 'd put it in some sort of growth stock because i 'm twenty something with a lot of savings and years to go before retirement if i were close to retirement though i would want it in a more stable stock or even in bonds if i were retired i might even spend it directly so the company should let all its owners choose unless they have a good business reason not to sometimes companies will do share buy backs instead of dividends which pays money to people selling the company stock the remaining owners benefit by reducing the number of shares outstanding so they own more of what 's left they should only do this if they think the stock is at a fair price or below a fair price for the company otherwise the remaining owners are essentially giving away cash this actually happens often on the other hand if the company 's stock is depressed but it subsequently does better than the rest of the market then it is a very good investment the one nice thing about share buy backs in general is that they do n't have any immediate tax implications for the company 's owners they simply own a stock which is now more valuable and can sell it and pay taxes on that sale whenever they choose

first i would recommend getting rid of this ridiculous debt or remember this day and this answer you will be living this way for many years to come and maybe worse no not enough retirement   hold off on any retirement savings right now so that the money can be used to crush this debt without knowing all of your specifics health insurance deductions etc and without any retirement contribution given $ 190,000 you should probably be taking home around $ 12,000 per month total   assuming a $ 2,000 mortgage payment 30 year term that is $ 10,000 left per month   if you were serious about paying this off you could easily live off of $ 3,000 per month probably less and have $ 7,000 left to throw at the student loan debt   this assumes that you have n't financed automobiles especially expensive ones or have other significant debt payments that 's around 3 years until the entire $ 300,000 is paid i have personally used and endorse the snowball method pay off smallest to largest regardless of interest rate though i did adjust it slightly to pay off some debts first that had a very high monthly payment so that i would then have this large payment to throw at the next debt after the debt is gone you now have the extra $ 7,000 per month probably more if you get raises bonuses etc to enjoy and start saving for retirement and kid 's college   you may have 20 25 years to save for retirement at $ 4,000 per month that 's $ 1 million in just savings not including the growth with moderate growth this could easily double or more   you 'll also have about 14 years to save for college for this one kid at $ 1,500 per month that 's $ 250,000 not including investment growth this is probably overkill for one kid so adjust accordingly then there 's at least $ 1,500 per month left to pay off the mortgage in less than half the time of the original term so in this scenario conservatively you might have obviously i do n't know your financials or circumstances so build a good budget and play with the numbers   if you sacrifice for a short time you 'll be way better off trust me from experience as a side note   assuming the loan debt is 50/50 you and your husband you made a good investment and he made a poor one   unless he is a public or charity attorney why is he making $ 60,000 when you are both attorneys and both have huge student loan debt   if it were me i would consider a job change   at least until the debt was cleaned up   if he can make $ 100,000 to $ 130,000 or more then your debt may be gone in under 2 years   then he can go back to the charity gig

say for example a trade totals $ 10,000   a flat tax of 0.2 would be $ 20   this is not much for the buy amp holder b c he only makes a few trades a year say 10 transactions a year   so their tax is only about $ 200 per year heck we could even drop it to 0.1   but will routinely do 10 trades a day or over 3000 trades a year   so using that same 10 k trade above that could hypothetically be = $ 60,000 per year in taxes   computer traders will do hundreds of trades per day   say 30,000 trades per year   so that is $ 600,000   so you can see how hardly affects legitimate investors while making the hf traders control themselves a bit   this is what we want   the exchanges charge the flat tax with the transaction like a sales tax   it avoids excess regulation the sec already monitors trades or is supposed to and it hurts the gamblers hfts while not the good guys investors

you 're welcome good questions on a confusing topic let me see if i can unpack it a bit try to clear up the way accrual accounting and   gt   i buy an airline today i get to recognize the revenue from any pre sold tickets starting tomorrow and reduce my deferred revenue liability   hmm are you sure that 's the case does purchasing the business somehow cause those future events to resolve   i could be way off base here so let me know if i 'm missing something but whenever an airline ticket is purchased in advance it 's a balance sheet issue cash is increased and there is a liability created for deferred revenue the revenue hits the income statement only when the flight takes place as you noted this would be accompanied with the usual of costs and expenses etc   gt   however i do n't get that cash as it has already been paid to the previous owner   sure you do their bank account is now yours right i imagine that buying an airline company would be a matter of transferring ownership rather than to resolve any underlying uncertainty in the recognition of earnings yeah   as for valuation it may depend on if you 're looking at the income statement in isolation and relying on eps or if you 're using a more integrated approach with the balance sheet which would bring these sorts of developments to light   does that help any part still clear as mud   edit words

you can do on both market and limit orders normal market orders will partial fill if you want more shares than are being offered or if someone pulled their order before you get there and now there are fewer shares than you placed a trade for with a limit order not at the you are shooting in the dark for a quick match most of the time it does not fill   this is a commonly used order type for arbitrage   some exchanges will not attempt to cross it for a match if its price is not at or better than the market price when the limit order is at the it is essentially a market order    fyi sometimes you have a minimum quantity to fill option so you can let the order sit on the book until it fills or you cancel

unless and until you are ready to do the ground work and get your hands dirty in the market it is better to let the money where it is but how to distribute money in which asset classes industry etc is your choice to make but remember that a big investment company does n't guarantee that you will always earn a return higher than the market or it is safe with them they are also bound to make mistakes and go bust but it would be quite rare for companies with billions of assets because they have strict checks in place and invest with extreme caution and proper research one option is to try in the markets yourself slowly not everything at once you will learn a lot and there are loads of information on the net and books in stores which could get you started you will need to do a lot of to beat the market that is difficult but not impossible people have done it time and time again and they have put in hard work to do so and i do n't see with a little bit of work and time why you should n't be able to do that unless and until you are lazy and do n't intend to do it

if it opens below my limit order   what exactly are you trying to achieve here if your limit order is for 100 and the stock opens below your limit order say 99 then it is obviously going to buy it automatically   also place a stop loss on the same order   most brokers allow limit + stop loss order at the same time on same order   what i conclude from your question is that you 're with a broker that is using obscure technology get a better broker or maybe phrasing your question correctly

you can split payments and nobody judges you because most prepaid cards are actually gift cards   they just think you have generous friends    when you use visa mc at a vendor they get dinged around 2 3 plus 35 cents flat rate   so when you ask them to charge 77 cents to the card you 're essentially asking they give half of it to visa mc   which is unfair   a charity wo n't turn it down but it 's wasted   so how do you solve this problem   if you see a small merchant using square or paypal here their merchant agreements charge a flat rate 2.75 and respectively with no flat rate per transaction   if you see they are on paypal square go for it    obviously paypal itself does n't have that problem because they have a really really good deal with visa and mastercard   so feel free to buy yourself credit on your paypal account with these residual values    amazon probably has a similar deal    you are getting these small amounts because you aim to pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 25 on it   reasonable but it causes this    flip it around pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 20 on it consume the $ 20 value and pay the $ in cash   you may need to tell the cashier exactly the amount to charge e.g. $ 20.00 especially if it is a visa mc card   it will certainly go faster if you do   the cashier may be able to pull up the balance but it 's an extra procedure and an inexperienced cashier may struggle with it have to call the manager etc not worth it in my book

you would need to check with bank as it varies from bank to bank   you can break the fd 's generally you do n't loose the interest you have earned for 1 years however the rate of interest will be reduced i.e. if the rate was 7 for 1 year fd and 8 for 2 years fd when you break after a year you will get only 7 generally this can happen in few hours but definitely in 2 days you can get a loan against fd 's generally the rate of interest is 2 higher than fd rate there is also initial processing fee etc check with the bank it may take few days to set things up

you have to understand what risk is and how much risk you want to take on and weight your portfolio accordingly   i think your 80/20 split based on wrong assumptions is the wrong way to look at it   it sounds like your risk appetite has changed risk is deviation from expected so risk is not bad and you can have cases where everyone would prefer the riskier asset    if you think the roulette table is too risky instead of betting $ 1 stick in your pocket and you changed the payoffs from $ 2 or 0 to or $ 1.50 if your risk appetite has changed change your risk exposure   if not then all you are saying is i bought the wrong stuff earlier now i should get out

there are lots of reasons why a crook would want you to do this counterfeit check scam laundering money trying to get your account information getting you used to doing questionable things and then escalating seeing whether you 're the kind of person to go along with bad ideas etc   there are not however much in the way of good reasons for it i gather you can withdraw money from your bank without an atm fee this i am assuming from the fact that it is being proposed that you withdraw money from your account and the fact that this is how pretty much all non predatory banking works if this person 's bank wo n't let them withdraw money without a fee something is seriously wrong and they should get an account at your bank do they get charged for using a live teller as well if not how is getting money from you easier than getting it from a teller how much is the fee if the fee is $ 2 and you 're making $ 10/hour that 's 12 minutes of wages does it take less than 12 minutes to complete this transaction including the time this other person is spending this cartoon comes to mind

that 's a loaded question   economists ca n't even agree on an answer from a purely economic point of view   i will say this   i think that many people who are advocating radical cutbacks in spending republicans and tea partiers are themselves in two important ways   1 that it 's possible to balance the budget without raising revenues   i do n't think very many economists agree with this premise   even paul ryan 's plan to balance the budget should one take a hard look at the number clearly show how impossible it is   there would either have to be tax hikes or we slash the military to a fraction of its size now and leave no money for pretty much anything else like roads highways air traffic control food safety inspections education farm subsidies oil subsidies etc   2 more importantly i think there is an implicit and fundamental belief among right that the world will somehow stop what it 's doing while the us balances its budget   the belief goes that once we are fiscally healthy we will remain a superpower and ruling the world like we have for 100 years   this is fundamentally wrong   i think most people even tea partiers fail to appreciate how fundamentally important america 's debt has been to our history   we have essentially borrowed our way into power   should the right win the day and put in place radical cuts in spending america 's economic political diplomatic cultural and military influence around the world will be among to go   the dollar will and so will our standards of living   our gdp will not be able to support a a political economy that can maintain superpower status   now i do not mean to say that i do not agree with the right   from a purely economic point of view they may very well be right   i 'm not even sure there is an option   in fact a part of me is ready to accept america becoming what france and the uk are now still having relatively good standards of living but nowhere near the height of their historical powers   maybe the world will be better for it   i just do n't think tea partiers appreciate the ultimate result of what they want to see happen

your first step should be to visit with the financial aid office of the university that you are considering attending perhaps even before filling out the fafsa you may be eligible for grants scholarships and subsidized loans as well as unsubsidized loans you should pursue the first two options first and then when you know how much remains to be financed we can evaluate which of your investments you might liquidate if further financing is needed there are a range of views on debt on this board i take a very cautious approach to going in to debt i worked full time and took night classes to finish my degree without debt but depending on your program that might not be an option it seems that you also have a healthy relationship with debt considering the shape of your savings and finances as outlined above apart from the above information about how much money could be obtained and at what interest rates the other missing information is your current salary and your expected salary range after completing the program with all of that information i could make specific recommendations but at this point my only recommendation is to avoid liquidating any retirement accounts in your effort to invest in yourself if at all possible

dollar cost averaging is a great strategy to use for investment vehicles where you ca n't invest it in a lump sum a 401 k is perfect for this you take a specific amount out of each paycheck and invest it either in a single   fund or multiple funds or some programs let you invest it in a brokerage account so you can invest in virtually any mutual fund or stock with annual or semi annual re balancing of your investments dollar cost averaging is the way to invest in these programs if you have a lump sum to invest then dollar cost averaging is not the best way to invest imagine you want to invest 10 k and you want to be 50 bonds and 50 stocks under dollar cost averaging you would take months to move the money from 100 cash to 50/50 bonds stocks while you are slowly moving towards the allocation you want you will spend months not in the allocation you want you will spend way too long in the heavy cash position you were trying to change the problem works the other way also somebody trying to switch from stocks to gold a few years ago would not have wanted to stay in limbo for months obviously day traders do n't use dollar cost averaging if you will will be a frequent trader dca is not the way to go   no particular stock type is better for dca it is dependent on how long you plan on keeping the investment and if you will be working with a lump sum or not edit there have be comments regarding dca and 401ks when experts discuss why people should invest via a 401 k they mention dca as a plus along with the company match many participants walk away with the belief that dca is the best strategy many articles have been written about how to invest an inheritance or tax refund many people want to use dca because they believe that it is good in fact in the last few years the experts have begun to discourage ever using dca unless there is no other way

are you doing the right thing yes paying back some of the expense of college is a great way to show your gratitude could your sister also pitch in a little to help pay the debt down will you get approved for a $ 30,000 unsecured loan you do n't mention your credit rating but that will have an effect obviously you might consider visiting a credit union with your father and co signing a loan since it is his debt that you are assuming you might still want to write a loan for your dad to sign even if he is n't co signed on a loan this could protect you in case of his death if there are other assets to divide if you are not approved for a loan you could also simply join your dad in paying down the highest rate cards first and have a loan agreement for him to pay back that money if when it is possible you 've mentioned that you have no collateral there are n't many options for loans with no collateral your dad 's bank or a credit union might consider a debt consolidation loan with you as a co signer that 's why i mentioned going to a credit union talking to a loan officer at a local financial institution will make it easier to get approved if they see that you are taking responsible steps to pay off the debt that reduces your credit risk if you do get a debt consolidation loan they will probably ask your dad to close some credit card accounts

in double entry bookkeeping no transaction is ever negative you only deal in positive numbers we simulate negative numbers by calling numbers debits and credits where one is the negative of the other only a balance can be negative in this case income is a credit account that means that things that increase your balance are credits and things that reduce your balance are debits so a gift from grandma is a credit it 's a positive number and you write it in the credit column you pretty much never subtract from income except to correct a mistake assets like a checking account are debit accounts increases are debits and decreases are credits you routinely have both debits and credits on a checking account i.e. you put money in and you take money out every transaction affects at least two accounts one with a debit and one with a credit so in this case the gift from grandma credits income and debits checking buying food credits checking and debits expenses

this article is a great support for the la diet the author argues that your body has a target weight it wants to be at and will stimulate you into maintaining that weight he goes on to say that by consuming calories one source given is extra light olive oil you convince your body to reduce it 's target weight making it possible to eat less and not be hungry i can vouch that following the extra light olive oil routine definitely makes you less hungry but you still have to have the discipline to not eat when you 're not hungry one drawback is that you have to keep following the routine even after you lose weight one interesting point is that the la method worked really well for people with disabilities

ignoring the complexities of a and regulated market a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party a to buy a given amount of a commodity from party b at a specified price the future can be over something tangible like pork or oil in which case there is a physical transfer of stuff or it can be over something intangible like shares the purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to lock in a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day in many cases the buyer actually wants the stuff futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example the farmer who is growing say wool will enter a contract to supply 3000 kg at $ 10 per kg of a given quality etc there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months the spot price today may be $ 11 the farmer gives up $ 1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer when the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000 kg and takes the money if he has failed to grow at least 3000 kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are for futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same say the contract is for 1000 shares of xyz stock party a agrees to sell these for $ 10 each on a given day to party b. when that day rolls around party a transfers the shares and gets the money party a may have owned the shares all along may have bought them before the settlement day or if push comes to shove must buy them on the day of settlement notwithstanding when they bought them if they paid less than $ 10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss   generally speaking you ca n't settle a futures contract with another futures contract you have to deliver up what you promised be it wool or shares

yes you can trade your properties go to the county recorder 's office to find out the exact procedure deeds generally have specific language to use and you must describe the property accurately in the deed if you want to do the transfer yourself you will need to make sure you have the language correct also you might want to do a title search to make sure that there are no claims against the property your brother is trading you such as by a lender who might have loaned money to him with the property as collateral 3 yes the normal way in the us is quitclaim deeds 4 a quitclaim deed only lists the money or other consideration that changes hands 5 since it is a trade for equal value there are no taxes 6 no normally a lawyer is only needed if you are dealing with a stranger and the transaction is complex as long as you follow the procedures of the clerk 's office correctly there should be no need for a lawyer in fact a lawyer might be undesirable because they could slow things down also since this is a non standard trade a lawyer actually has a higher chance of screwing something up because they will not give it long thought the way you would also they will use and mail instead of actually going to the office another source of error which you can avoid by doing the process correctly ie visiting the office lawyers do n't like getting out of their chairs and this causes them to make a lot of mistakes

the stock market 's principal justification is matching investors with investment opportunities   that 's only reasonably feasible with long term investments   high frequency traders are not interested in investments they are interested in buying cheap and selling expensive   holding reasonably robust shares for longer binds their capital which is one reason the faster paced business of dealing with options is popular instead   so their main manner of operation is off actually investments by letting the investors pay more than the recipients of the investments receive by now the majority of stock market business is indirect and tries guessing where the money goes rather than where the business goes for one thing this leads to the stock market 's evaluations being largely inflated over the actual underlying committed deals happening   and as the commitment to an investment becomes rare the market becomes more volatile and it 's money running in circles fast trading is about running in front of where the money goes anticipating the market   but if there is no actual market to anticipate only people running before the imagination of other people running before money the net payout to zero as the ratio of serious actual investments in tangible targets declines by and large high frequency trading to a ponzi scheme and you try being among the winners of such a scheme   but there are a whole lot of people competing here and essentially the net payoff is close to zero due to the large volumes in circulation as opposed to what ends up in actual tangible investments it 's a completely different game with different rules riding on the original idea of a stock market   so you have to figure out what your money should be doing according to your plans

the trader has purchased options each of which is a contract which entitles him to sell 100 shares of cisco stock for $ 16 a share he paid $ 71 for each contract 71 cents a share x 100 which is roughly $ total he will get $ for each dollar below $ 16 cisco 's stock is when he exercises it he can buy the stock for the going rate and then sell it for $ 16 immediately or he can sell the option itself to someone else for a similar gain usually a little more especially if the option has a long time until it expires if the option expires when the stock is over $ he gets nothing i.e. the original $ is lost for reference cisco 's stock was trading at $ as of market close on march 18 2010 the share price had recently been boosted by the recent news that they would be paying a quarterly dividend it has been heading mostly downward since february 9 after they announced that they 're not expecting profits to be as good as the analysts thought they would be they claim that people are n't buying too much networking equipment just now and they 're also facing mounting competition from the likes of hp and for switches and aruba hp motorola for wireless devices they may lose market share or need to cut prices hurting profits either way there 's certainly a real possibility of their stock going below $ 16 in the next few months so people are willing to pay for those options disclosure i work for aruba who competes with cisco i also own shares of aruba possess stock options and similar equity grants and participate in the employee stock purchase program   i also own shares in cisco indirectly through various mutual funds and etfs

this would depend on what transfer methods your forex broker allows most will allow you to have a check or wire transfer sent best thing would be to call email your broker and ask how to get the money into your account keep in mind many brokers will force you to withdraw using the same funding method you used to deposit up to the amount of the deposit for example if i fund my forex account with $ 500 on a credit card and make $ 500 profit i now have $ 1,000 sitting in my forex account the broker will force me to withdraw $ 500 as a credit to my credit card before allowing me to use another withdrawal method this is an anti money laundering precaution

as other people have posted starting with fictional money is the best way to test a strategy learn about the platform you are using etc that being said i would about how fundamental analysis works fundamental analysis is the very basis of learning about an assets true value is priced however in my humble opinion i personally just stick with index funds in layman 's terms index funds are essentially computer programs that buy or sell the underlying assets based on the index they are associated with in the portion of the underlying index therefore you will usually be doing as good or as bad as the market i personally have the background education and skillsets to build very complex models to do fundamental analysis but even i invest primarily in index funds because a well made and well researched stock model could take 8 hours or more and modern portfolio theory would suggest that most investors will inevitably have a regression to the mean and have gains equal to the market rate or return over time which is what an index fund already does but without the hours of work and transaction cost

what other cities can offer in a tight package detroit can only offer if are accept major compromises and hour drives    detroit proper is exceptionally weak on the talent amazon needs so you have to include the suburbs even then it 's nowhere near the most educated metro so then you have to start saying but ann that 's close to an hour away in traffic    detroit can offer land but there are all sorts of issues with it as locals are well aware high taxes high crime remediation needed plus the schools are poor so many would end up living deep in the suburbs and driving to work rather than walking or riding transit   the airport is another issue it 's an ok airport but it 's about as convenient as denver 's it 's not convenient    transit as you mentioned is another issue transit in detroit is absolutely sub par    no matter how you weigh the priorities detroit always ends up weaker than one or more of the alternatives add to that the reality that many people do not want to move to or live in detroit   be on par with most other   this is what locals want to believe but many also seem to be of the wrong opinion that detroit will be up to the level of seattle in a handful of years detroit is nowhere near competitive at this point

for your base question yes   barring some major collapse of civilization event but in that case you 're screwed anyway   on the individual points 1 depends on whether you choose to invest in index type funds where profit is mainly expected from price appreciation or more value based investing   but either or a mix of the two my own choice should show returns above inflation over the long term 2 yes in the us anyway   you can invest a few hundred dollars at a time and with good companies like vanguard t. rowe price there are no transaction fees either for investing or for redeeming    3 long term it 's crash proof if you have the self discipline not to panic sell at market lows   in my case my total fund valuation dropped around 40 in 08   i did n't sell anything and in fact tried to cut spending and invest more and now i have nearly double what i had before the crash bottom line is that it has worked for me   after ~30 years of investing this way without being fanatic about it i have enough that i could live moderately without working for the rest of my life   not and this is where i part company with mmm and most of the fire community that i 'd ever want to actually retire   but my modest financial independence gives me the freedom to work at things i like rather than because i 'm worrying about paying bills

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

there are two parts to this firstly if you are also living in the property you have bought then you should not consider it to be an investment you need it to provide shelter and the market value is irrelevant unless until you decide to move of course if your move is forced at a time not of your choosing then if the market value has dropped you might lose out no one can accurately predict the housing market any more than they can predict interest rates on normal savings accounts the movement of the stock market etc   secondly if you just have a lump sum and you want to invest it safely the bank is one of the safest places to keep it it is protected underwritten by eu law assuming you are in the eu up to € 100,000 see for example here which is about the uk and brexit in particular but mentions the eu blanket protection the other things you could do with it buy property gold art works stocks and shares whatever thing you think will be least likely to lose value over time would not be protected in the same way

i think the $ 500 mm number was bullshit a common trick is that a private company will raise $ 50 mm for 10 of the company and say they 're worth $ 500 mm but then it turns out that the new investors get like they 're guaranteed to be paid back first if the company goes bankrupt or they 're guaranteed to get back the first $ 100 mm of an ipo since the company really sold 10 of itself plus other stuff they are worth less than $ 500 mm    therefore i find 's claim that reddit was worth $ 250 mm in 2015 credible it is also why i 'm suspicious about the $ number today

based on the statement in your question you think it should have been on the 2014 w-2 but it was included on the 2015 w-2 if you are correct then you are asking them to correct two w-2 forms the 2014 form and the 2015 form you will also have to file form for 2014 to correct last years tax forms you will have to pay additional tax with that filing and there could be penalties and interest but if you directed them on the last day of the year it is likely that the transaction actually took place the next year you will have to look at the paperwork for the account to see what is the expected delay you should also be able to see from the account history when it actually took place and when the funds were credited to your account   or you could just pay the tax this year this might be the best if there is no real difference in the result now if you added the sale to your taxes year without a corresponding tax statement from your account that is a much more complex situation the irs could eventually flag the discrepancy so you may have to adjust last year filing anyway

with your windfall you 've been given a second chance you 've become debt free again and get to start over here is what i would recommend from this point on decide that you want to remain debt free it sounds like you 've already done this since you are asking this question commit to never borrowing money again it sounds overly simplistic but if you stop using your credit cards to spend money you do n't have and you do n't take out any loans you wo n't be in debt   learn to budget here is what is going to make being debt free possible at the beginning of each month you are going to write down your income for the month then write down your expenses for the month make sure you include everything you 'll have fixed monthly expenses like rent and variable monthly expenses like electricity and phone you 'll also have ongoing expenses like food transportation and entertainment you 'll have some expenses like tuition which does n't come up every month but is predictable and needs to be paid for these you 'll can set aside part of the money for the expense each month and when the bill comes you 'll have the funds to pay it ready to go using budgeting software such as ynab which i recommend will make this whole process much easier you are allowed to change your plan if you need to at any time but do not allow yourself to spend any money that is not in the plan   take action to address any issues that become apparent from your budget as you do your budget you will probably struggle at first you will find that you do n't have enough income to cover your expenses fortunately you are now armed with data to be able to tackle this problem there are two causes either your expenses are too high or your income is too low   cut your expenses if necessary before you had a written budget it was hard to know where your money went each month now that you have a budget it might be apparent that you are spending too much on food or that you are spending too much on entertainment or even that a roommate is stealing money do what you need to do to cut back the expenses that need cutting   increase your income if necessary you might find from your budget that your expenses are n't out of line you live in as cheap a place as possible you eat you do n't go out to eat etc in this case the problem is n't your spending it is your income in order to stay out of debt you 'll need to increase your income get a job i know that you said that this will slow your studies but because you are now budgeting you have an advantage you did n't have before you now know how short you are each month you can take a part time job that will earn you just enough income to remain debt free while maximizing your study time   build up a small emergency fund emergencies that you did n't plan for in your budget happen to remain debt free you should have some money set aside to cover something like this so you do n't have to borrow when it comes up the general rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months of expenses but as a college kid with low expenses and no family to take care of you wo n't need a huge fund $ 500 to $ 1000 extra in the bank to cover an unexpected emergency expense could be all it takes to keep you debt free

i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

several things to consider i do n't see why your friend should pay any tax it 's not his income at all and i am not sure where your income should be taxed in this scenario is he declaring it as his income somehow the bank wo n't do it for him the transfer as such should be transparent on the other hand money on his account could in principle look suspicious although € 300 is unlikely to raise alarm what i do know is that if you do pay taxes 20 is not particularly high as such there are four brackets of income tax and tax like contributions to the pension system in the netherlands between and 52 rates for personal taxes in the netherlands are simply way higher than what you might be used to in eastern europe or what has been mentioned in comments   in fact if anything 20 seems too low i am at a loss guessing what it could correspond to you could ask your friend how he came to that number there various tax discounts and deductions that apply to freelance work and some that apply to all incomes € 3000 yearly is quite low and would probably not be taxed at all if you were recently registered as freelance in the netherlands and had no other sources of income but on the other hand if your money is treated as being part of your friend 's income these would n't apply as he is probably already benefiting from them there are special rules for copyright fees not sure this is necessarily 100 kosher but i have met people who got paid that way for articles they wrote in trade publications

unfortunately if your taxes are too complicated for the 1040ez form then your tax situation is effectively unique and you need to try both options and see for yourself which one is better if you do your taxes yourself you may be more likely to do a more thorough job in digging everything up   you might even find that you can deduct some things that you had n't thought of before on the other hand whenever i 've gone to a tax professional it 's always been pretty much an all or nothing proposal   you sit down with them and hand them your records they ask a couple simple questions and they either give you your completed tax return on the spot or they have you come back in a week for a brief review of the final numbers   if they do n't prepare your return on the spot you can usually send additional items later on if you think of something that you forgot the first time around but for the most part it 's still a one time shot that said i 'm beginning to think the difference in monetary cost of completing even a mildly complex tax return is going to be insignificant and the main factors to consider are the value of your own time and how much of the tax code you want to learn because in my experience the software always refers to additional irs forms or codes that are not automated in the software   in theory your tax return should be the same regardless of whether you have a tax professional do your taxes or if you do them yourself which software you use   given the same inputs you should get about the same outputs   even though that theory does n't always hold exactly true all the options should get you in the same ballpark close enough that it does n't make much difference in the grand scheme of things unless your tax return is done incorrectly e.g. you choose the wrong filing status or forget to take a major deduction suppose you 're married and you or your spouse is a partner in an llc   maybe a tax professional wants to charge you $ 500 for your tax return this will vary based on your circumstances   you could alternatively buy the tax software for $ and spend 20 + hours navigating through the interviews and reviewing tax codes for the decisions and worksheets that are not automated in the software   depending on how much time you personally have to spend on the tax return one option might be better than the other   maybe you have to pay your in house accounting person to use the tax software or you have to pay an employee to cover for you while you use the software   keep in mind that the tax professional and the tax software are probably deductible whereas your time may not be   in the end even if you save money up front it might be a wash on the following year 's tax return especially after you consider the time that you could have spent with your family on your business

financial panics tend to last about 7 years   i mean there may be nothing at all unusual about this last one   having a steady hand not panicking may turn out to be the right course   the us is n't japan primarily because our population is still growing and we have a shitload of natural resources   so there is reason to believe we 'll come out of the financial panic in roughly the same timeframe as prior financial panics

yes they 're using it as a currency   what they actually have demand for is houses and and if bitcoin was n't available they 'd be happy to do it in any other currency   when any other currency goes up it 's because there 's overall higher demand than supply for it to buy things you can only buy in a particular currency     a very common example is government bonds of the issuing government for a currency   that 's why when the fed raises the interest rate the us dollar goes up   it is because at a bond auction the government will only take us dollars so anyone that wants to buy some bonds needs to first buy us dollars   if the interest rate goes up all things being equal those bonds are relatively more attractive than other countries bonds and that change in demand increases the demand for the currency which raises it 's price   note the key thing here it needs to be something you can only buy or at least buy for the cheapest price in a particular currency   if it 's something you can buy with any currency than that event generally does n't impact the currency price   although it 's a very important food crop if the price of rice goes up it does n't really impact the usd even though you can buy rice with usd   here 's the tricky part what can you buy with bitcoin that you ca n't buy with any other currency

i do n't think you are reading the stock chart right   has a beta of which means it has more volatility than the market as a whole   see image below for a fairly wild stock chart for a year    i would not truly consider espp participation investing unless you intend to buy and hold the stock   if you intend to sell the stock soon after you are able it is more speculation   espp 's are okay based upon the terms   if the stock was a constant price and you could sell right away then an espp plan would be easy money   often employees are often given a 15 discount to purchase the stock   if you can sell it before any price drop then you are guaranteed to make 15 on the money invested minus any commissions    some employers make espp participants hold the stock for a year   this makes such a plan less of a value   the reasons are the stock can drop in price during that time you could need the money or in the best case your money is tied up longer making the roi less the reasons people invest in stock are varied and is far to much to discuss in a single post   some of your colleagues are using the espp solely to earn the discount in their money

i doubt it if you have a good track record with your car loan that will count for a lot more than the fact that you do n't have it anymore when you look for a house your debt load will be lower without the car loan which may help you get the mortgage you want just keep paying your credit card bills on time and your credit rating will improve month by month

while it 's definitely possible and likely that a diversified portfolio generates higher returns than the s&p 500 that 's not the main reason why you diversify diversification reduces risk   modern portfolio theory suggests that you should maximize return while reducing risk instead of blindly chasing the highest returns think about it this way say the average return is 11 for large cap us stocks the s&p 500 and it 's 10 for a diversified portfolio say 6 8 asset classes the large cap only portfolio has a 10 chance of losing 30 in a given year while the diversified portfolio has a 1 chance of losing 30 in a year for the vast majority of investors it 's worth the 1 annual gap in expected return to greatly reduce their risk exposure of course i just made those numbers up read what finance professors have written for the data and proof but modern portfolio theory is believed by a lot of investors and other finance experts there are a ton of studies and therefore data on mpt including many that contradict it

one possibility that i use i set up an llc and get paid through that entity then i set up a payroll service through bank of america and set up direct deposit so that it is free   i pay myself at 70 of my hourly rate based on the number of hours i work and the payroll service does all the calculations for me and sets up the payments to the irs   typically money is left over in my business account when tax time rolls around i have a w2 from my llc and a 1099 from the company i work for i put the w2 into my personal income and for the business   i enter the revenue on the 1099 and the payroll expenses from paying myself the left over in the business account is taxed as ordinary income maybe it 's overkill but setting up the llc makes it possible to a set up a solo 401(k and put up to $ away tax free and b i can write off business expenses more easily

a savings account is your best bet    you do not have the time frame to mitigate absorb risks   the general guideline for investment is 5 years or more   as you state you are no where near close to that time frame

jesus christ dude talk about being entitled are you seriously that ignorant of the economic climate we live in college tuition is increasing exponentially wages are stagnating and jobs are going away the jobs now require higher degrees and more experience while paying less than they did in the previous generations it is seriously baffling how someone could think the tuition bubble and stagnating job market is completely normal but all the problems are caused by lazy millennial 's

tell us up front what you want to pay for the job and that will really expedite the process   do n't waste good candidates time by them along the interview process if you know and you do know that you 're going to try and low ball them

one thing i would like to clear up here is that black scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math out pops the black scholes formula black scholes gives you the real price under the assumptions of the model your definition of what a real price entails will depend on what assumptions you make with that being said black scholes is popular for pricing european options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method as dumbcoder mentioned should note that for many other types of derivative contracts e.g. american or style exercise the black scholes analytic formula is not appropriate the other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the black scholes model and they most certainly do not to use it if you look at implied for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices you may find that the implied for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the distribution assumption made by black scholes implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness of an option contract with all that being said what i 'm assuming you are interested in is either called a delta gamma approximation or more generally greek based profit and loss attribution in case you wanted to google some more about it here is an example that is relevant to your question let 's say we had the following european call contract popping this in to bs formula gives you a premium of $ delta of and gamma of let 's say you bought it and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes re evaluating with the bs formula gives whereas using a delta gamma approximation gives the actual math does n't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10 move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma

i generally only carry my debit card and a small amount of cash on payday most of my money goes into a bills account so i only have enough in the main account for a few days regular spending this means if i want to buy anything i need to make a transfer from my bills account if i really need to i can transfer the money instantly this over the phone or the web but it cuts down greatly on the impulse purchases as i have to go through a process to get hold of the money   as an aside this approach would probably help if i got mugged or lost the wallet as they would n't get much cash or be able to use my card for very long
