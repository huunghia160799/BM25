there does not appear to be a way to export the customers and invoices nor a way to import them into another data file if you could export them however as said in the comments to your question your question seems predicated upon the notion that it is best practice to create a new data file each year this is not considered necessary it should be noted that gnucash reports should be able to provide    accurate year end data for accounting purposes without    transactions so book closing may not be necessary leaving books    does mean that account balances in the chart of accounts will    not show year to date amounts    closing books gnucash wiki the above linked wiki page has several methods to close the books if that is what you want to do but it is not necessary there is even a description on how to create a new file for the new year which only talks about setting up the new accounts and transactions nothing about customers invoices etc note that you can close the books without creating a new data file in summary you can not do it but you do n't need to create a new file for the new year so you do n't need to do it

you 've got the right idea except that the stated interest rate is normalized for a 1-year investment   hence if you buy a bill you 're getting something closer to of what you 've computed in your question   more precisely the treasury uses a 360 day year for these calculations so you multiply the stated rate by number of days until to get the actual rate of return

yes you can buy to let mortgages are typically lent on a combination of expected rental income plus a part of the applicants other income they also at the moment usually require a fairly hefty deposit   the exact requirements are likely to have changed by the time you apply but in basic yes there is another option you can increase your mortgage on your currently property and buy the btl with cash this gives some more flexibility as you can move faster so is great for an auction purchase it is also often cheaper to mortgage your main property and you will get a lower rate of course to do this you will need sufficient equity in your main property and income to cover the mortgage repayments so the practicality of this depends on your main property value and the amount you need

do n't really know but i can guess firstly everyone thinks the price of gas is too high you drive to work every day and gas is basically the only product who 's price is advertised from the street from that perspective so mentally i argue we an extra 1 percent discount on gas it 's only worth maybe 60 cents a month to me but worth a lot of other fees for the credit card company secondly gas stations are a prime robbery target credit cards mean less cash in the till and less chance for employees to steal from the till and less chance of money finally it 's a competitive market if stations do n't accept a card they 'll lose business to elsewhere there 's a gas station on either side of an intersection and you can always tell which station is a few cents cheaper because it 's the one with customers fueling up while the other one is a ghost town they feel they have to compete on convenience or go under and the credit card companies recruit you into the game with higher cash back rewards

basically the balance you see in your account is the amount of money you currently have a right to based on the fact that you have deposited it with the bank you can of course take this money out pretty well whenever you like or move it however you like however your bank account is not physical money the currency you is and used as the bank sees fit your account is simply a statement keeping track of how much money the bank is holding for you    the banks ability to use deposited funds to make money relies on the fundamental assumption that not everyone is going to withdraw all of there deposited funds at once all banks will have legislated liquidity requirements how much money needs to be kept in cash or near cash securities short term interest bearing paper basically in order to allow for pretty much any reasonable number of people to withdraw any amount of money additionally the bank as you said makes money on its loans securities trading and investment banking activities that money belongs to the bank and gives them even more money to play around with   obviously there have historically been instances in which bank runs occur everyone tries to withdraw all there money at once bank have enough liquid assets to pay or cases in which a bank experiences solvency issues for other reasons having to pay out poorly thought out speculative securities transactions re north american housing crash in 2008 in these cases there are consumer protection agencies that insure financial institutions against insolvency varies by country but under most normal circumstances the bank uses some portion of deposited funds to make money and has systems in place to ensure an individual person can access there deposited funds as needed    tldr account statement just shows how much money you have given the bank and can thus claim back from them in the form of withdraw bank has legally dictated cash reserve percentage to allow for everyone to withdraw money when they need it under most normal circumstances

this is opinion no right or wrong two schools of thought one saying you should aim to be debt free asap the other suggests that when your borrowing expense is so much lower than expected market return just keep investing   with your mortgage a variable i trust the payment is recalculated so if you pay down half the loan it will drop to half when the rate changes and new payment calculated right if not you still have a high payment due until it 's paid in full   me i like the flexibility of going with the full term and saving the money as long as rates are low even moderate inflation will make that payment fell like less over time and there are funds whose dividends are above the mortgage rate if when rates rise you can always pay down aggressively i 'm concerned that you do n't have a good sense of your saving goals you have less than a years income saved for the long term to replace 80 of your income you need about 20 times your current income or $ of course you get to subtract pension income or whatever canada 's social security system is forgive my ignorance on this

let me provide a general answer that might be helpful to others without addressing those specific stocks dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company   a company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by dividend yield traps   if a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay   there are exceptions like what happened with bp but these exceptions are rare   just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future   if the company continues to pay a dividend in the future it may be at a significantly different amount some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends   these companies may have unusually high dividends but this is simply a result of the corporate structure     let me provide a quick example certain etfs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the etf there is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100 certainty   even large companies like general electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis   so to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following update in regards to one the first stock you mentioned this sentence from the companies of yahoo finance explains the unusually dividend the company has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax if it distributes at least 90 of its reit taxable income to its share holders

the big problem with your argument is the 10 per year figure because in the long term especially if adjusted for inflation the prices have not been going up nearly that fast here is a site with some nice graphs for prices over the last 40 years and it 's pretty clear to see that pretty much just what you were talking about happened prices outpaced the ability of people to pay which progressively locked out more and more first time buyers and eventually that breaks the cycle pops the bubble and the prices adjust there is always of course the choice to not buy a house and just rent or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble sell and go back to renting   it 's interesting to note that in general rental rates did not increase at nearly the same pace as the prices in the recent bubble which of course made it harder for anyone who bought investment properties in the recent 8 years or so to cover their payments via rental revenue

if you have a view on housing you can buy a real estate investment trust and use proceeds to pay rent downside is depending on where you live you 'll have to pay tax on dividend income from reits so if you invest the same amount in a reit as in a house you 'll effectively loose some money due to the tax you can also think of it this way you would n't pay tax on the rent that you do n't have to pay as a result of owning a house but you pay tax on rent that other people pay you

you would have to find someone in the other state who wanted to swap   this is conceivable but difficult if you want the houses to be the same value   how do you find the one person who lives in the right place now and wants to move to the right area    the normal way this situation is handled is to simply put your house on the market   at the same time you find a new house in the new location   you arrange for a new mortgage for the new house and make purchase contingent on selling the old house   your buyer pays off your mortgage and gives you a bit left over that you use as a downpayment on the new house    note that you take a loss on closing costs when you do this   this is why if you are in the position where you move frequently you may be better off renting    sometimes an employer will help with this paying for a long term hotel or short term rental   this can give you more room to sell and buy the houses    if you have to move right now immediately not in a few months when your housing situation is fixed consider double renting   you rent out your mortgaged house to someone and pay rent on a new place   you may put some of your stuff in storage until you get into your permanent place    the downside is that it can be harder to sell a house with a tenant until you are close to the end of the lease   and of course you are probably not in the best position to get or pay good rent   your situation restricts your options   you might get stuck in this situation for a year so as to get the time that you need to line up a buyer    of course you may get lucky and find someone who wants your old house as an investment property   such a person wo n't be bothered by a tenant   but they usually want a good price   after all they want to make money off it    there are those operations that advertise that they buy ugly houses   they want a good deal   you 'll probably take a bath   but they can buy quickly so you can move on quickly   no waiting until they find a buyer    and i 'm not saying that you ca n't do a swap like you want   i 'm just saying that you may find it difficult to find a swapping partner   perhaps an investment person would be up for it   they take your house in trade for their house letting you stay in their house until they can fix up your old house and either rent it or sell it   the problem is that it may be hard to find such an investor who can handle a house where you are and has a house where you need to be    i do n't have a good suggestion for finding a swapping partner other than calling a lot of realtors and asking for suggestions   maybe a bit of online checking for properties where the owner 's business is managing the sale

it can be difficult when all your disposable income is spoken for   your options depend on how good your credit is and how flexible your expenses are   i do n't have all the answers without more details possibly not then   however couple of points of advice paying off that credit card debt and not adding any more to it is your 1 priority   you should make minimum payments to every other debt until you have done that because the interest on it will kill you in the mean time   it is always optimal to pay the maximum to your highest interest debt and minimum to all other debts 11 does n't sound very good on your house loan   you may want to consider refinancing   that is if you can get a lower rate   you may also want to get a longer term loan if you have enough discipline to use the extra income to actually pay off your credit card and then the put it toward the house when the cards are paid off look at options to increase your income at least temporarily   second jobs and such   when your finances are more in order you can back off the debt trap is behavioral   we humans tend to increase our spending until we ca n't any more   but the reason we ca n't spend any more is that we have increased our debt until we have no flexible income   then we are stuck for a long time and have few options the only way out long term is to change our habits so that we do n't increase spending each time we pay down a debt or get an increase to our income   financial discipline is the only way to have financial security   almost always the first step is to pay off credit cards and stop maintaining a balance always pay off every card at the end of each month   then start paying off other debts from highest interest rate to lowest this is a hard challenge and one most of us face at some point in our lives   good luck

gt;we also have the highest expenditures as a percent of gdp than any other nation needless to say we spend a lot on health care also   that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3 i m willing to admit my research may be incomplete or inaccurate here as the available are pretty limited in my short time researching    gt;we do have arguably the best health care services in the world that is mostly only true if you are very wealthy   that s a dumb statement leftists make there is no excuse to not put yourself in debt for the best healthcare possible idk about you but i 'd rather be in a lot of debt getting first rate healthcare than get affordable care from a 2nd rate community college doctor did you also know that medical debt does nt effect your credit score so even if you default on medical debts it does nt effect any part of your life so why would nt you go in debt and then slowly pay off that debt with no fear of negative repercussions for not paying   gt;when you break it down on results per dollar spent the us does n't even break the top 20 when you break it down on infant mortality and life expectancy we have been on a backward slide for a while now although those rates improved for the short while that the aca has been in effect as have the net increase in costs at the end of the day the cost of health care has grown 3x faster than inflation and 20x faster than the average income for over 30 years now so no health care in this country is not the best to the average person   i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections you clearly do nt know how the system works especially because you think its my responsibility to provide you with health insurance you keep saying i need to travel and experience the world when all you need to do is go to google and look at what a wonderful job switzerland does with their healthcare the swiss do everything better they have some of the best services in the world and a very affordable healthcare plan with many options that is affordable to the tax payers unlike the aca you have a very clear bias as i m assuming you 're a bernie supporter who loves democratic socialism despite all of its short   gt;and yes space x has been able to estimate a savings of $ 300 m less commercial does a great job of expanding on the research and knowledge that has come from government sponsored r&amp;d. you see that in every modern technological advancement from the internet cellular phones gps medical procedures etc there are so many modern inventions that have sprung from government patents and government research programs   this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time the notion that inventions that were made on the governments dime my dime is somehow the product of the government is asinine at best you re operating under the assumption that these inventions would nt have been made without government funding which is false they all would have been made on a smaller budget granted maybe a little bit further down the road but not by much considering technology has expanded with no help from any government more in the last 20 years than in the prior 200 because that s what technology does it makes life easier for everyone and almost itself take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft can max 10 things government funding invented when i can walk into your house and point out 10000 things the government had no hand in at all

okay savings in a nutshell so take at least year 's worth of rent $ 30k or so maybe more for additional expenses that 's your core emergency fund for when you lose your job or total a few cars or something keep it in a good savings account maybe a cd ladder but the point is it 's liquid and you can get it when you need it in case of emergency replenish it immediately after using it you may lose a little cash to inflation but you need liquidity to protect you from risk it is worth it the rest is long term savings probably for retirement or possibly for a down payment on a home a blended set of stocks and bonds is appropriate with stocks storing most of it if saving for retirement you may want to put the stocks in a tax deferred account if only for the reduced paperwork stocks generate so much having some money especially bonds in something like a roth ira or a non tax advantaged account is also useful as a backup emergency fund because you can withdraw it without penalties take the money out of stocks gradually when you are approaching the time when you use the money if it 's closer than five years do n't use stocks your money should be mostly bonds when you 're about to use it and not 30-year bonds or anything like that either those are sensitive to interest rates in the short term you should have bonds that mature approximately the same time you 're going to use them keep an eye on that if you 're using bond funds which continually roll over that 's basically how any savings goal should work retirement is a little special because it 's sort of like 20 years worth of savings goals so you do n't want all your savings in bonds at the beginning and because you can get fancy tax deferred accounts but otherwise it 's about the same thing college savings likewise there are tools available to help you with this an asset allocation calculator can be found from a variety of sources including most investment firms you can use a target date fund for something this if you 'd like automation there are also a couple things like say vanguard funds from vanguard which target other savings goals you may be able to understand the way these sorts of instruments function more easily than you could other investments you could do a decent job for yourself by just opening up an account at vanguard using their online tool and pouring your money into the stuff they recommend

yes if you gift him with a large amount you may be liable for gift tax i believe the current limit is still $ 17k per person per person per year so between you and your spouse you could give him up to $ per year without triggering gift tax if you want to give a larger sum the standard workaround is an intra family loan for that phrase to learn more about it but basically you loan the money and then gift the payments on the loan this gives him the money up front spreading the gift over subsequent years it requires that you declare the interest that he is supposedly paying you as income there is a lower limit on the interest rate for these loans but it 's a fraction of a percent so this generally is n't a significant cost if you are able to structure the loan as a mortgage he may be able to deduct the interest from his taxes that usually requires a few hundred dollars if paperwork to set up i 've done it it works and one of the advantages is that it puts the exact terms of the on paper where everyone can agree to them which could be useful should there be arguments later on   when doing business with friends and relatives keeping it on a clear business contract basis is the best way to avoid destroying the friendship

it depends on how much money it is going to save you how secure your job is and how much risk is acceptable to you the main problem with taking out a 401k loan for anything is that you have to pay it back within ~60 days of loosing your job which would be precisely when you need your savings the most and then you get the tough choice of using your savings to repay the 401k loan assuming you have an emergency fund or possibly not having enough money to live on until you find another job if you do n't have an emergency fund you are going to get stuck with a substantial tax bill 10 penalty plus taxes at your marginal rate there are definitely advantages to avoiding pmi and you will probably get a pretty decent return on investment mortgage interest rate + cost of pmi but there are risks as well

inflation can be a misleading indicator partly because it is not measured as a function of the change in prices of everything in the economy just the basket of goods deemed essential the other problem is that several things operate on it the supply of money   the total quantity of goods being exchanged and the supply of credit because the supply of goods divides as more stuff is available prices drop it 's not possible to know purely from the price level if prices are rising because there 's an actual shortage say a crop failure or simply monetary expansion at this point it also helps to know that the total money supply of the usa as measured by total quantity of money in bank deposits doubles every 10 years and has done that consistently since the 1970 's   usa total bank deposits so i would say simon moore manages to be right for the wrong reasons despite low inflation cash holdings are being proportionally devalued as the money supply increases most of the increase is going into the stock market however since shares are n't included in the measures of inflation then it does n't influence the inflation rate still if you look at the quantity of shares your money will buy now as opposed to 5 years ago it 's clear that the value of your money has dropped substantially   the in the pack is the influence of the credit supply on the price level

yes when i place an order with my broker they send it out to the exchange for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on     the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers i may be highly doubt it but from my understanding you can not trade directly through an exchange as a retail investor bats allows membership but it is only for   your firm must be a registered broker dealer registered with a self regulatory organization and connected with a clearing firm no apple aapl is listed on the nasdaq so trades go through the nasdaq for aapl caterpillar inc cat is listed on the nyse so trades go through the nyse   the exchange you trade on is dependent on the security if it is listed on the nyse then you trade on the nyse as a regular investor you will be going through a broker when looking to purchase a security it is more important to know about the company and less important to know what exchange it is listed on since there are rules a company must comply with for it to be listed on certain exchanges it does make a difference but that is more the case when speaking about a stock listed over the or nyse it is not important when asking nyse or nasdaq selecting a broker is something that 's dependent on your needs you should ask your self what s important to me do i want iphone android do i need fancy trading tools generally all the brokers you listed will most likely do the trick for you some review sites brokerage review   online broker review 2012 barron 's 2012 online broker review

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

you ca n't calculate how many houses it will take to do so you would have to know how much you can charge in rent compared to how much is costs to run that particular location if the desirability of that location changes so does the ability to rent the place and so does the amount you can charge it is possible to create a business in real estate that would allow you to generate retirement income but you would be focusing all your income in your retirement years on one segment of the entire investment universe the diversification would have to come from spreading the money through different types of real estate condo apartments houses commercial warehouse light industrial you would even have to decide whether you want them all in one micro market or spread throughout a larger market or an even wider area diversification   as your empire grew and you approached retirement age you would have to decide if you wanted to liquidate your investments to minimize risk the long leases that provides stability of income would make it hard to sell quickly if the market in one area started to weaken

i had a 2000 chevy until late 2011 it worked well but was very definitely at the end of its life this was a low end car certainly but i dispute your claim that cars last 20 25 years consumer reports apparently says the average life expectancy of a new vehicle is around 8 years or 150,000 miles when it came time to replace my i was significantly concerned about car safety and about the ability to handle canadian winters temperatures lots of snow i chose a subaru forester as a good match for me i could have bought one second hand but i was n't willing to get one as old as five years car manufacturers constantly improve safety and features over that time period the forester is massively more capable of handling canadian winters than the was if i was buying a forester now i 'd want the driver assist system which subaru added a couple of years after my model year the newer models score slightly higher in crash tests too that would limit me to 2014 or later models and i 'd be concerned someone selling a 2014 or 2015 knew something i did n't knew they had purchased a lemon i did n't need financing for my vehicle on the other hand i could have invested the money i saved so if all i wanted was something to get me from point a to point b my choice does not make much financial sense but canadian winters are brutal and car safety is massively important to me i 'm well aware that i paid considerably for this and i 'm comfortable with my decision

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

it depends on the relative rates and relative risk ignore the deduction you want to compare the rates of the investment and the mortgage either both after tax or both before tax your mortgage costs you 5 a bit less after tax and prepayments effectively yield a guaranteed 5 return if you can earn more than that in your ira with a risk free investment invest if you can earn more than that in your ira while taking on a degree of risk that you are comfortable with invest if not pay down your mortgage see this article mortgage prepayment as investment for example the borrower with a 6 mortgage who has excess cash flow would do well to use it to pay down the mortgage balance if the alternative is investment in assets that yield 2 but if two years down the road the same assets yield 7 the borrower can stop allocating excess cash flow to the mortgage and start accumulating financial assets note that he 's not comparing the relative risk of the investments paying down your mortgage has a guaranteed return you 're talking about cds which are low risk so your comparison is simple if your alternative investment is stocks then there 's an element of risk that it wo n't earn enough to outpace the mortgage cost update hopefully this example makes it clearer for example lets compare investing $ 100,000 in repayment of a 6 mortgage with investing it in a fund that pays 5 before tax and taxes are deferred for 10 years for the mortgage we enter 10 years for the period 3.6 if that is the applicable rate for the after tax return $ 100,000 as the present value and we obtain a future value of $ for the alternative investment we do the same except we enter 5 as the return and we get a future value of $ however taxes are now due on the $ of interest which reduces the future value to $ the mortgage repayment does a little better so if your marginal tax rate is 30 you have $ 10k extra cash to do something with right now mortgage rate is 5 ira cd apy is 1 and assuming retirement in 30 years if you want to plug it into a spreadsheet the formula to use is substitute your own values note the minus sign before the cash amount make sure you use after tax rates for both so that you 're comparing apples to apples then multiply your ira amount by to get the value after you pay future taxes on ira withdrawals

there is a substantial likelihood over the next several years that the us dollar will experience inflation you may have heard terms like quantitative easing with inflation the value of each dollar you have will go down this also means that the value of each dollar you owe will go down as well   so taking out a loan issuing a bond at a very good rate converting it into an asset that 's a better way to store value possibly including stock in a big stable company like msft and then watching inflation reduce the real value of the loan faster than the interest piles up that 's like getting free money combine that with the tax shelter games alluded to by everyone else and it starts to look like a very profitable endeavour

compounding is just the notion that the current period 's growth or loss becomes the next period 's principal so applied to stocks your beginning value plus growth or loss in value plus any dividends becomes the beginning value for the next period your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them   compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed either by you or to you you have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance the new balance is used to calculate the next period 's interest which again adds to the balance etc obviously it 's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end interest bearing investments like bonds pay simple interest like stock dividends you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect when using a basic calculator tool for stocks you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your interest rate for bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the interest rate factoring in risk you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time believe it or not this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off

you need to pay off the entire balance of as soon as possible this should be your primary financial goal at this point above anything else a basic structure that you can follow is this is the £ 1500 balance with the interest rate the obvious starting point here yes that is fine but all the cards and overdraft debts need to be treated with the same urgency what are the prospects for improving my credit score in say the next 6 12 months enough to get a 0 balance transfer or loan for consolidation this should not be a primary concern of yours if you want to move on with your financial life debt consolidation will not help you achieve the goals you have described home ownership financial stability if you follow the advice here by the time you get to the point of being eligible you may not see enough savings in interest to make it worth the hassle focus on the hard stuff and pay off the balances is that realistic or am i looking at a longer term struggle you are looking at a significant struggle if it was easy you would not be asking this question the length of time will be determined by your choices how aggressively you will cut your lifestyle take on extra jobs and place additional payments on your debt   by being that extreme you will actually start to see progress which will be encouraging if you go in half committed your progress will show as much and it will be much of your success will hinge on your mental and emotional toughness to push through the hard work of delaying pleasure and paying off these balances that is just my personal experience so you can take it or leave it the credit score will take care of itself if you follow this method so do n't worry about it good luck

short selling can be a good strategy to hedge but you have almost unlimited downside   if a stock price skyrockets you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital a smarter strategy to hedge that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down   your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more another way to hedge is to sell calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to   you might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you did n't want to sell your shares right now   that way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option you 'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that

it would be difficult but it 's a statistical task and you 'd need to refer to a competent statistician to really get a sense of what sort of certainty could be derived from the available data   i believe that you 'd start by looking over your state by state data on a granular level to try to find if there was any persistent correlation between amazon 's market penetration in a particular area and employment data from the retail industry   with regards to ma amp pa 's complaint you 're sort of wrong and sort of right   obviously they have no direct knowledge that online retail was responsible for the decline in sales that they saw   in terms of sustainability and mismanagement however they can show you their books   if the business had been established from some time it would be easy to see whether it had indeed been a sustainable business model in prior years   sustainability and mismanagement however are when it comes to reasoning about causes   in measuring the effect of amazon 's entry into the market on local businesses we can just as easily use a model that assumes a perfect market that inefficiencies on the part of amp would lead them to be displaced by amp and that on average amp manage their business sufficiently well to extract an optimal return on effort     if circumstances are such that the role of vendor is not fungible and the supply of mas and pas does not respond to the demand for family stores then i do n't actually know how to do the math but on the other hand i do recognize a smoking gun

the usual pattern is that shareholders do n't run companies in a practical sense so if someone was just simply rich to buy > 50 but does not know how to handle the company does n't change anything in large companies the involvement of shareholders is limited to a few votes on key issues such as allocating profit how much to keep in company vs pay in dividends and choosing board members and board members also do n't run the company they oversee how the company is being run and choose executives who will actually run the company if a rich person simply buys 50 and does n't desire to get personally involved then they just vote for whatever board members seem and forget about it

the company 's value which should be reflected in the share price is not how much money it has in the bank but something along the lines of how much money will it make between now and the end of times adjusted for time value of money and risk so when you purchase a share of a company that has say little money in the bank but expects to make profit this year for the following 3 years and say nothing after you are going to pay your fraction of minus some discount because of the risk involved if now they announce that their profits were only then people may think that the are more likely to be so the company 's value would go to ~ and with that the market may perceive the company as more risky because its profits from what was expected which in turn may reduce the company 's value even further

there is little difference between buying shares in your broker 's index fund and shares of their corresponding etf   in many cases the money invested in an etf gets essentially stuffed right into the index fund i believe vanguard does this for example   in either case you will be paying a little bit of tax   in the etf case it will be on the dividends that are paid out   in the index fund case it will additionally be on the capital gains that have been realized within the fund which are very few for an index fund   not a ton in either case   the more important tax consideration is between purchase and sale which is the same in either case i 'd say stick it wherever the lowest fees are

nobody can predict the affects of brexit but it is wise to consider them we saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic if that happens it is likely to increase inflation uk inflation has gone from under 1 around the time of the referendum to 3 today and it could well go higher if inflation continues to increase the bank of england is likely to put up interest rates as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation   we have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the boe has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates   the rates can not continue at this level if inflation starts to rise that in turn will put up mortgage rates   so for example if you have a £ 100k mortgage at currently this is a reasonable rate to have your repayments will be £ 523 a month   if your mortgage rate goes up to say 7 then your repayments are £ a month if it goes up to 10 then it 's £ a month and so on there is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here my advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra there are other risks from brexit as well house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates overall nobody knows what will happen but it is good to be planning ahead for all i am not a financial advisor this advice is given in good faith but with no financial qualification

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

there is the price they want and the price you pay everything is negotiable when its a service always possible but usually harder with actual goods you should always haggle and price match your vendors you can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference for example call up a florist and say you need x y and z for a corporate or for a special event for which you can not give the details if you then tell them its actually a wedding and they blindly raise it without a good justification move on that said they jack up the price because they know most people will says it 's my wedding it 's once in a lifetime it 's my special day etc the same is true about diamonds their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio just the perception that has been created however as mentioned in some of the comments above the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner the more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees no hidden fees and you have well written well reviewed contracts for example we know a couple whose added a mandatory 20 gratuity regardless of the service which was provided most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a lose leader but they will charge for other things   you can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product i think a good analogy to this is the recent time magazine article on the price of healthcare it costs a lot because its a small market and its harder to navigate and most are not experienced shoppers in the area or do n't have control over the individual item costs

in principle when you are the sole owner of a limited company and also the sole employee then it is much easier to assume that someone else is the employee let 's say your twin brother john   john receives a salary from david 's company of course john has to pay income tax on his salary absolutely in the uk and in estonia as well if they have any sensible tax laws at all which i assume but do n't know for sure   then there is the company it 's profit equals revenue minus cost you said £ 4000 revenue and john 's salary plus anything the company has to pay on top of the salary is cost which is subtracted from the revenue to calculate profit in the uk the company pays 20 corporation tax on those profits and the rest stays in its bank account or may be in goods that the company purchased   where does david come in he owns the company but does n't work for it and gets no salary he owns the company but he does not own the company 's money he ca n't just help himself to the money he can get a loan from the company and is personally responsible for repaying that loan if it 's not repaid hmrc will be very angry which will hurt or he can pay himself a dividend and pays dividend tax on it or of course he can leave the money in the company   that 's exactly how it works in the uk and i would assume estonia to be similar and of course if it 's not the twin brother who is the employee but the op himself then the situation is exactly the same

risk is the problem as others have pointed out your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only let 's say your 3 might be good for five years because that 's typical of fixed rate in canada so what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8 your investment would be underwater and you would n't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy rather you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any leverage or borrowing to invest amplifies your risk considerably if you invest your own money in the market you might lose what you started with but if you borrow to invest you might lose much more than you started with there 's also one very specific issue with the example investment you 've proposed you would be borrowing canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of u.s based companies that trade in u.s. dollars even if the index has positive returns in u.s. dollar terms you might end up losing money if the canadian dollar strengthens vs. the u.s. dollar it has happened before multiple times so while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past it has also failed in the past unless you have a crystal ball you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards there is no free lunch

you would need to check the original mortgage papers you signed with the originators   chances are you agreed to allow the mortgage to be sold and serviced by other parties refinancing would also put you in the same boat unless you got them to take that clause out of the mortgage refinance papers also chances are most small banks and originators simply can not keep mortgages on their books there are also third parties that service loans too that do not actually own the mortgages as well this is another party that could be involved out of many in your mortgage   i would also not worry about complaints out of loans most probably were underwater on their mortgage but i am sure a few are legitimate complaints   banks make mistakes i know right   anyway good luck and let me know if you find out anything different

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

i do n't think this should be very surprising if you make more than someone over a long period of time the gap between your total income or wealth is going to increase say a person makes $ while another makes $ day 1 $ 100 v $ 50 day 2 $ 200 v. $ 100 day 3 $ 300 v. $ 50 and so on and so forth now make those numbers $ 1500 v. $ 100 and you can see why the wealth difference is so wide they may have to choose between lowering the person making more or increase the pay of the person making less

gt though i 'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome i think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :p       i will say that to your point i have come to believe that there are two forces at odds that are required for a robust and long lived prosperous society   1   a capitalist system that encourages innovation through competition and   2   a government to check the inevitable concentration of wealth that capitalism naturally trends toward   they most effective ways for a government to check that concentration is through a progressive tax system and a check on the power that the concentration of wealth creates eg forcing employers to pay a living wage instead of using a bully to extract the maximum effort for the lowest possible cost as shown by the robber barons etc of the 1900s   either way i 'll admit that i am not talking about pure capitalism   however like the philosopher all ideas go through a process of thesis the first idea aka capitalism the idea in this case socialism and then synthesis the resulting compromise   the synthesis then becomes the new thesis for the system to further evolve upon   it 's time for american capitalism to evolve

insurance companies on average make money by selling insurance which    means you lose money on average by dealing with them the insurance is not gambling where the house always wins this expression is literal in gambling because that 's how they set the odds insurance is n't necessarily similar example suppose there 's 10 chance that $ 10,000 the boat sinks due to a defect so on average your loss is going to be $ 1,000 the variability of your loss measured as its standard deviation is $ the variability of loss is a measure of risk now let 's look at two $ 10,000 boats there 's 1 chance that they both sink and 18 chance that only one of them sinks so the expected loss is unsurprisingly $ 2,000 however the variability of expected loss is $ not quite twice the risk variability of a single boat accident if you imagine that instead of a couple of boats the insurance has 100 boats the variability of their loss hence their risk will increase only by a factor of 10 not 100 compared to a single boat this means that their risk in relative terms is smaller than yours the individual insurer 's   what i tried to show was that it is possible to both of you and the insurer to benefit from the arrangement it does n't mean that it happens in every case but generally it does that 's why in actuarial science there 's a term fair price update i was trying to avoid talking about utility here because it 's an involved subject but you 're dragging the discussion in this direction you 're right that expected value can not explain the insurance the reason is that there 's another concept that 's necessary in addition to the objective measures such as expected value and risk i mean the utility function or risk aversion so in short you need to maximize expected utility not the expected payout here 's a toy example with the same boat assume that insurance is $ 150 and they pay the entire boat 's value in case of accident i.e. $ 10,000 you 're given two choices effectively at the end of the year you have either of the following you 're right that the expected value in the second option can be higher in the second option let 's say the probability of the loss is 10 in this case the expected value would $ 9,900 which is higher than certain value of option 1 why then some people choose option 2 the reason is that we do n't maximize the expected payout but we maximize the utility according to modern microeconomics and game theory   utility is some kind of an function that reflects your preference given the uncertain choices every person has their own preferences and utility function   let 's say that yours is exponential with in this case we can calculate the expected utility as follows the math works out in such a way that it accounts for your risk tolerance depending on how much you love or hate risk your expected utilities for these option will come out differently for this given toy example it turned out that the expected utility is higher with insurance so this person should get it however for different values of a parameter a in the function it may not make a sense to insure some people are risk averse some are risk lovers in certain situations that 's the reason why given the same options we make different choices you may say that you do n't value certainty enough to buy this insurance the bottom line is that nobody can tell you that you 're wrong to not buy an insurance if your risk tolerance is high it may not make a sense for you having said this all i must note that sometimes the society does n't accept your preferences and utility function yes you tell me today that you accept the risk but tomorrow when the boat sinks you may come to me and say that you ca n't pay the student loan because of the hardship that 's the reason why it 's mandatory to get liability insurance on cars for instance

i 'm not sure i understand your question but i 'll try to answer what i think you 're asking i think you 're asking this a us bank receives a wire transfer from a chinese bank how does the    us bank ensure there 's any money in fact arriving before crediting the    destination account well the way wire transfers work is that the us bank would debit the account with that us bank so the us bank in fact transfers the money between two internal accounts debit to the chinese bank 's account with that us bank and credit the destination customer account if the chinese bank does n't have an account with the destination us bank a third party intermediary is used that both banks have accounts with such third party will charge an additional fee hence sometimes the wire transfer fees are slightly higher than you initially know when sending the money the third party would debit from the transfer amount regular iban ach transfers work through regulatory channels that ensure integrity and essentially use a regulatory bank as that third party but because they 're done in batches and not on line they 're much cheaper and the accounting is for the whole batch and not each transfer separately but batch processing means it will take a day or two of processing while wire transfer takes hours at most

as i see it the two main considerations are   total amount of money received for which the key variable is life expectancy 0.8 = so at £ 86 week she would only be better off with the lump sum if she expected to live for less than years obviously none of us have a crystal ball but you could make some assessment based on her current health risk factors etc to see whether that seemed feasible also you do have to bear in mind that the value of £ 86 in 7 years time will be less than it is now but i guess the £ 86 would be inflation adjusted her need for income versus capital if she takes a lump sum and invests it in a house that is great but does n't provide any income at all if she has sufficient income from other sources and forecasts this other income to continue until her death then the lump sum might be more attractive but if not then she would need to be sure that she was n't tying up the money unnecessarily another option here would be using the lump sum to buy an annuity and it might be exploring this but i doubt whether the rates would be good enough to beat the £ 86 week she is being offered as an alternative another lesser consideration is her future entitlement to state funded care if needed in her later years if you have assets above a certain amount you are expected to fund your own care in which case having an expensive house might actually be more of a liability than a help

my google home does a good job of recognizing my voice and using guest mode for other people using it but you made a fair point about controlling connected home devices i would n't use a voice authenticated door lock   but i do n't see any evidence that my data over at google or amazon is vulnerable sure there 's some exposure and risk i have to accept but to argue that it 's unsecured and that someone could get unauthorized access to it is extremely presumptuous

lets make some assumptions you are not close to retirement   you have no other debts   you have a job   you have no big need for the money    you should invest that   do not invest with a bank they are not as competitive on fees as a brokerage account you can get specific answers that are different from every person so you should dig in and research a lot more if you care and you should   personally i would suggest you open an account with one of the low cost providers then with that new investment account put your money into a target retirement account   file your statements away and tend to it once a year   make sure it is there that you can access it that nothing alarming is going on   you certainly have enough to start an investment account   if you want to get more into it ask a phone adviser what you should open finally before you start investing make sure you follow the advice of and have no debt saving the most you can for retirement a rule of thumb is your money will double every 72 months congratulations you are a saver   investing is n't for you as the risk of investing is in conflict with your desire to you money open a savings account or high interest checking account with a credit union online only or local community bank   shop around no the web for the highest interest   do n't get your hopes up though the highest rate you see that does n't have strings attached wo n't be much here late summer of 2012

depending on where you live in the uk buying a house sooner might be a better option i would echo the advice about putting some money away into a rainy day fund etc above but i know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7 per year i bought a house two years ago and i 'm paying 4 interest on my mortgage so i 'm effectively making money by owning my house   given that you want to buy a house if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest you 're effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices meaning you 'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £ 4k in lawyers fees surveys mortgage setup fees etc and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a of the sale cost if you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. london where house prices are currently skyrocketing if you do n't want to live in the house you may be able to do a buy to let as an investment generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent property management company 's fees so while you wo n't see any actual net income the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you 'll be building equity on the home it 's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc

we do n't have all the details but individuals and corporations can either deduct or elect to get a credit for foreign taxes paid what if this stays and the state local deduction is eliminated the irs directly states the intent is to avoid double taxation     and ya the system you make reference to was tried in the articles of and proved    the initial point is that it makes no sense to eliminate the state and local tax deduction unless the intent is to punish blue states and in order to offset a reduction in taxes for the wealthy

do you have other income that you are not considering   interest and dividends would be an example but there are all sorts of options    also with your witholding is it set up such that your employers have any idea of your tax bracket ultimately based on your combined incomes   usually what they do is take out money assuming you will be in the tax bracket of any given paycheck spread out over the course of a year   for example for federal i had an option to select in an online form that fills out my w4 for me married at higher single rate and did to try and cover this fact   eventually i may end up having to calculate my own witholding to fix a too low problem like yours

how realistic is it that i will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so   very unlikely in the next year   the debt income ratio is n't good enough and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range you do n't mention how long you 've been employed at these incomes this can also count against you if you have n't both been employed for a full year at these incomes they will look even more on the employment situation if they are n't both full time jobs although if you have a full year 's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time part time issue next year or so if you pay down your high interest debt car credit cards and maintain employment keep your check stubs and tax returns the loan officer will want copies then there 's a slight chance and from this quick snap shot of our finances does it look like we would be able to qualify for a usda loan probably not   mostly for the same reasons the only time a usda loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment even with an available down payment of 50k you would n't be able to get a regular loan therefore it 's unlikely that you 'd qualify for a usda loan if you are anxious to get into a house choose something much smaller in the range it would improve your debt loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a usda loan   however i think you 'd still have issues if you have n't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year i 'll echo what others have suggested though strengthen your credit eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can car credit cards and keep your jobs for a year or two   start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment at least 3 5 of the desired home price when you are in a better position to buy during this time keep track of your paycheck stubs you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request note that even with a usda loan you still have to pay closing costs and those can run several thousand dollars so do n't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash lastly there 's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size   if you can consider buying the house as if you only had the per year   move the debt to the person making the lower income and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making per year then the debt loan ratio looks very positive   further it may be that the credit history of that person is better and the employment history is better   if one of you has better history in these ways then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house   banks ca n't tell you about this but it does work   keep in mind though that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other 's name   not a great situation to be in so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made

the biggest value driver we identified were staff costs if amazon implements their amazon go technology in whole foods i assume is their current plan they would be able to cut a large chunk of staff costs reducing cogs significantly with partners buying up shares and an already large institutional share of ownership we saw the likelyhood of success of a deal to be quite high    the new technology is exciting and we believe interest for shopping at amazon will be high the first years which brings revenue synergies to the table    i 'm on mobile right work so maybe i can give a more detailed answer later

actually it 's much cheaper to just keep employees in the dark so they do n't see the the more expensive option in the short term is to do what this article suggests so the company can keep employees happy which makes us more productive and reduces the costs of constantly hiring new people unfortunately i think most employers would rather gamble that their employees will never find out because it 's taboo to ask how much your co workers make or are too scared to look for new jobs anyway

the best strategy skip the loan find a way to invest for a low starting amount via a retirement account such as a 401 k or ira in the united states or non retirement account use this money to buy individual stocks or funds every month put money from your regular income into this investment account then buy more stocks or sell if the conditions change based on what the market is doing not to meet a loan payment this helps you because if the price fluctuates you will buy more shares if the price is down and you will buy fewer shares when the price is up it also allows you to skip worrying about how to repay the loan it also means that you not have to pull more money out of savings to make the final loan payments if it does n't make as much money as you plan regarding your math this is a better understanding of the money flow than the earlier question

a junk bond is broadly a bond with a non negligible risk of default   bond ought to be defined elsewhere but broadly it 's a financial instrument you buy from a company or government where they promise to pay you back the principal and some interest over time on a particular schedule the name junk is a bit exaggerated many of them are issued by respectable and reasonably stable businesses junk bonds were required to do large leveraged buyouts   this means the company issued fairly risky fairly high yield debt to buy out equity holders   they have to pay a high rate on the debt because the company 's now fairly highly geared ie has a lot of debt relative to its value and it may have to pay out a large fraction of its earnings as interest what is a junk bond and how does it differ from a regular bond   it 's only a matter of degree and nomenclature   a bond that has a credit rating below a particular level eg s&p is called junk or more politely non investment grade or speculative   it 's possible for an existing bond to be reclassified from one side to another or for a single issuer to have different series some of which are more risky than others   the higher the perceived risk the more interest the bond must pay offer in order to attract lenders why is there higher risk chance of default well why would a company be considered at higher risk of failing to repay its debt   basically it comes down to doubt about the company 's future earnings being sufficient to repay its debt which could be for example

i would recommend that you establish a landlord tenant relationship instead of joint ownership ie 100 ownership stake for one of you vs 0 for the other it is much cleaner and simpler   basically one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord alternatively you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price   if neither of you can afford the down payment then you can consider the renter 's contribution an unsecured loan at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule if you must have both names on the financing then i would recommend you sell the property or refinance under a single name as quickly as possible when the relationship ends if not before pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity or debt   in any case if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship then you are either buying a house you ca n't afford or partnering on it with someone you should n't

this is a reasonable requirement which many banks probably have the reason is that after you deposit a check ach or direct deposit they may be reversed after a couple of days check bounced payment canceled etc if you wire the money out and then the check by which you got the money gets bounced the bank is left hanging because money wired out is very hard to return wire transfers are generally irreversible unless its a mistake in the wire   after 10 days these transactions can not be reversed and the money is bound to remain on the account so you can wire it out by the way it also goes for cashier 's checks as well i had a similar discussion with my banker do n't remember if it was wf or chase when i needed one based on a ach transfer from my savings account elsewhere they gave me the check but said that its because i proved that the transfer was from my own account

it 's very hard to measure the worth of an abstract concept like money particularly over long periods of time in the modern era we have things like the consumer price index cpi in the united states where the bureau of labor statistics literally sends shoppers out to find prices of things and surveys people to find out what they buy this results in a variety of indexes which get reported by media outlets as inflation or deflation if the change in value goes the other way there are also other measurements available like the mit billion prices project which attempt to make their own reading of the worth of currencies those kinds of things are about the only ways to measure a currency 's change in value to itself because a currency is basically only worth what one can buy with it while it is n't all the world 's currencies combined there is a concept of the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights which is a basket of five currencies used by world central banks to help back each other 's currencies and is very occasionally used as a unit of currency for international contracts one might be able to compare the price of one currency to that of the or even to any other weighted average of world currencies that one wanted but i do n't think it 's done nearly as often as comparing currencies to the basket of goods one can buy to find inflation even though one might think what would be important to measure would be overall money supply inflation much more often people care more about measuring price inflation occasionally people worry about wage inflation but generally that 's considered a result of high price inflation in order to try to keep this on topic as a personal finance thing rather than an economics thing i guess the question is why do you want to know if you have some assets in a particular currency you probably care most about what you 'll be able to buy with them in the future when you want or need to spend them in that sense it 's inflation that you 're likely caring about the most if you 're trying to figure out which currency to keep your assets in it largely depends on what currency your future expenses are likely to be in though i can imagine that one might want to move out of a particular currency if there 's a lot of political instability that you 're expecting to lead to high inflation in a currency for a time

according to this q&a by a houston law professor the law however is not designed to interfere with an individual 's right to stop payment on a valid check because of a dispute with someone if he did n't deliver as promised you do not owe the money and have the right to stop payment assuming that you had enough money in the bank to cover the check stopping payment is not a crime i found several other pages essentially saying the same thing   all the usual disclaimers apply i am not a lawyer this is not legal advice etc   in particular laws might vary by state basically though it does n't seem there 's any reason why you ca n't stop payment on the check just because you feel like it   if you then provide a cashier 's check for the payment your ex partner will not really have anything to complain about   if you 're worried about annoying him by doing this that 's a separate issue but given the situation you describe i do n't see why you should be   if you feel he is being a pain in the neck feel free to be a pain in the neck right back and force him to accept the payment in the manner you decide instead of allowing him to string you along note two things obviously if you have reason to believe the guy will sue you you should act with caution   also i 'm not suggesting withdrawing payment completely only stopping the check and issuing a new payment that you do n't have to wait on e.g. cashier 's check

there are a lot of false claims around the internet about this concept the fact of the matter is you are giving yourself the ability to have money in a tax favored environment with consistent steady growth as well as the ability to access it whenever you want   compare this to a 401k plan for example money is completely at risk you ca n't touch it and you 're penalized if you do n't follow the government 's rules as far as commissions to the agent an agent will cut his commission in half by selling you an infinite banking style policy as opposed to a traditional whole life policy @duffbeer703 clearly does n't understand life insurance in the slightest when he says that the first three years of your premium will go to the agents pocket   and as usual offers no alternative except pick some high yielding stocks and mlps someone needs to wake up from the dave ramsey and realize that there is no such thing as a 12 mutual fund do your research on the stock market research   do n't just listen to dave who still thinking getting 12 15 year in and year out is possible it 's frustrating to listen to people who are so uneducated on the subject remember the internet has turned everyone into experts if you want real advice talk to a legitimate expert that understands life insurance and how it actually works

realize that not everyone has the ability to save like that   if someone can save money that means they are being paid slightly more than they need to survive   many employers too many take that as a sign that they are over paying their workforce and can easily replace them with people who get paid less since they can also make it work by not setting anything significant aside   a lot of these people are only making it work by relying on credit too   it 's easier than you might think to get trapped in a debt spiral and a lot harder to get out when you ca nt take classes or even re education courses to help you move up

first are you sure that no interest accrues on the student loans until six months after you finish your studies my understanding is that you have to start paying back the student loans six months after leaving the university but that does n't mean no interest accrues in the meantime my concern about student loans is that life happens and when it happens in an unexpected way the powers of the student loan companies exceed pretty much everybody else 's with the possible exception of the irs if you are in a position to be able to pay cash for the tuition then i would cut back the lifestyle scrimp as much as i can and pay cash you 'll be in a much better position afterwards for starters you wo n't have a student loan payment which means you 're in a much better position financially than most of your peers and have a lot more options open plus you 're not carrying around a mortgage before you even bought a house

i agree with the previous comments one thing that got brought up a while back when i was looking into purchasing a prius was the battery replacement someone once told me it was very expensive in the event it failed and needed to be changed i 'm not talking about the 12 volt but the big nickel metal one another thing to factor is the gas that you will save normally the prius get double the gas milage of that of civic or a corolla but unless you drive a bunch of miles per day you really do n't see the pay off   also if you can pull a on the car the 20 dollar investment is worth it because you can find out if it was in an accident or if it 's a lemon i once bought a bmw and did n't do a and later ended up finding out that the car had more owners than a taxi had customers   also just like said above 200k car vs 100k always mean the 100k is better off especially if the previous owner never services it well get the car checkout before you make the deal to buy

if you know that your tax situation is not easily handled by the standard withholding table then you can use that line to ask for additional funds be withheld you could also ask for less money to be withheld    why would somebody do this they had a small side business that made them extra income and wanted to withhold extra money from their full time job to cover the extra income they might have been awarded a big bonus and it caused too much in taxes to be withheld so they wanted to not have as much taxes from their regular pay check given the fact that you are young in your first real job and almost the entire tax year ahead of you it is likely that the standard tax tables will be close enough so leave the line blank or put zero

this is actually quite a complicated issue i suggest you talk to a properly licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state legal advice from an attorney licensed in your state is also highly recommended there are many issues at hand here income both types of entities are pass through so earnings are taxed the same however for s corp there 's a reasonable compensation requirement so while b and c do n't do any work they may be required to draw salary as executives directors if they act as such equity for s corp you can not have different classes of shares all are the same so you can not have 2 partners contribute money and third to contribute nothing work is compensated you 'll be getting salary and all three have the same stake in the company you can have that with an llc expansion s corp is limited to x shareholders all of which have to be americans once you get a foreign partner or more than 100 partners you automatically become c corp whether you want it or not investors it would be very hard for you to find external investors if you 're a llc there are many more things to consider do not make this decision lightly fixing things is usually much more expensive than doing them right at the first place

it depends on what stocks you invest in or whether you invest in an index as all stocks are not created equally if you prefer to invest directly into individual stocks and you choose ones that are financially health and trending upwards you should be able to easily outperform any indexes and get your 30 return much quicker but you always need to make sure that you have a stop loss placed on all of your stocks because even the best performing companies can go through bad patches the stop loss prevents you from losing all your capital if the share price suddenly starts going south and turns into a downtrend

former software developer at an insurance company here not state farm though all of the above answers are accurate and address how the business analysts come up with factors on which to rate your quote i wanted to chime in on the software side here specifically what goes into actually crunching those numbers to produce an end result in my experience business analysts provide the site developers with a spreadsheet of base rates and factors which get imported into a database when you calculate a quote the site starts by taking your data and finding the appropriate base rate to start with usually based on vehicle type quote type personal commercial etc and zip code for the us the appropriate factors are then also pulled and are typically either or additive relative to the base rate the most creative operation i 've seen other than add multiply was a linear to get some kind of gradient value usually based on the amount of coverage you selected at this point you could have upwards of twenty rating factors affecting your base rate marriage status reports basically anything you might 've filled into your application in the case of reports specifically we 'd usually verify your input against an providing service to check that you did n't omit any violations but we would n't penalize for lying about it we did n't get that creative then we 'd apply any fees and discounts before out the final number with all that said these algorithms that companies apply to calculate quotes are confidential as far as i 'm aware insofar as they do n't publish those steps anywhere for the public to access the type of algorithm used could even vary based on the state you live in or really just when the site code is arbitrarily updated to use a new rating system underwriters and agents might have access to company specific rating tables so they might have more insight at the company level   in short if there 's an equation out there being used to calculate your rate it 's probably a huge string of with some base rate additions and linear in based on factors and base rates that are n't readily publicized your best bet is to not go through the site at all and talk to a state farm agent about agency specific practices if you 're really curious about the numbers

us corporations are allowed to automatically enter employees into a 401 k plan   a basic automatic enrollment 401(k plan must state that employees    will be automatically enrolled in the plan unless they elect otherwise    and must specify the percentage of an employee 's wages that will be    automatically deducted from each paycheck for contribution to the    plan the document must also explain that employees have the right to    elect not to have salary deferrals withheld or to elect a different    percentage to be withheld an eligible automatic contribution arrangement is similar to    the basic automatic enrollment plan but has specific notice    requirements an can allow automatically enrolled participants to    withdraw their contributions within 30 to 90 days of the first    contribution a qualified automatic contribution arrangement is a type of    automatic enrollment 401(k plan that automatically passes certain    kinds of annual required testing the plan must include certain    features such as a fixed schedule of automatic employee    contributions employer contributions a special vesting schedule and    specific notice requirements you generally have a period of time to stop the first deposit one i saw recently gave new employees to the first paycheck after the 60 day mark to refuse to join you also may be able to get back the first deposit if you really do n't want to join if you do n't want to participate look on the corporate website or the fidelity website to set your future contributions to 0 of your paycheck keep in mind several things personally i 'm against any type of government sponsored investments or    savings i can save money on my own and i do n't care about their    benefits some companies provide an annual   contribution to all employees regardless of participation in the 401k. they do need to establish an account to do that again that is free money does it mean if i never contribute any money so i will have 0 i might    go below 0 and owe them money in case they bankrupt or do bad    investments even in total market collapse the value of the 401 k could never go below zero unless the 401 k was setup to allow very exotic investments

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable
# 410564
like pointed out fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the interest you are paying on the loan in india the safe returns from fixed deposits is around 8 9 currently factoring taxes the real rate of return would be around 6 7 this is less than what you are paying towards interest the ppf gives around 9 with tax break if there are no other options and tax free interest the real return can be as high as 12 14 there is a limit on how much you can invest in ppf however this looks higher than your average interest the stock markets in long term 7 years averages give you around 15 returns but are not predictable year to year so the suggest from is valid you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment you should complete it asap if there are loans that are less than average say in the range of 7 8 you can keep it and pay as per schedule

no that return on equity number is a target that the regulators consider when approving price hikes if pg&e tried to get a 20 roe the regulator would deny the request utilities are basically compelled to accept price regulation in return for a   monopoly on utility business in a geographic area there are obviously no guarantees that a utility will make money but these good utilities are good stable investments that generally speaking will not make you rich but appreciate nicely over time due to deregulation however they are a more complex investment than they once were basically the utility builds and maintains a bunch of physical infrastructure buys fuel and turns it into electricity so they have fixed costs regulated pricing market driven costs for fuel and market driven demand for electricity   also consider that the marginal cost of adding capacity to the electric grid is incredibly high so uneven demand growth or economic disruption in the utility service area can hurt the firms return on equity and thus the stock price compare the stock performance of he the hawaiian electric to ed consolidated edison the nyc utility to so southern companies the utility for much of the south you can see that the severe impact of the recession on he really damaged the stock location matters buying strategy is key as well during bad market conditions money flows into these stocks which are considered to be low risk defensive investments and inflates the price you do n't want to buy utilities at a peak you need to dollar cost average a position over a period of years and hold it focus on the high quality utilities or quality local utilities if you understand your local market look at southern co progress energy duke energy or american electric power as high quality benchmarks to compare with other utilities

if the equity market in the usa crashed its very likely equity markets everywhere else would crash the usa has a high number of the world 's largest businesses and there are correlations between equity markets so you need to think of equities as a global asset class not regional your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets   here 's a guess if equity markets crashed you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies but probably the most in usd due to the large number of the world 's largest businesses trading on us stock exchanges therefore when the rest of the world sells us equities they receive cash usd which they might sell for their local currency that selling pressure would cause usd to fall but when equity markets crash there 's a move to safety of the bond markets the world 's largest bond markets are denominated in which currency probably usd so those who receive usd for their equities are going to spend that usd on bonds in which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all a quick google search shows this kind of thing

startup costs are amazingly high   running fiber to individual houses takes a lot of labor   another problem you do n't hear too much about is the legal side   i do n't mean carriers fighting cities etc   i 'm a lawyer and there 's a complex legal side when it comes to easements   an easement is a way to allow others access to your real property or land   this is a complex subject so i 'll skim it a little   you can have an easement for a variety of reasons one of them would be utilities   the gas water and electric companies usually have an easement to fix repair on a property   so if a storm knocks over a power pole they can go onto the property to fix it without or needing special permission   you can also have an easement if for example you own a piece of land that is blocked by another piece of land from access to a road   you can have an easement granting you a driveway across the land that blocks you   there are many more examples and lots and lots of rules for easements but you get the picture   when you set up a big fiber network you are going to need easements to run it around and to be able to go onto properties to fix it   this is complex takes a long time money is often exchanged for easements and they have to be recorded with the county   this takes a lot of time and money   that 's not all   you usually have to go through permitting with the city and then you have to figure out where to run it   can you use utility poles   maybe the existing poles wo n't work and you 'll have to install new ones   if you want to underground it you 're going to have to do all the permitting and easements then you 're going to have to look into shutting down streets to work you 're going to have to find all the underground sewer water gas and other utility lines so you do n't accidentally cut into them there will be environmental regulations and you 're going to have to restore where you were digging   and i 've probably left a few things out   this stuff is complex expensive and takes a long time   a company like google can afford it because they can lay out cash for a few years before it starts generating revenue   personally i think the federal government needs to get involved   the feds were involved in and running telephone service   i do n't think this is any different   it also would help the federal government as well as state county and city governments they all need communication networks too   i would build an agency like the old or ccc to deploy fiber across america   it would take several years but this is one of those government projects that would produce results just like how did

as far as i agree to everyone saying that you should stop borrowing etc i see a lot of sense of getting balance transfer cards if you are actually paying it off considering a scenario you have a cc with balance of $ 5000 on each at roughly interest which results in interest per year your minimum due is where you are paying $ 100 mo for only interest and ~$10 mo to cover your balance if minimum is all you can pay with your current cash flow yes do a balance transfer assuming your transfer cost is 3 and 0 interest for 21 months as many ccs do now your cost will be $ 150 but paying off $ 110 month for 21 months you will pay off roughly $ 2000 off your balance instead of if you were paying only your minimum due after 21 months you 'll have a balance of instead of $ 4800 and then you can repeat if your cash flow gets better please make as many more bigger payments any time you can to reduce the balance and you 'll pay off sooner

11 111 looks like the old tax number it is used by the tax office to know who you are it is n't good at all for the spanish company it would even change when you move inside germany   vat ids are not exclusive to but a always has one as freelancers you can get at vat id but you do n't always have to   the tax office offers a small business treatment 19 for freelancers kind of an opt out for the vat id as you do not have a vat id this is probably your case it means so what to do if i were you i 'd write them that according to 19 and the european council directive of 28 november 2006 on the common system of value added tax title chapter 1 special scheme for small enterprises you were not assigned a vat id and vat is not applicable to your bill the fact that vat is not applicable in this case does not mean that they are allowed to refuse payment   i heard a but do n't really know that a number similar to the vat id is planned also for freelancers you could go to your tax office and ask them about maybe that yields a number that satisfies spanish afaik you can go to your tax office and ask them to give you a real vat number   but careful that has the serious drawback that you have to do do an advance vat estimate and pay that to the tax office at least quarterly for bigger business monthly and afaik you are not allowed to change back to the small business treatment for several years

from what these people are saying it is impossible for you to put $ 5,500 in if it were a roth though because the money has to be taxed you are correct that this is wrong   you can still put $ 5,500 in a roth the tax payment comes when you file not when you make the investment   this is when the roth is better than a traditional ira when you can invest the max either way   yes you get the tax break for the traditional investment and if you invest the tax savings you 'll be in the same spot all else being equal if you only have a certain amount after taxes to invest say $ 3,000 in a 25 marginal tax bracket then it works out the same either way   you can either invest $ 3,000 in a roth and let it grow tax free or put $ 4,000 in a traditional ira since you can deduct $ 1,000 15 from your taxes when you file then your tax adjusted balance when you withdraw is the same since you 'll have a lot more 33 more in fact in your traditional ira but will have to pay tax on the withdrawals

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

it depends on the terms of the lease but it 's hard to imagine a lease that would allow to do this unilaterally with no strings attached   that means it actually depends not on how much you like your but on how much she likes you in general by signing the lease you assume a contractual obligation to pay the rent every month for the entire term of the lease   in theory you can be sued if you do n't do that in practice a lot depends on your relationship with your landlord as well as the rental market in your area   if the landlord can easily find a replacement tenant they may be willing to allow you to leave early   if the rental market is slow they will be more likely to hold you to the agreement   obviously if you have a good relationship with the landlord they may be more inclined to go easy on you as far as telling your you want to terminate the lease early unless she 's a particularly nasty person you can just go ahead and tell her you 'd like to leave early   what you ca n't do is actually stop paying rent   if you 're on reasonably good terms with your you could just tell her your situation and say you 'd like to move out   she may be willing to work out an arrangement where she lists the apartment while you 're still living there allows prospective tenants to view it while it 's occupied and then has you move out if and when someone else wants to move in e.g. at the end of the month   again exactly how this works will probably depend on the rental market assuming you 're in the usa here is a useful page with some info on breaking a lease   as mentioned there the legal details vary by state

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

to add to what other have stated i recently just decided to purchase a home over renting some more and i 'll throw in some of my thoughts about my decision to buy i closed a couple of weeks ago note that i live in texas and that i 'm not knowledgeable in real estate other than what i learned from my experiences in the area when i am located it depends on the market and location you have to compare what renting will get you for the money vs what buying will get you for me buying seemed like a better deal overall when just comparing monthly payments this is including insurance and taxes you will need to stay at a house that you buy for at least 5 7 years you first couple years of payments will go almost entirely towards interest it takes a while to build up equity if you can pay more towards a mortgage do it you need to have money in the bank already to close the minimum down payment at least in my area is 3.5 for an fha loan if you put 20 down you do n't need to pay mortgage insurance which is essentially throwing money away you will also have add in closing costs i ended up purchasing a new construction my monthly payment went up from $ 1200 to $ 1600 after taxes insurance etc but the house is bigger newer more energy efficient much closer to my work in a more expensive area and in a market that is expected to go up in value i had all of my closing costs except for the deposit taken care of by the lender and builder so all of my closing costs i paid out of pocket went to the deposit equity or the bank if i decide to move and need to sell then i will get a lot losing some to selling costs and interest of the money i have put in to the house back out of it when i do sell and i have the option to put that money towards another house to sum it all up i 'm not paying a difference in monthly costs because i bought a house i had my closing costs taking care of and just had to pay the deposit which goes to equity i will have to do maintenance myself but i do n't mind fixing what i can fix and i have a builder 's warranties on most things in the house   to really get a good idea of whether you should rent or buy you need to talk to a realtor and compare actual costs it will be more expensive in the short term but should save you money in the long term

there are very strict regulations that requires the assets which a fund buys on behalf of its investors to be kept completely separate from the fund 's own assets which it uses to pay its expenses except for the published fees funds are typically audited regularly to ensure this is the case so the only way in which a default of the fund could cause a loss of money would be if the fund managers broke the regulations and committed various crimes i 've never heard of this actually happening to a normal mutual fund there is of course also a default risk when a fund buys bonds or other non equity securities and this may sometimes be non obvious for example some etfs which are nominally based on a stock index do n't actually buy stocks instead they buy or sell options on those stocks which involves a counterparty risk the etf may or may not have rules that limit the exposure to any one counterparty

on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

when debit cards were first made available one of the advertised strengths was that if you never wrote a check and always used a debit card you could never be overdrawn they money would be instantly withdrawn from the account and the balance would always reflect perfectly the amount of money in the account of course some saw the loss of float as a weakness but for others this instantaneous aspect was what they needed   if only that were true i have seen debit card transactions take a couple of days to appear i have seen a $ 1 hold for gas not be removed and the real amount withdrawn for 2 or 3 days horror stories about having a $ 3 coffee end up costing $ 30 because of overdraft fees can only occur if the transactions are n't instant   the contactless feature does n't make the time delay any shorter the delay for an individual transaction assuming there are no unusual network problems still depend on the vendor policies the card network policies and the bank policies but from the viewpoint of the cashier the transaction has been completes and the customer can leave with their coffee from the viewpoint of the bank account it may still be waiting

there are certain situations where you could legally pay yourself rent but it 'd be in the context of multiple business entities interacting never in the context of an individual renting their own property   even if you could any rent paid to yourself would count as rental income so there 'd be no benefit edit i was hunting for examples where it might be acceptable and did n't but i found a good explanation as to why it is not acceptable from brandon hall on a post to get technical you will be going up against the economic substance    doctrine which states that a transaction has economic substance if    1 the transaction changes in a meaningful way apart from federal    income tax effects the taxpayer ’s economic position and 2 the    taxpayer has a substantial purpose apart from federal income tax    effects for entering into such transaction by transferring your primary residence into a llc you would not be    changing your economic position further you do not have a    substantial purpose for entering into such transaction other than to    simply avoid paying federal income taxes so it might make sense if multiple people owned the llc that owned the property you wanted to rent and there are instances where company x owns holding company y that owns an office building that company x rents space in but if you 're the sole player in the llc 's then it sounds like a no go

companies usually have a minimum account balance required to keep a 401k for former employees you will have to check whether $ 10k is sufficient to keep your funds in your former employer 's 401k if you are below their threshold you will have to move your money one option is to rollover into the new employer 's 401k   you can rollover a 401k into a traditional ira account that is independent of your employer a traditional ira has the same tax benefits as a 401k it grows tax free until you withdraw money from the account companies that offer iras include vanguard fidelity tiaa   many companies have significant overhead costs in the their 401k management it may be better for you to rollover your money into an ira to save on these costs   i am not knowledgeable about loaning from retirement accounts so i can not help with that

the answer to question 1 is yes you can always reduce your loan when you remortgage by introducing additional funds there is some possibility a relatively small charge might be applicable for managing the marginally more complex transfer but it should n't be too much the answer to question 2 is none of your over payment amounts would have gone on interest but you might incur penalty charges interest is only charged on the outstanding loan amount i.e. £ 100 k initially reducing to £ 85 k over 2 years in your example at the interest rate determined by your mortgage agreement there is no paying off interest as such over payments are essentially all capital payments reducing the principal loan amount so no additional interest would be paid if you opted for over payments if you used your £ 10 k to made the over payments throughout the 2 year fixed period you would in fact have paid less interest by the end of the 2 years because you would be reducing the loan amount at a quicker rate and thus the interest you pay each month based on the lower outstanding loan at that time would be lower but over payments might have attracted over payment penalties typically a percentage of the amount you pay and these penalties often mean it 's not worth doing most fixed term mortgages have such penalties but it depends on the agreement and many mortgages also allow you to make over payments up to a certain amount each year before you get hit edit additional suggestion if the example you provide is one based on what you expect might happen to you over the next couple of years something you could consider is an offset mortgage here your £ 10 k that you accumulate reduces your interest through the 2 years but you keep it in savings where you can access it if you need to accessing it will then cause a corresponding rise in interest payments but to no higher level than you would have been paying if you had nothing in the savings in the first place you usually pay a slightly higher interest rate for these sort of mortgage so it 's impossible to know if it would be more economical and how appropriate it would be for you in other respects depends on many factors

after doing this many times my preferred method is the reason being that the us banks will use every chance possible to take your money in fees usually the german bank website will tell you what the current exchange rate you were correct in selecting transfer in $ and got the exchange rate in my experience if you transfer in euros the us bank at the other end will take about 3 5 because they can selecting our means that you only have the fee taken out by the source bank by doing shared it looks like both banks took their full fee if you chose our i 'm fairly certain you just would have paid the 1.50 and the 20 chase would not have taken the 15

i think the part of your question about not wanting to mess up more is the most important element you say you know someone with good credit who is willing to co sign for you but let 's be honest your credit is n't bad for no reason   your credit 's bad because you have a history of not paying on your obligations putting someone else 's credit at risk even though they may be willing to try and help could be doing exactly what you said you 're trying to avoid messing up more   this person 's heart is in the right place but you really have to ask yourself if you should put them in jeopardy by agreeing to guarantee your debts so the vehicle you bought is older and has a lot of miles you knew that when you bought it   so you 're paying a high interest rate because of your bad credit history you knew that when you bought it   why you think the vehicle 's only going to last another year is what confuses me   there are many vehicles out there with much higher mileage that are still on the road and with proper preventative maintenance there 's no reason your truck ca n't do the same the fact is you just do n't like what you 're paying or what you 're driving even though you were good with both when someone was willing to extend you credit so now you see this other person 's willingness to co sign for you as your ticket out of a situation you no longer want to be in my suggestion is that you stay with the loan you have take care of the vehicle to make it last and prove that you can pay your obligations   hopping from loan to loan is n't going to do your credit any favors   one of the big factors for your credit score is the average age of accounts   going and signing a new loan now will only drag that number down and hurt your score not help it   and there 's no guarantee the next car you buy with your friend 's help is going to last the length of that loan either i would be careful about this grass is greener on the other side attitude and just bear through your situation if only to prove to yourself that you can do it    there 's nothing saying your friend wo n't still be willing to co sign for you later on down the line of something does happen to the truck but you can show them that you 're trying to be responsible in the meantime by following through on what you already agreed to

the old truck is collateral for a loan the place that made the loan expects that if you ca n't pay they can repossess that old truck if you sell it they ca n't repossess it   the dealer needs clean title to be able to buy the truck from you so they can fix up the truck and sell it to somebody else i am assuming the the lender has filed paperwork with the state to show their lien on the title your options are three as to option 2 if the deal still makes sense the new car dealer can send the $ 9,000 to the lender that you forgot about that will of course increase the amount of money you have to borrow   you will also run into the problem that this loan that you forgot to mention on your credit application may cause them to rethink the decision to loan you the money

it depends on your cost structure and knowledge of the exchanges it could be optimal to make a manual exchange selection so long as it 's cheaper to do so for brokers with trade fees this is a lost cause because the cost of the trade is already so high that auto routing will be no cheaper than manual routing for brokers who charge extra to manually route this could be a good policy if the exchange chosen has very high rebates   this does not apply to equities because they are so cheap but there are still a few expensive option exchanges this all presumes that one 's broker shares exchange rebates which nearly all do not if one has direct access to the exchanges they are presumably doing this already to do this effectively one needs for anyone trading with brokers without shared rebates or who does not have knowledge of the exchange prices and their it 's best to auto route

this is a really interesting question and something a lot of work is being done to understand   i 'm going to look at the closely related question do non market cap etf weighting methods consistently outperform once you take into account their investment biases let 's use revenue weighting as a reason why investment biases are so important   in revenue weighting you would own almost no fast growing tech companies as they generally have little revenue    this sounds great if we are talking about say pets.com in the late 90s but you also would miss most of the rise of google to believe in these etfs consistently outperform adjusted for risk you would have to have a strong reason to believe that earnings sales or dividends are a better predictor of company value than market value   market analysts include the above three metrics and many more when pricing stocks so out performance using only one of the above metrics seems unlikely there is one caveat to this and that is value and small cap stocks have been shown to give slightly better risk adjusted returns in the very long run see fama french and many of these alternative weighting methods will have a value or small cap bias   first it is unclear if this out performance will continue now that it is more widely known   second even if you believe this will continue you can more easily and cheaply get this bias though value small cap etfs than these weighting schemes in the end the only thing that is perfectly clear is that higher fee investments will generally under perform

there are 3 entities in a credit card transaction typically when you swipe for 100 the merchant only gets around the 2.5 is divided amongst the 3 entities roughly around 0.5 for the merchant bank around 0.5 for the card network and a lions share to issuing bank of around 1.5 the reason issuing bank gets large share is because they take the risk and provide the credit to customer typically the issuing bank would pay the merchant bank via the card network the money in couple of days so the merchant bank is not out of funds the issuing bank on the other hand would have given you a credit of say 10 to 50 days depending on when you made the transaction and when the payment is due on an average 30 days of credit so roughly the acquiring bank is lending money at the rate of 18 it is from this money the issuing bank would give out rewards which is typically less than 1 also in cases where say merchant bank and the issuing bank are same bank would make money on both the legs of transaction and hence launch co branded cards with better rewards the above numbers are illustrative and actual practices vary from bank to bank to card network to country related question at how do credit card companies make profit

pro tip managers hate to keep expensive cars on their books because expensive cars = more depreciation = bad margins however if you call the branch a day in advance the morning of your reservation and mention that you are interested in coverages and upgrading to something you will instantly become a vip for agents and managers that are desperate to boost sales numbers they will do everything they can to track down whatever car you want when you arrive simply decline the coverages you do n't want and negotiate seriously negotiate a fair price for your upgrade

you are making an assumption that may not be true to me some apartment debt i paid had already been sold to a collections agency before i actually paid it typically debts are sold to a debt buyer whereas a collection agency works on commission to collect debts on behalf of the creditor if your debt was actually sold you should have been notified in writing of this fact and who the new creditor was i suspect your debt was not sold because if it was the apartment complex would not have been legally allowed to cash your check when you finally paid them therefore it is most likely that the collection agency was working on commission and the apartment complex never informed them that you had settled your debt as for what to do about it here are 3 options ordered by likelihood of success good luck and if you do n't mind please update us later on what you did and what the result was your experience will be helpful for others having this issue in the future

all value given to products is subjective and is different from person to person   it can also vary for the same person from year to year month to month day to day or even hour to hour as a person analyzes different products and prices to determine which imparts the most value to him or her at a given point in time in regards to losing money in your investment accounts   this reminds of a book i read on jesse livermore   jesse was a famous stock broker who made millions in the 1920 's so he would be a billionaire in today 's money in the stock market multiple times   jesse felt like   you he felt like after a while the losses on paper did not seem to concern him as much as he thought it should   he thought it was due to the investment accounts being simply being numbers on papers and not cold hard cash so what did jesse do to remove the abstract nature of investment accounts    from here livermore always sold out all his positions at the end of every year    and had the cash deposited in his account at the chase manhattan bank    then he would arrange with the bank to have the money in cash in the    bank ’s vault in chests there was a desk a chair a cot and an easy    chair in the middle of the cash on the occasion described in    there was $ 50 million in cash   in the corner was a fridge with food    enough for a few days there was lighting installed then like    scrooge livermore would have himself locked in the vault with    his cash he would stay a couple of days and review his year from    every aspect   after his stay was over he would fill his pockets with cash and go on    a shopping spree    he would also take   a vacation and not re enter    the market until february but unlike scrooge this was not the act of a miser explains      livermore lived a world of paper transactions all year long    he believed that by the end of the year he had lost his perception of    what the paper slips really represented cash money and ultimately    power   he needed to touch the money and feel the power of cash it    made him re appraise his stock and commodity positions imagine the $ 60,000 from your investment account sitting on your kitchen table   imagine seeing $ 1,000 dumped into the trash can one day   i know i would appreciate the money much more seeing that happen

much more than that   last i looked at this i saw the dji have fat tails i.e. non gaussian to the order of hundreds of days   the effect becomes less pronounced the larger the interval and the curves show that it becomes more gaussian   if you plot the return distributions for 1-day etc on a plot you end up with curves that look like figure of figure 1.3 edit sorry i got the figure wrong     the gaussian curve on a plot comes out as a i.e. the black curve   non gaussian fat tails fan out like the green red and blue plots   the out occurs even when dealing with returns over a couple of hundred days but the effect becomes less pronounced suggesting a convergence to gaussian

i think the primary reason you 're being down voted is because of the way you address people who align themselves with left wing ideology   let 's either call them all foolish or none of them   i prefer calling them all foolish one stream lined school of thought is rather     anyway your points on equality are spot on theoretically applicants based on values that should already be overlooked is introducing a bias to correct another bias it 's a short term strategy and for what it 's worth i agree with you   that is i would if racism did n't exist in practice   the problem is what is actually observed in the real world all too often better candidates for a job are excluded in favor for those who are of similar religion or race as the employer when the cast offs would perform better at the job   it is virtually never the other way around where someone of a weaker skill set is forced on the job to fill a government implemented quota and if it is the case it is also usually done deliberately choosing a very weak candidate to appeal to the government in attempts to themselves from those particular laws     my focus point   and sure it 's your choice as an employer to bring on whoever you want that 's piece of mind for you the employer you 've created the company that you wanted but it 's not the best it could be in terms of production purposes for society because the employer has n't assembled the best possible work force with it 's available applicants   it is here that we see there are negative externalities on the public as inefficiency rises due to class race gender favoritism being chosen over ability   employing people to help create your master vision fundamentally incorporates compromise for the betterment of society

historical volatility of a stock is going to be based on past performance basically its current trend   that can be useful but really is no indication of how it will perform in the future   especially with a big swing in the market now if you 're talking about implied volatility iv of an options contract that 's a little different   iv is derived from an option ’s price and shows what the market implies about the stock ’s volatility in the future thus it is based on the actions of active traders and market makers   so it gives you a bit more insight into what 's going on but at times has less to do with fundamentals i guess a good way to think of iv based on options contracts is as an educated opinion of the market as a whole with regards to how much that stock could likely move over a period of time options expiration also note that iv represents the potential for a stock to move but it does not forecast direction i do n't know of any studies off the top of my head but i 'm sure there have been plenty

# 457549
i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes
