i suggest that you use your own judgement on this you can assign a reasonable percentage since it is impossible to monitor the hours using those assets example 40 personal and 60 for business it 's really your call i also suggest that you should be conservative on valuing the assets record the assets at it 's lowest value this is one of the most difficult scenarios in making your own financial statements you can also use this approach i will record the assets at its original cost then use a higher depreciation rate or double declining method of depreciation if the assets have a depreciation rate of 20 per year useful life of 5 years i will make it 30 the other 10 will add more expense and helps you not to overstate your financial statement you can also use the residual value of the asset but if you do this you should figure out the reliable amount i understand that this is not for tax reporting purposes therefore there 's no harm if you overstate your financial statement and even if you overstate you can still adjust the cost of the asset along the way in the middle of the year or year end you will figure out the cost of the asset if it 's over valued once the financial statement is done

does the friend fix your electrical wiring and the engine of your car if you need a professional advice ask a professional in this case an accountant not necessarily a cpa but at least an experienced bookkeeper financial statements official documents that is must be signed by a public accountant cpa in the us or the principle you i would n't take chances and would definitely have an accountant do that you need to consider the asset useful life and the depreciation the fact that you use it for non business purposes may be recorded in various ways one that comes to mind is accounting as a supplement for depreciation you depreciate the percentage that is used for business and record as a distribution to owner the rest which is accounting for the personal use this way it would also match the tax reporting in the us at least bottom line if you 're preparing an official financial statement that you 're going to submit to anyone other than yourself get a professional advice

always use limit orders never market orders period do that and you will always pay what you said you would when the transaction goes through whichever broker you use is not going to negotiate for the best price on your trade if you choose a market order   their job is to fill that order so they will always buy it for more than market and sell it for less to ensure the order goes through it is not even a factor when choosing between tradeking and scottrade i use trade king and my friend uses   besides the transaction fee tk is a few $ $ cheaper the only other things to consider are the tools and research and customer service if you need it that each site offers i went with tk and the lower transaction fee since tools and research can be had from other sources i basically only use it when i want to make a trade since i do n't find the tools particularly useful and i never take an analyst 's opinion of a stock at face value anyway since everybody always has their own agenda

the rev rule allows companies to fully restate transition years but does n't actually require it it allows them to just do a one time adjustment to retained earning instead which is what most companies are doing will do   lots of huge companies have adopted earlier than they had to so they clearly saw some benefit in doing so i think some are absolutely considering the benefits of a superficial bump in the transition year    obviously not a huge shift in long term earnings though

a long time ago in a galaxy far far away rollover iras were used for funds that came from were rolled over from a 401(k account or a 403(b account all that money including any earnings in the interim could be rolled over into a 401(k plan with a new employer etc   one could make a regular contribution to a rollover ira but once such a commingling of money occurred none of the money in the rollover ira could be rolled over into a 401(k account etc in those good old days when contributions to iras were made by paper check and deposit slip one had to write a letter to the rollover ira custodian certifying that the ira owner understood that the contribution would destroy forever the possibility of rolling over the money into another 401(k etc all this went by the a few years ago when the law changed and the distinction between rollover iras and ordinary traditional iras was eliminated commingling of ira contributions and rollover money from 401(k)s are permitted and the entire ira balance could be rolled over into a new 401(k plan provided the new plan accepted rollovers however the still persist like i too have iras that are still called rollover ira they all have commingled funds and if the law ever changes back none of those ira accounts would be eligible for rolling over into a new 401(k

when you exercise a put you get paid the strike price immediately so you can invest that money and earn some interest compared to only exercising at expiry so the benefit to exercising early is that extra interest the cost is the remaining time value of the option along with any dividend payments you miss as @joetaxpayer points out there might be tax considerations that make it better to exercise at one time rather than another but those would likely be personal to you so if the option would intrinsically have more value unexercised in many cases you could sell it on rather than exercise it the exception might be if it was n't very liquid and the transaction costs of doing that outweighed the theoretical value

the answer depends on this if you had to hire someone to do what you are doing in the s corp what would you pay them   if you are doing semi unskilled work part time then $ 20k might be reasonable   if you are a professional working full time it 's too low   do n't forget that in addition to billable work you are also doing office tasks such as invoicing and bookkeeping that the irs will also want to see you getting paid for there was an important court ruling on this subject recently watson v. commissioner   watson owned an s corp where he was the sole employee   the s corp itself was a 25 owner in a very successful accounting firm that watson worked through   all of the revenue that watson generated at the accounting firm was paid to the s corp which then paid watson through salary and distributions   watson was paying himself $ 24k a year in salary and taking over $ a year in distributions   for comparison even first year accountants at the firm were making more than $ 24k a year in salary   the irs determined that this salary amount was too low   to determine an appropriate amount for watson 's salary the irs did a study of the salaries of peers in firms of the same size as the firm watson was working with taking into account that owners of firms earn a higher salary than non owners   the number that the irs arrived at was $   watson was allowed to take the rest $ each year as distributions again this number was based on a study of the salaries of peers   it was far short of the $ 200k+ that the s corp was pulling in from the accounting firm   clearly watson was paying himself far too low of a salary   but even at this extreme example where watson 's s corp was directly getting all of its revenue from one accounting firm in which watson was an owner the irs still did not conclude that all of the revenue should have been salary and subject to payroll taxes you should ask an accountant or attorney for advice   they can help you determine an appropriate amount for your salary   do n't be afraid of an audit but make sure that you can defend your choices if you do get audited if your choices are based on professional advice that will help your case   see these articles for more information

there are certain situations where you could legally pay yourself rent but it 'd be in the context of multiple business entities interacting never in the context of an individual renting their own property   even if you could any rent paid to yourself would count as rental income so there 'd be no benefit edit i was hunting for examples where it might be acceptable and did n't but i found a good explanation as to why it is not acceptable from brandon hall on a post to get technical you will be going up against the economic substance    doctrine which states that a transaction has economic substance if    1 the transaction changes in a meaningful way apart from federal    income tax effects the taxpayer ’s economic position and 2 the    taxpayer has a substantial purpose apart from federal income tax    effects for entering into such transaction by transferring your primary residence into a llc you would not be    changing your economic position further you do not have a    substantial purpose for entering into such transaction other than to    simply avoid paying federal income taxes so it might make sense if multiple people owned the llc that owned the property you wanted to rent and there are instances where company x owns holding company y that owns an office building that company x rents space in but if you 're the sole player in the llc 's then it sounds like a no go

a savings account and a checking account or a demand account or a transactional account have different regulations   for example fractional reserve requirements are 10 against checking accounts but 0 against savings accounts   the theory is that savings accounts are sticky while checking accounts are hot money so the fed wants to stop banks from creating accounts that are regulated as savings accounts but have the features of checking accounts   in the past this was done by banks to pay interest on checking accounts   they eliminated that rule back in the inflation years and instead imposed the rule that to qualify as a savings accounts for regulatory purposes banks must discourage you from using them as transactional accounts   for example by limiting the number of withdrawals per month that can be made from a savings account if the fed gave up on trying to enforce a distinction i suspect there would soon no longer be a distinction

the main reason is that you move from the linear payoff structure to a non linear one this is called convexity in finance with options you can design a payoff structure in almost any way to want it to be for example you can say that you only want the upside but not the downside so you buy a call option it is obvious that this comes at a price the option premium or equivalently you buy the underlying and for risk management reasons buy a put option on top of it as an insurance the price of the put could be seen as the insurance premium you can of course combine options in more complicated ways so that you e.g. profit as long as the underlying moves strongly enough in either direction this is called a straddle

you would have paid $ plus commission in this case and made $ 85 before commissions how much you would have made on expiration depends on the price that tsla has on april 1 which has n't come yet   if it expires worthless you typically do n't pay a commission but you will have lost the full $   if it expires in the money and you want to exercise it then you would pay a commission often different than the commission to buy sell the option itself and you would have 100 shares of tsla   you wo n't know how much you make or lose in this case until you ultimately sell the shares of tsla

if there were no contribution limits you could shelter practically all of your income from income tax the government would not have sufficient tax revenue hence there are limits which ensure some personal income remains taxable today similarly when you retire there are rules for minimum required distributions withdrawals which ensure the government gets to tax some of your income each year in your retirement depending on the account type one other advantage of limits is to encourage people to approach saving for retirement using regular ongoing contributions made in the context of each year 's limit the limit in a sense can be a form of guidance some aim to contribute to the limit and some even save beyond it using plain taxable investments

the article states their reasons pretty clearly and indicates that some people wo n't qualify under the new requirements that would have previously they 're not people with bad credit they 're just looking beyond credit score at other factors they are n't opening for anyone with a pulse to get a car loan just shifting things a bit to cast a slightly wider net this is not new in the world of secured debt the fha has methodology for establishing a non traditional credit report based on things like rental history utility payments auto insurance payments a person ca n't be declined an fha loan for lack for lack of traditional credit history i look beyond credit score as a landlord a tenant with poor credit but a stellar rental history is more appealing than someone with great credit but a bad rental history vehicles and housing are very important to people so they are likely to prioritize them above credit card payments or hospital bills time will tell but it seems like a solid move in my view they can refine their model over time and likely find a solid customer base among those who would n't qualify on credit score alone

the best thing to do is to completely pay off one credit card then apply the left over to the highest interest card after that all of your expenses that can be put on a credit card should be put on the one that you just paid off at the end of the month pay off a different credit card and the highest interest and move all your purchasing to that card keep going around the circle until you are able to pay them all off doing this will be good for your credit score as the debt on the cards will now be new   if you 're really desperate to increase your credit score e.g. refinancing a house you can use balance transfers to temporarily make it appear that you have zero debt but it will cost you some money typically balance transfers cost something like $ 35 + 2

if you have significant assets such as a large deposit then diversification of risks such as currency risk is good practice there are many good options but keeping 100 of it in is definitely not a good idea nor is keeping 100 of it in a single foreign currency   of course it would be much more beneficial to have done it yesterday and moments of extreme volatility generally are a bad time to make large uninformed trades but if the deposit is sufficiently large say equal to annual expenses then it would make sense to split it among different currencies and also different types of assets as well deposit stocks precious metals bonds the rate of rouble may go up and down but you also have to keep in mind that future events such as fluctuating oil price may risk a much deeper crisis than now and you can look to experiences of the 1998 crisis as an example of what may happen if the situation continues to deteriorate

full payment is always better than auto loan if you are prudent with finances i.e if you take a loan you are factoring the emi hence your savings will remain as is however if you manage well you can buy the car with cash and at the same time put aside the notional emi as savings and investments the other factor to consider is what return your cash is giving if this more than auto loan interest rate post taxes you should opt for loan for example if auto loan is 10 and you are getting a return of 15 after taxes on investment then loan is better company car lease depends on terms more often you get break on taxes on the emi component but you have to buy at the end of lease period and re register the car in your name so there is additional cost some companies give lease at very favourable rates plus if you leave the job lease has to be broken and it becomes more expensive

i 'm impressed   she must have a substantial income to agree to a $ 500/month car payment   i imagine her income is about 20 k per month for that to make sense   what kind of work does she do   to answer your question typical lease do not work the way you describe   paying an extra $ 2000 will allow you to skip 4 payments provided the payments were exactly $ 500 any time in the future   it does not modify the terms of the lease which would include the payment amount   also one does not receive a fiance charge reduction benefit as with a loan   essentially you are providing a loan to the leasing company for free to be explicit you can not tell the mortgage company anything as she is applying for the loan not you   she can tell the mortgage company the new payment is $ 400 but she would be falsifying the application which is not advisable perhaps the mortgage company is doing her a favor   they are indicating her life is out of control financially   either she is attempting to purchase way to much home or her consumer debt is out of control   it could be a combination of both    my first paragraph was written to be tongue in check in order to demonstrate absurdity   without a substantial income and an substantial net worth a 500/month car payment is simply ridiculous   while it is someone average when you compare it to the average income year you understand why 78 of us households live paycheck to paycheck are broke and have no retirement savings for your and her sake please stop giving all your hard earned money to banks

first you should diversify your portfolio   if your entire portfolio is in the roth ira then you should eventually diversify that   however if you have an ira and a 401k then it 's perfectly fine for the ira to be in a single fund   for example i used my ira to buy a riskier reit that my 401k does n't support    second if you only have a small amount currently invested e.g. $ 5500 it may make sense to put everything in a single fund until you have enough to get past the low balance fees   it 's not uncommon for funds to charge lower fees to someone who has $ 8000 $ 10,000 or $ 12,000 invested   note that if you deposit $ 10,000 and the fund loses money they 'll usually charge you the rate for less than $ 10,000   so try to exceed the minimum with a decent cushion    a balanced fund may make sense as a first fund   that way they handle the diversification for you   a targeted fund is a special kind of balanced fund that changes the balance over time   some have reported that targeted funds charge higher fees   commissions on those higher fees may explain why your bank wants you to buy    i personally do n't like the asset mixes that i 've seen from targeted funds   they often change the stock bond ratio which is not really correct   the stock bond ratio should stay the same   it 's the securities stocks and bonds to monetary equivalents that should change and that only starting five to ten years before retirement   prior to that the only reason to put money into monetary equivalents is to provide time to pick the right securities fund   retirees should maintain about a five year cushion in monetary equivalents so as not to be forced to sell into a bad market    long term i 'd prefer low load index funds   a bond fund and two or three stock funds   you might want to build your balance first though   it does n't really make sense to have a separate fund until you have enough money to get the best fees   70 75 stocks and 25 30 bonds should add to 100 e.g. 73 and 27   balance annually when you make your new deposit

not to detract from the other answers at all which are each excellent and useful in their own right but here 's my interpretation of the ideas equity is the answer to the question where is the value of the company coming from   this might include owner stakes shareholder stock investments or outside investments   in the current moment it can also be defined as equity = x + current income current expenses i 'll come back to x this fits into the standard accounting model of assets liabilities = value equity where assets includes not only bank accounts but also warehouse inventory raw materials etc liabilities are debts loans shortfalls in inventory etc   both are abstract categories whereas income and expense are hard dollar amounts   at the end of the year when the books balance they should all equal out equity up until this point has been an abstract concept and it 's not an account in the traditional gnucash sense   however it 's common practice for businesses to close the books once a year and to consolidate outstanding balances   when this happens equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value how much is the company worth at this moment which has a definite numeric value when the books are opened fresh for a new business year the current income and current expense amounts are zeroed out   in this situation in order for the big equation to equal out assets liabilities = x + income the previous net value of the company must be accounted for   this is where x comes in the starting previous year 's equity   this allows the assets and liabilities to be non zero while the current income and expenses are both still zeroed out   the account which represents x in gnucash is called equity and encompasses not only initial investments but also the net increase decreases from previous years   while the name would more accurately be called starting equity the only problem caused by the naming convention is the confusion of the concept equity x + income expenses with the account x named equity

typically labor is a company 's largest expense so when a company receives tax cuts that does n't translate to more hiring long term if the company expands it might but it could also choose to invest in a better or different products maybe more efficient business processes or invest in overseas operations additionally labor has a diminishing value just because we could hire more people to make more things does n't mean we should    side note in many states the largest employers are the state local governments schools public services etc and healthcare providers   this tax cut is great for people that are already invested or high income earners because it lowers the overall tax brackets and aligns capital gains to those so say i had a million dollars invested and earned a yearly 10 dividend return i 'd earn 100k in dividends and pay 25 as income tax source   however something like 50 of all americans are invested in the stock market only the top 10 average investments close to a million in investments example above and 38 of all investments are owned by the 1 source   tax cuts while popular would n't ever help stimulate consumer spending esp considering the amount of consumer debt that exists ~1 trillion what these tax cuts would do create more debt for tax payers

good question your assumptions are a bit off track though i am sure you would agree that automation will occur gradually allowing a new workforce that is with relevant skills to support automation tech and operations to bubble up this workforce will drive up consumer spending offsetting your assumption of diminishing consumer spending    the extent to which this new workforce will offset diminishing consumer spending of the being laid off is a matter of debate but one thing is certain consumer spending albeit relatively weaker or stronger will exist and businesses will continue to thrive another possibility is that the workforce getting laid off might be in other sectors of the economy or better yet some companies might re train some of it    the assumption that most of the jobs will be automated does n't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss some automation will actually drive up productivity which will increase the margin of companies in light of this logic we can assume that employees will be paid more increasing their disposable income     the bottom line is that consumer spending is unlikely to bottom out it might weaken or strengthen for one or two reasons but people will continue consuming and businesses will thrive

educating everyone is a cultural investment but not necessarily a good fiscal investment for the govt   200 years ago being able to read and perform arithmetic pretty much guaranteed you an ok job because it was a rare skillset   the government decided that everyone being able to read and do basic maths would be a good thing so they force us all to pay for it and they force us all to attend school so most of the country has a basic education that 's obviously a good thing but it does n't guarantee everyone in the country a good job if 1000 's of people have the same skillset and are all applying for the same job it 's impossible to differentiate job candidates in the job market a skill that everyone has is effectively valueless    the same thing is happening with college we have tons of college graduates that are all applying for the exact same jobs and we as a society have produced more people to do that small group of jobs and have n't produced any people to do other jobs somewhat ironically immigrant workers do a lot of the work we should be doing ourselves but we all went to college and all want to do the same good high paying etc jobs and there 's too many of us and not very much demand for the skills we can deliver   so giving secondary educations to even more people would n't be a bad thing in and of itself but it would n't help anyone find work

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it

generally to be able to write off worthless securities you need to show that they 're indeed worthless it 's not necessarily easy as you need to prove that there 's no way they will regain any value in the future what is usually done instead is very simple you sell them many brokers are aware of this problem and will assist by buying these securities from you at a nominal price e*trade for example for $ 0.01 scottrade for $ 0.00 and providing a proper trade confirmation this is a bona fide sale so if the stock does regain value it will be a profit for the broker in this case you just report it as a sale at loss check with your broker if they support such a solution

13 or 30 the only real difference is that as a minor you are claimed as a dependent on your parent 's return so you do n't have you own exemption but you do have a standard deduction of $ 6300 when it comes to earned income yes you 'll pay taxes federal state and tax for social security   there 's nothing wrong with paying taxes in fact i hope you have to pay a small fortune in tax that would mean you 've made a large fortune and after taxes still got to keep a good chunk of it if your income is minimal you 'll actually pay very little in taxes not enough to even think about wanting to give away what you can sell

i recommend you take a look at this lecture really the whole series is enlightening from swenson he identifies 3 sources of returns diversification timing and selection he appears to discard timing and selection as impossible a student kinda calls him out on this diversification reduces risk not increase returns it turns out they did time the market by shorting .com 's before the bubble and real estate just before the downturn in 1990 yale started a absolute return unit and allocated like 15 percent to it mostly by selling us equities that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves as for why you might employ managers for specific areas consider that the expense ratio wall street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in yale 's portfolio so they hire internally to reduce expenses and i 'm sure they 're kept busy they also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge finally in some areas you functionally can not invest without management for example yale has a substantial allocation in private equity and by definition that does n't trade on the open market the other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009 for a technique that 's supposed to reduce volatility they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years

i have a couple other important considerations regarding external hsa accounts vs employer sponsored hsa accounts depending on your personal financial situation and goals some people like to use hsa accounts as an extra retirement account since the money can be withdrawn penalty free in retirement for non medical expenses and completely tax penalty free at any time for medical expenses if your intended use for the hsa account is an investment vehicle for retirement then you may find more use benefit out of an external provider that may provide more or better investment options than your employers hsa investment options there can be a lot of additional value in those extra investment options over greater periods of time another very important consideration for fica taxes fica includes social security medicare that i do n't believe was mentioned before for those earners who are under the maximum social security wage limit you are paying 6.2 of each paycheck into social security taxes as others have mentioned you can save this tax through your employer ’s plan if you set up the account to be funded pre tax from your paychecks however in doing so you are lowering your overall contributions into social security which may lower your social security benefits in your retirement years   if this is ultimately going to lower your ssa benefits in retirement then that is a big future cost that may steer you against the pre tax employer contributions think of social security as part of your retirement plan not as a tax but instead as an additional check you put away for yourself for retirement every month of course this is only an important consideration if ssa is still going to be around when you retire but let 's assume that it will be this is not an issue for higher earners earning well above the max ssa taxable wages there is no wage limit on the 1.45 medicare tax withholding 's and there is certainly no harm in saving medicare taxes because it will not affect future medicare benefits so for taxpayers earning well over the max ssa wages they will just save the 1.45 medicare taxes without affecting their ssa contributions and resulting retirement benefits   so again it all comes down to personal situations depending on your earnings and goals employer plan may or may not be the way to go   personally for my lower earning clients friends and family i tend to recommend that they do whatever they can to maximize their social security benefits in retirement so i would advise them to either use the external provider account or the employer plan but with post tax contributions so you do n't lower the ssa withholding 's but can still claim the income tax deduction on your tax return ymmv

short answer it depends it should generally be cheaper to get a loan directly from a bank but often a mortgage broker can find you deals that you might not be able to get with a local bank   if you are refinancing the cheapest option of all is usually to go through the bank that holds your existing mortgage as for how mortgage brokers make their money there are two ways   the first is on the front end through fees origination fees especially that go directly to them   the second and less obvious is on the back end   this is where they make money by giving you a loan at a slightly higher rate than the lender was willing to give you   so let 's say they find a lender that will give you a loan at 5.25   they offer that loan to you at 5.5 and pocket the extra .25 when the bank takes it over

i think you 're thinking that in debt does n't just mean owes a debt but somehow means owes more debt in total than the assets that condition owing money without offsetting assets is having a negative net worth if you have a mortgage then you have a debt and you are in debt you may have a positive net worth if you have equity in the house and your car and such like and have cash in the bank you may have a negative net worth if you owe more than you own but either way you are technically in debt knowing that it 's not surprising that 75 of americans are in debt it 's surprising that 25 are not they have no credit card no car loan no mortgage no line of credit no student loans is it because they 've paid all that off or because they are deadly poor and own nothing and ca n't be lent anything you ca n't just say it 's bad to have debt it 's bad to have too much debt to have a negative net worth to be in the habit of borrowing to finance a lifestyle you ca n't actually afford and so on but it 's perfectly normal to have a debt or two that 's how our system mostly works

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

with an annuity you invest directly into an annuity with money you have earned as wages salary etc you pay for it and trade your payments into the annuity for guaranteed payments from the annuity issuer in the future the more you pay in before the annuity payments begin the more you will receive for your annuity payment with a pension most often you invest implicitly rather than directly into the pension rather than making a cash contribution on a regular basis it is likely that your employer has periodically invested into the pension fund for you using monies that would otherwise have been paid to you if there were no pension system this is why your pension benefits are often determined based on years of service your rate of pay and similar factors

no it 's perhaps a bit obvious but with the shorter term loan you would be contractually obligated to pay the higher monthly payment by paying double on the longer loan you retain the flexibility to pay less and you would pay less interest if you truly doubled your payment on the longer loan this is because you 'd be paying off more of the principal more quickly but you 'd also be making a slightly higher payment than on the shorter term loan you can play with the amortization calculator at bankrate to understand this

yes you should be saving for retirement there are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount but i think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10 of your income which in your case is around $ 15,000 per year you give amounts in dollars are you in the u.s. if so there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or ira rather than ordinary savings or investments a often your employer will make matching contributions 50 up to 6 of your salary is pretty common i.e. if you put in 6 they put in 3 if either of your employers has such a plan that 's an instant 50 profit on your investment b any profits on money invested in an ira or 401k are tax free effectively the mechanics differ depending on the type of account so if you put $ 100,000 into an ira today and left it there until you retire 30 years later it would likely earn something like   $ 600,000 over that time assuming 7 per year growth so you 'd pay takes on your initial $ 100,000 but none on the $ 600,000 with your income you are likely in a high tax bracket that would make a huge difference if you 're saying that you just ca n't find a way to put money away for retirement may i suggest that you cut back on your spending i understand that the average american family makes about $ 45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that if you were to put 10 of your income toward retirement then you would be living on the remaining $ which is still almost 4 times what the average family has yeah i make more than $ 45,000 a year too and there are times when i think how could anyone possibly live on that but then i think about what i spend my money on did i really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months i certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month etc a tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account if the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan but if the reverse is true then you need to decide between likely returns and risk

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

if you want the new car pay cash for it here 's why by paying cash for the car you immediately save $ 2,500 off the price of the car that is not insignificant it 's off   by paying cash you 'll never be upside down on the car and you can sell the car anytime you want   you said that all you need to do is beat the 0.9 interest rate with your investment to come out ahead that does n't take into account the discount you would have gotten by paying cash $ 30,000 invested for 5 years at 1.6 rough estimate would get you $ 2,500 the discount so the rate you need to beat to come out ahead is actually 2.5 still doable but it is much less of a sure thing on a 5 year investment and much less worth the trouble   new cars are an expensive luxury if you are wealthy enough a new car certainly can be appropriate for you however if you do n't like the idea of paying $ 30k in cash all at once that is a strong indication that perhaps the new car is a luxury you are n't in a position to buy at this time borrowing the money and paying for it over time makes it psychologically easier to over spend on transportation

i 've mostly seen this term by those with large portfolios in gold commodities the incentive for these guys who for example may have a large portfolio in gold is to drive demand for gold up which in turn drives the value of the gold they 're holding up and makes their assets more valuable the easiest way to get a large amount of people to invest in gold is to scare them into thinking the whole market is going to fall apart and that gold is their best only option   i personally think that the path we 're on is not particularly sustainable and that we 're heading for a large correction recession anyways but for other reasons   example   peter youtube channel called the economist with conspiracy user videos   actual the economist magazine researching the user videos   edit formatting

pete b mentioned adjusting your payments using the debt snowball method and i agree it is one possible solution another being the debt avalanche method here is a link that describes both   there was a time in my past when i had 17 credit lines open totaling about $ 12,000 if i had paid them the way the banks asked minimum monthly payments it would have taken decades to pay off then i was shown these two techniques and as a result i was able pay them down rapidly and close all but 2 lines within 5 years like others i am going to say that if you already own your house free and clear never never never put a loan on it unless the loan is a to improve the house or b a life death emergency if you get sick or fired and miss even a single payment on a heloc you could lose your house forever and that just plain sucks not only will you then be forced into renting a place money down the drain but your credit rating will take such a huge hit it will be years if ever before you can even try and buy a new home   debts come and go as do the toys and other things we buy with that debt homes are security stability for tomorrow never give that up for a little ease comfort today update i had to go looking for it but here is some software that i used all those years ago to figure out my strategy for paying down all my credit bills it 's a bit clunky but it 's super easy to use plus it has some other variations on snowball and avalanche methods as well i definitely found it helpful

in your comment you said it just seems a little stupid to me to go and put away money for the explicit purpose of emergencies presumably in a way that 's somehow different from how you would normally save money seems better to go and treat the money as you would normally and then pull whatever you need from the money that you had saved the problem with that logic is that people save money for many different things   you might save for a vacation or a new refrigerator or a new car or a house or your kids college education   if you pull whatever you need for such expenses you may find that when a real emergency occurs you do n't have enough money   the things you used it for may have been legitimate reasonable expenses but nonetheless you may later wish you had deferred those expenses until after you had built up a cushion so the idea of an emergency fund is to designate certain money that is not to be used for whatever you need but specifically for unforeseen circumstances   of course there can be debate about what counts as an emergency but the main point is to distinguish saving for planned future expenses from saving for unplanned future expenses note that this does n't mean the money has to be in a separate account or saved in any special way   it just means the money has to be considered by you as an emergency fund   for some people it may be psychologically useful to put the emergency fund in a separate account that they never withdraw from   but even if you just have all your money in one savings account and you mentally tell yourself i do n't want to ever let the balance drop below $ 10,000 just so i have a safety cushion then you are effectively designating that $ 10,000 as an emergency fund

context is key here futures do n't really have to do with a time in the future in this context   futures are a capital market futures market just like stocks are a market stock market both capital markets have the ability to affect each other up until 30 years ago there was a separate use for the futures market but in the days since they are mostly used for stock derivatives financial futures are the most widely traded contracts since 1980 hugely the commodity futures that the market was designed for   so there is overlap and one affect the other i 'm not going to go into too much detail here but basically the futures market trades 24 hours a day 6.5 days of the week and the   stock market trades 8 12 hours a day 5 days a week   so when the stock market closes the futures market is still running will react and effect the broad stock market   hope that gets you started in your research

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

this depends on a lot actually with the overall being your goals and how much you like risk    question what are your fees commissions for selling $ will wipe out some gains on those trades if all are sold with $ commission not including the commission payed when purchased that should be factored into the cost basis also i would recommend doing commission free etfs   you can get the same affect as a mutual fund without the fees associated with paying someone to invest in etfs and stocks on another note your portfolio looks rather risky   although everyone has their own risk preference so this might be yours but if you are thinking about a mutual fund instead of individual stocks you probably are risk averse i would suggest consulting with an adviser on how to set up for the future   financial advice is free flowing from your local barber dentist and of course stackexchange but i would look towards a professional disclaimer these are my thoughts and opinions only feel free to add comments below

i work in analyzing economic development projects in the midwest like this and one of the most frustrating aspects of my job is when people try to distill and simplify complex financing structures for the sake of misleading others and furthering an agenda it 's not uncommon that i see small local blogs write articles saying something to the effect of major development project skips paying the taxes it rightfully owes completely disregarding the fact that in most cases the local government 's options are to either give the developer an incentive and make some additional money or offer nothing and watch the developer walk away from the table for a different site the next county over most governments given the choice would take lowered tax payments and more jobs over no tax payments and no jobs   since i was curious i decided to do a quick back of the envelope calculation of this project using a common economic impact model i used a conservative assumption of 3,000 new jobs the minimum foxconn expects to have by 2020 and well below the maximum capacity of the factory in the audio and video equipment manufacturing code of industry using the entire state of wisconsin as a geography this industry has average annual earnings in wisconsin of $ so i subtracted out $ 3,000 per job to make it in line with the article i also used the liberal assumption that 100 of these jobs will be considered net new or that they wo n't be replacing or destroying any existing jobs within the state    the results    salaries alone will amount to about $ 160 million per year assuming all workers receive the same salary of $ 53,000    indirect effects basically new jobs and spending for other industries used to support and maintain the factory that are n't directly employed by the factory itself will add an additional $ 20 million in earnings annually     finally induced effects the economic impact of new employees spending their salaries within the economy will add an additional $ 80 million    total change in jobs including factory workers maintenance and utility workers and new workers in supply chain industries is estimated as just north of 5,000    this adds up to $ 260 million in additional annual earnings within the wisconsin economy there is a lot more to be considered when looking at a project like this and there are a lot of ways wisconsin or foxconn can fuck this all up but it is n't out of the realm of possibility that attracting this new plant will end up being a worthwhile plan for wisconsin    also this quote   are calling this development he said speaking from the east room of the white house because we believe this will have a transformational effect on wisconsin just as silicon valley transformed the san francisco bay area   sounds like bullshit silicon valley is largely research and development not manufacturing saying that you 'll replicate the success of software engineers earning $ 120k a year by bringing in more $ 50k a year manufacturing jobs is misleading at best

usually their pe ratio will just be listed as 0 or blank   though i 've always wondered why they do n't just list the negative pe as from a straight math standpoint it makes sense pe while it can be a useful barometer for a company but certainly does not tell you everything   a company could have negative earnings for a lot of reasons some good and some bad   the company could just be a bad company and could be losing money hand over fist or the company could have had a one time occurrence such as a big acquisition or some other event that just affected this years earnings or they could be an awesome high growth company that is heavily investing for their future and forgoing locking in profits now for much bigger profits in the future generally ipo company 's fall into that last category as they are going public usually because they want an influx of cash that they are going to use to grow the company much more rapidly   so they are likely already taking all incoming $ $ and taking on debt to grow the company and have exceeded all of those options and that 's when they turn to the stock market for the additional influx of cash so it is very common for these companies not to have earnings    now you just have to decide if that company is investing that money wisely and will in the future translate to actual earnings

a lot of people do this for example in my area nice townhouses go for about $ 400 k so if you have $ 80,000 you can buy one and rent it here are the typical numbers so you would make $ 350 per month or $ per year on $ 80,000 in capital or about 5 profit what can go wrong 1 the property does not rent and sits vacant you must come up with $ 2100 in mortgage payments taxes and insurance every month without fail or default 2 unexpected expenses a new furnaces costs over $ 5,000 a new roof costs $ 7,000 a new appliance costs $ 600 to $ 2000 depending on how upscale your property is i just had a toilet fixed for a leaky it cost me $ 200 as you can see maintenance expenses can quickly get a lot higher than the $ 50 shown above and not only that if you fix things as cheaply as possible as most landlords do not only does that decrease the of the property but it causes stuff to break sooner 3 deadbeats some people will rent your property and then not pay you now you have a property with no income you are spending $ 2100 per month to pay for it and you are facing steep attorney fees to get the deadbeats evicted they can fight you in court for months 4 damage wear and tear whenever a tenant turns over there is always a lot of broken or worn stuff that has to be fixed holes in the wall need to be busted locks broken windows non working toilets stains on the carpet stuck doors ripped screens leaky showers broken tiles painting exterior trim painting walls painting fences etc you can spend thousands every time a tenant changes other caveats banks are much more strict about loaning to non home owners you usually have to have reserve income so if you have little or no income or you are stretched already it will be difficult to get commercial loans for example lets say your take home pay is $ 7,000 and you have no mortgage at all you rent then it is fine the bank will loan you the money but lets say you only have $ 5,000 in take home pay and you have an $ 1,800 mortgage on your own home in that case it is very unlikely a bank will allow you to assume a 2nd mortgage on a rental property the more you try to borrow the more reserve income the bank will require this tends to set a limit on how much you can leverage

this is an old question that has an accepted answer but it has gotten bumped due to an edit and the answers given are incorrect i am assuming this means that every other friday the company is going into the open public market buying those shares and then giving it out to the employees no companies will internally hold shares that it intends to offer employees as additional compensation there are no open market transactions so the market price of the stock does not change at least not due to buying pressure   the only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses these share may come through an initial buyback from the market but more common is that when companies issue new shares they keep some internally for exactly this situation   if they issued new shares every pay period it would dilute the existing shares several times a quarter which would be difficult to account for

if you have the money to pay cash for the car then 0 months will save you the most money there are of course several caveats the money for the car has to be in a relatively liquid form selling stocks which would trigger taxes may make the pay cash option non optimal paying cash for the car should n't leave you car rich but cash poor taking all your savings to pay cash would not be a good idea note paying cash does n't involve taking a full of bills to the dealer you can use a a check if cash is not an option then the longest time period balanced by the rates available is best if the bank says x percent for 12 23 months y percent for 24 47 months z percent for 48 to it may be best to take the 47 month loan because it keeps the middle rate for a long time you want to lock in the lowest rate you can for the longest period they allow the longer period keeps the required minimum monthly payment as low as possible the lower rate saves you on interest remember you generally can pay the loan off sooner by making extra or larger payments leasing never lease unless you are writing off the monthly lease payment as a business expense if the choice is monthly lease payments or depreciation for tax purposes the lease can make the most sense if business taxes are n't involved then leasing only means that you have a complex deal where you finance the most expensive part of the ownership period you have to watch the mileage for several years and you may have to pay a large amount at the end of the period for damages and excess miles plus many times you do n't end up with the car at the end of the lease   in the united states one way to get a good deal if you have to get a loan take the rebate from the dealer and the loan from a bank credit union the interest rate at banking institution is a better range of rates and length plus you get the dealer cash many times the dealer will only give you the 0 interest rate if you pay in 12 months and skip the rebate where the interest paid to the bank will be less than the rebate

loans do not carry an interest balance you can not pay off all the interest the only way to reduce the interest to zero is to pay off the loan otherwise the interest due each month is some percentage of the outstanding principal think of it from the bank 's perspective they 've invested some amount of money in you and they expect a return on that investment in the form of interest if you somehow paid in 16 years all the interest the bank expected to receive in 30 years you 've been scammed

it possibly could have made sense historically when interest rates were higher in the uk you used to get negligible if any interest on a current checking account but could get modest interest from a savings account so transferring the bulk of your salary to a savings account and paying from there or transferring back to the current account when needed could make some sense but even then was probably not worth the effort nowadays at least in the uk most easy access savings accounts pay very little interest but there are current accounts example list here from comparison site that pay more interest provided you go through several hoops typically you have to pay your salary or a minimum number of £ per month into the account and have a minimum number of direct debits going out some have fees some only last for a year

there 's two scenarios the loan accrues interest on the remaining balance or the total interest was computed ahead of time and your payments were averaged over x years so your payments are always the same the second scenarios is better for the bank so guess what you probably have in the first scenario i would pay it off to avoid paying interest unless there is a compelling reason to keep the cash available for something else and you do n't mind paying interest in the second case you 're going to pay interest over x years as computed when you bought the car no matter how quickly you pay it off so take your time if you pay it earlier it 's like paying interest that would not have actually accrued since you 're paying it off faster than necessary if you pay it off i 'm not sure if it would close the account your credit history might show the account as being paid which is a good thing

this advice will be too specific but with the non retirement funds start by paying off the car loan if it 's more than ~3 interest rate the remainder looks like a good emergency fund if you do n't have one of those yet you do now store it in the best interest bearing savings account you can find probably accessible by online banking if you wish to grow your emergency fund beyond $ 14 20,000 you might also consider some bonds to boost your returns and add a little risk but not nearly as much risk as stocks with the roth ira first of all toss the precious metals precious metals are a crisis hedge and an advanced speculative instrument not a beginner 's investment strategy for 40 of the portfolio you 're either going to use this money for retirement or your down payment fund if it 's retirement you 're 28 even with a kid on the way you can afford to take risks in the retirement portfolio put it in either a date fund or a series of index funds with an asset allocation suggested by an asset allocation suggestion calculator you should probably have north of 80 stocks if it 's money for retirement if you 're starting a down payment fund or want to save for something similar or if you want to treat the ira money like it 's a down payment fund either use one of these vanguard funds or something that 's structured to do the same sort of thing i 'm throwing vanguard links at you because they have the funds with the low expense ratios you can use vanguard at your discretion if it 's all an ira and not a 401(k feel free to use an alternative but watch the expense ratios lest they consume up to half your returns

that 's just it though they are splitting up the 1 and in most cases especially vanguard they are splitting up far less   etfs do n't have 12b-1 fees explaining why you 're experiencing different returns for etfs will almost certainly involve something other than their expense again this is especially true for vanguard they have the cheapest etfs around though i think schwab beats them on a few now   i can only guess at the full compensation structure betterment likely earns money on cash reserves and   securities i guess they also charge a small fee from what i understand finance is very slim these days   i guess i 'm wondering what your ultimate question is if it 's the inter corporate compensation structure above is my best guess if it 's about performance then we need to compare the etfs you are looking at if it 's about the fees on funds i think we covered that   as an advisor it 's my experience that very specific inquiries about fees have a deeper concern people hear a lot about being overcharged so cost is a very standard place for clients to initially look when trying to compare performance of portfolios or securities

if you 're refinancing a conforming fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage do n't go with an fha try a harp refinance which wo n't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value harp also limits the risk based pricing adjustments that can be charged so your rate should be very competitive with an fha mortgage even once you get the loan to value ratio down to 80 percent you still have mortgage insurance for several years plus the upfront costs in your case i think it 's a bad deal

during the day market and limit orders are submitted at any time by market participants and there is a bid and an ask that move around over time   trades occur whenever a market order is submitted or a limit order is submitted that at a price that matches or exceeds an existing limit order   if you submit a market order it may consume all best price limit orders and you can get multiple prices changing the bid or ask at the same time   all that stuff happens during the trading day only what happens at the end of the day is different   a bunch of orders that were submitted during the day but marked as on close are aggregated with any outstanding limit orders to create a single closing price according to the algorithm established by the exchange   each exchange may handle the details of this closing event differently   for example the nasdaq 's closing cross or the nyse 's closing auction the close is the most liquid time of the day so investors who are trading large amounts and not interested in intraday swings will often submit a market on close or limit on close order   this minimizes their chance of affecting the price or crossing a big spread   it 's actually most relevant for smaller stocks which may have too little volume during the day to make big trades but have plenty at the close   in short the volume you see is due to these on close orders the spike in volume most likely has no special information about what will happen overnight or the next day   it 's probably just a normal part of the market for illiquid stocks

i can not speak for paypal specifically and i doubt anyone who does n't actually work on their internal automated payment systems could however i can speak from experiencing in working on automated forex transaction systems and tell you what many institutions do and it is often not based on live rates there is no law stating an institution must honor a specific market exchange rate institutions can determine their own rates how and when they want to however there is some useful information on their website the most readily available information on currency exchange rates is based on interbank exchange rates interbank exchange rates are established in the course of currency trading among a global network of over 1,000 banks and are not available through consumer or retail channels this leads me to believe they pull exchange rates from either oanda or xe periodically and then use these rates throughout the day to conduct business paypal does not disclose who they use to determine rates and it 's highly doubtful they do this for every transaction using live rates even if they did there would be no way for you to check and be certain of a particular exchange rate as paypal states consumers may use these rates as a reference but should not expect to use interbank rates in transactions that involve currency conversion to obtain actual retail rates contact your local financial institution or currency exchange or check the rate displayed in your paypal transaction this is partly because rates can change by the second just like stock prices or anything else which is susceptible to the open market 's variables of supply demand news events etc so even if you check the rates on oanda which you can do here you are not going to get a 100 accurate representation of what you would get by doing an exchange immediately afterwards from paypal or any other financial institution however if you want to estimate using oanda 's currency converter will likely get you close in most scenarios that is assuming paypal does n't charge a premium for the exchange which they may that is also assuming they use live rates it 's also possible they only update their rates based on market rates periodically and not for every transaction you may want to test this by checking the exchange rate on your transaction and comparing that to the oanda rates at the same time

first of all one thing that is very important match is always better than no match   so you should definitely use that match on your hsa if you 've already maxed out the company match on your 401(k   in fact for most people there wo n't be much reason to invest in your 401(k above the company match at all if for example your company matches only up to 5 and you want to invest 15 of income into retirement you ought to open an ira instead roth or standard depending on your situation and put the extra 10 in there beyond that you 're right hsa 's the accounts themselves have all the benefits of a 401(k   i would n't invest there for retirement instead an ira though   there is just no reason the only built in downside of an hsa is the hdhp attachment which may be undesirable to some employees or in certain situations if you want to get down to raw dollar figures and your company is offering both a standard health plan and a the calculation will be dependent on the premiums and benefits of each and your projected costs of your health care which is always a crystal ball estimation anyway   those costs and benefits can vary wildly from a completely obvious choice on either the hdhp or standard plan or pretty much a wash where you decide based on your comfort level with a high deductible to illustrate standard plan your company might offer a standard plan that costs you $ 100 out of pocket for an individual   that means you pay a minimum of $ 1200 a year for health care   most plans will have copays a flat amount like $ 15 you pay for standard doctor consultations a deductible you pay 100 of fees up to this co pays do n't count a percentage you pay beyond the deductible 20 is typical and a maximum like $ 1000 per individual per year beyond this up to a lifetime maximum benefit of like $ 2 million you wo n't be charged anything in a standard plan where you have no expenses you might pay $ 1200 a year plus a couple co pays for a total of $   in a bad year with surgery you might max out so $ 1200 + $ 30 + $ 1000 = $ hdhp hsa these plans are very different   you might still pay a premium i.e. $ 30 a month   they will still have a deductible and maximum but they might be the same amount   you will probably not have copays i did n't when i had one but i could be wrong which means a standard doctor visit will cost more like $ 80 100 in a good year this will mean that you pocket $ 500 from your company but pay back $ 360 in premiums   a couple doctor visits would mean there 's only $ 300 left in your account at the end of the year   but that 's still a net cost of only $ 60 compared to $   big win in a bad year you would end up out of pocket the max say $ 2000 plus premiums minus the $ 500 for a total of $ 1860   in this case still better than the standard plan the important difference will come in an in between year   you will reach the max quicker on an hdhp than you will on a standard plan   with a family where all of these numbers are higher and you have more people to be getting sick injured this might make the standard plan a better benefit however since whatever you build up in an hsa account stays with you forever while you 're single and have only your own health to be concerned about that is probably a good choice   when you have a family things might change and you switch to a standard plan but you still have that war chest to offset copays and hospital visits in future years i was forced onto an hsa for 2 years with a smaller company   they had a really good contribution $ 2500 if i remember right and we saved up big time later when my wife was pregnant we were on a low deductible standard plan and paid all our fees out of the hsa   it worked out great i say as long as the averaged yearly expected costs make sense after doing calculations illustrated above go for it

first do you understand why it dropped was it overvalued before or is this an overreaction to some piece of news about them or about their industry or arguably if you ca n't answer that you are n't paying enough attention to have been betting on that individual stock assuming you do understand why this price swing occurred or if you 're convinced you know better than the folks who sold at that price do you believe the stock will recover a significant part of its value any time soon or at least show a nice rate of growth from where it is now if so you might want to hold onto it risking further losses against the chance of recovering part or all of what is at this moment only a loss on paper basically if having just seen it drop you 'd still consider buying it at the new price you should buy it from yourself and go on from here that way at least you are n't doing exactly what you hope to avoid buying high and selling low heck if you really believe in the stock you could see this as a buying opportunity on the other hand if you do not believe you would buy it now at its new price and if you see an alternative which will grow more rapidly you should take your losses and move your money to that other stock or split the difference if you are n't sure which is better but can figure out approximately how unsure you are the question is how you move on from here more than how you got here what happened happened what do you think will happen next and how much are you willing to bet on it on the hand this is part of how the market operates risk and potential reward tend to be pretty closely tied to each other you can reduce risk by diversifying across multiple investments so no one company sector market can hurt you too badly and almost anyone sane will tell you that you should diversify but that means giving up some of the chance for big winnings too you probably want to be cautious with most of your money and go for the longer odds only with a small portion that you can afford to lose on if this is really stressing you out you may not want to play with individual stocks mutual funds have some volatility too but they 're inherently diversified to a greater or lesser extent they will rarely delight you but they wo n't usually slap you this way either

is it standard for a bank to need the cheque to cancel it what about if it was intercepted surely you can cancel before you 're generally it makes life easy for the bank they can physically see the cheque and are assured that it has not been cashed   bank can put a hold stop on the cheque however given today 's banking it is complex with multiple systems and specially with international clearing taking months the cheque could have been cashed and the bank that issued may only get to know about it month later is there any way to bypass this best is for your friend to correspond in writing the rejection email from your bank should also go into the communication and follow ups every 15 days all in writing generally after tons of follow up banks would pay it off

that would be great i 'm just skeptical that it 's possible to make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels i guess you could do this by subsidizing research on green energy which is not a bad idea   gt;if you make conventional energy artificially expensive to nudge people towards renewables then you open the door to politicians gaining power by promising to reduce energy costs to the consumer via removing those taxes you 're advocating for   this is actually a great criticism but i do n't see any better solution unless we are going to create an alternative to state capitalism

as a recent college grad who switched to his own car insurance many of the things i did myself are reflected here the 1 thing i did was find out what coverages i had what coverages some friends of mine had car enthusiasts mostly they 're the most informed on this stuff and then figured out what kind of coverages i wanted from there i went around getting quotes from anyone and everyone and eventually built out a sizeable spreadsheet that made it obvious which company was going to offer me the best rate at a given coverage level something else to remember not all insurance companies look at past accidents and violations speeding etc the same in my search i found some have a 3-year scope on accidents and violations while others were as much as 5 years so if your driving record is n't a shining example mine is n't perfect you could potentially save money by considering insurance through a company that will see fewer violations incidents than another because of the size of their scope i ended up saving $ by choosing a company that had a 3-year scope which was on the cusp of when my last violation incident occurred insurance companies will also give out discounts for younger drivers based on gpa average if you have kids and they maintain a high gpa you might be able to get a discount there not all companies offer it so if they do it 's worth finding out how much it is

before the prevalence of electronic trading trading stocks was very costly dropping from in the late 1970s to less than a nickel per share today   exchange fees for liquidity takers are per share currently when orders were negotiated exclusively by humans stocks used to be quoted in fractions rather than decimal such as $ 50 1/2 instead of something more precise like $ that necessary ease of negotiation for humans to rapidly trade extended to trade size as well   traders preferred to handle orders in round lots 100 shares for ease of calculation of the total cost of the trade so 100 shares at $ 50 1/2 would have a total cost of $   the time for a human to calculate an odd lot of 72 shares at $ would take much longer so would cost more per share and these costs were passed on to the client these issues have been negated by electronic trading and simply no longer exist except for obsolete brokerages   there are cost advantages for extremely large trades well above 100 shares per trade brokerage fees today run the they can be as insignificant as what interactive brokers charges to as high as a full service broker that could charge hundreds of usd for a few thousand usd trade   with full service brokerages the charges are frequently and quoted at the time a trade is requested   with discount brokerages there is usually a fee per trade and a fee per share or contract   interactive brokers will charge a fee per share or option only and will even refund parts of the liquidity rebates exchanges provide as close as possible to having a seat on an exchange   even if a trader does not meet interactive brokers minimum trading requirement the monthly fee is so low that it is possible that a buy and hold investor could benefit from the de minimis trade fees it should be noted that liquidity providing hidden orders are typically not but are at least discounted the core costs of all trades are the exchange fees which are per share or contract   over the long run costs charged by brokers will be in excess of charges by exchanges and interactive brokers fee schedule shows that it can be reduced to a simple markup over exchange fees    exchanges sometimes have a fee schedule with lower charges for larger trades but these are out of reach of the average individual

to some extent i suppose most people are okay with paying some taxes but as they teach in intro to economics decisions are made on the margin few are honestly expecting to get away with paying no taxes at all they are instead concerned about how much they spend on taxes and how effectively the classic defense of taxes says roads and national defense and education and fire safety are all important this is not really the problem that people have with taxes people have problems with gigantic ongoing infrastructure that cost many times what they were projected to cost a la boston 's big dig while the city streets are n't properly paved people do n't have big problems with a city run garbage service they have problems with the who get six figure salaries plus a guaranteed union protected job for life and a defined benefit pension plan which they do n't contribute a penny to and likewise for their health plans people do n't have a big problem with paying for schools they have a big problem with paying more than twice the national average for schools and still ending up with miserable schools new jersey people have a problem when the government issues bonds invests the money in the stock market for the public employee pension plan projects a 10 annual return contractually guarantees it to the employees and then puts the taxpayers on the hook when the dow ends up at 11,000 instead of california and people have a problem with the attitude that when they do n't pay taxes they 're basically stealing that money or that tax cuts are morally equivalent to a handout and the that they 're terrible people for trying to keep some of their money from the government

shorting stocks borrowing the shares to sell now then buying them back when the price drops   risk if you are wrong the stock can go up and if there are a lot of people shorting the stock you can get stuck in a short squeeze   that means that so many people need to buy the stock to return the ones they borrowed that the price goes up even further and faster   also whoever you borrowed the stock from will often make the decision to sell for you put options risk put values do n't always drop when the underlying price of the stock drops this is because when the stock drops volatility goes up and volatility can raise the value of an option and you need to check each stock for whether or not these options are available lists whether a stock is optional or not and for shorting you also need to find a broker that owns shares that they are willing to lend out

i ca n't speak for canada but in the us banks and other financial industry firms will lobby the sec to some extent over proposed regulations basically any time the sec proposes a regulation they have a period where anyone including financial firms can comment on it via letters the purpose here is for the regulators to get different perspectives on the regulation to help them shape rules that go far enough to protect investors but do n't go so far as to over burden or harm the industries they 're regulating    now obviously this can be a problem largely because financial firms of course are always going to be opposed to new extensive regulations but also because more often than not few investors members of the public actually comment so the sec gets a lot more comments from the industry the sec frequently treats the volume of comments almost like votes so in return the massive volume of industry comments tends to shape their proposed regulations towards being more industry friendly you can see this in action as a huge majority of revisions to proposed regulation is use to water down the proposed rules    all in all industry members lobbying and working with their regulators is n't inherently bad after all these are the people firms that know the industry best and so their feedback is valuable and can truly help regulators to make more efficient and effective rules but it certainly can be excessive and will undoubtedly cause bad optics

it may depend on the rental agreement you signed some agreements may include clauses that allow for early termination so check your agreement carefully where there is an early termination clause included it will usually have some sort of notice period or financial penalty associated with it   for example you may have to give a couple of months notice and pay rent up to the end of that period or be able to pay some sort of one off penalty as a more practical example i broke a us rental agreement early last autumn and had two early termination options in my rental agreement in my case we chose the second option since we were actually moving out of the country and it was easier to have our us finances completely settled i 'm now planning on breaking another agreement because i 'm in the process of purchasing a property and the purchase will likely go through before the lease expires   in this case the early termination clause requires 2 months notice i.e. we will have to give 2 months notice and pay rent for those two months unless we are less than 2 months from the end of the lease as points out you should also check the laws for the jurisdiction your rental agreement is in to understand what your rights and options are if your agreement does not have an early termination clause

i would not advise any stock picking or other active management even using mutual funds that are actively managed   there is a large body of knowledge that needs learning before you even attempt that stay passive with index funds either etfs or even better low cost passive mutual funds because these prevent you from buying selling but i have not problem saying you can invest 100 in equity as long as your stomach can handle the price swings   if you out after a 25 drop that does not recover within a year so you sell at the market bottom then you are better off staying with a lot less risk   it is personal there are a lot of valid reasons for young people to accept more risk and equally valid reason why not   see list at

at one point it was illegal to melt silver coins in the us but it is legal now   i do n't know that will happen with copper coins but that 's what happened with silver coins accumulating nickels and leaving them as is in their spendable state is legal   it 's also a way to take physical ownership of copper i expect to see more sales of nickels based on weight   people are already selling high copper content cents on ebay by weight   there are machines in production that sort the zinc ones from the copper ones   's law has small business backing copper cents are already worth twice their face value in the copper content   nickels will get up there too they are awfully heavy and bulky relative to their value though   precious metals give you better bang for your ounce

i 'm looking at this because i 'm just wondering what they base their criteria on   how are they splitting their operations to have multiple headquarters especially when both are in the same country it would make more sense if it was in another country although i 'm not sure how they manage their operations maybe they need a move like this etc is one more focused on global operations while the other is on local their hq is on the west coast so would they build a second hq that 's that close to their main base or move it to the east coast to spread it out i 'm just wondering why and what the reasoning is behind a move like this   the impact a move like this makes on the surrounding area is large considering the local economics and jobs etc which was outlined in the post   how will it effect traffic flows including if freight is involved now population concentration commutes etc there 's a lot of stuff to consider talent pools development of the area   i 'm not saying it should or should n't be but just because i have an idea of the surroundings my guess matching their criteria would be va its on the edge of the metro system connected to the major concentrated near engineering and computer science jobs etc off ways to the side to allow easier commutes instead of directly traffic into a city like dc and also near the airport    there are probably similar places all around if you look for it

my understanding is that to make the $ 18,000 elective deferral in this case you need to pay yourself at least $ 18,000   there will be some tax on that for social security and medicare so you 'll actually need to pay yourself a bit more to cover that too the employer contribution is limited to 25 of your total compensation   the $ 18,000 above counts but if you want to max out on the employer side you 'll need to pay yourself $ 140,000 salary since 25 of $ 140,000 is the $ 35,000 that you want to put into the 401k from the employer side there are some examples from the irs here that may help i know that you 're not a one participant plan but some of the examples may help anyway since they are not all specific to one participant plans

that 's right it is the far right that have fought medicare and single payer health insurance from the 70s    ronald reagan famously recorded a lp medicare as the slippery slope to socialism   health insurance is a tool large corporations use to 1 keep employees of losing their job and 2 discouraging employees from leaving their organization and starting a small business that will compete with them   it is anything but a poorly thought out policy if large corporations felt it was bad for business they would join the fight for single payer which would relieve them of one hell of an expense   they could save billions but they do n't because they want it this way it must be worth a lot of money to them

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

it looks like it has to deal with an expiration of rights as a taxable event i found this link via google which states that   not only does the psec shareholder have a taxable event but he has    two taxable events the net effect of these two taxable events has    different consequences for different shareholders depending upon their    peculiar tax situations the correct statement of the tax treatment of unexercised rights    is in the on page 32 which reads in relevant part as follows if you receive a subscription right from psec and do not sell or    exercise that right before it expires you should generally expect to    have 1 taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value if    any of the subscription right on the date of its distribution by psec    to the extent of psec ’s current and accumulated earnings and profits    and 2 a capital loss upon the expiration of such right in an amount    equal to your adjusted tax basis if any in such right which should    generally equal the fair market value if any of the subscription    right on the date of its distribution by psec please note for quarterly estimated taxes purposes that the    dividend taxable events occur on the date of its distribution by psec    my emphasis while the capital loss occurs upon expiration of such    right my emphasis they do not occur on 31 december 2015 or some    other date however to my knowledge neither of the taxable events he mentions would be taxed by 4/15 if you are worried about it i would recommend seeing a tax professional otherwise i 'd wait to see the tax forms sent by your brokerage

mortgage is a secured debt a combination of a promissory note and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property yes you are in debt but that depends upon whether you define the term in debt as a debt appearing on the balance sheet or the net of assets liabilities is less than zero whether you have a debt expense on the income statement budget or whether the net of income expenses is less than zero one person might look at their budget find the monthly mortgage payment listed and judge that they have a debt payment and thus are in debt or they might look at their expenses find they exceed their income and judge that they are in debt another person might look at their balance sheet compare assets to liabilities and only say they were in debt when their liabilities exceeded their assets some people view mortgage debt as good debt as they view certain debts as good and others as bad trust me having a high mortgage payment higher 30 of your net income is hard and over 40 is bad consider you balance sheet and your income statement   on your balance sheet the house appears on the asset side with an estimated value while the mortgage really the promissory note part of the mortgage appears on the liability side on your income statement your house does not appear on the income side but the mortgage promissory note payment appears on the expense side so you clearly have both a liability with a clearly defined value and an expense with a clearly defined payment but do you have an asset according to an accountant you have an asset and a liability but you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue income nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income when we think about an asset does the word have the connotation of some thing with value something that produces income   well by that measure a house only provides income when we rent it out and only has value when we consider selling it as millions of families discovered during the housing price collapse when the market price of your asset falls substantially your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be broke

the us treasury is not directly involved but can affect the junk bond market by issuing new bonds when rates rise since us bonds are considered completely safe changes in yield will affect low quality debt for example if rates rose to levels like 1980 a 12 treasury bond would drive the prices of junk bonds issued today dramatically lower another price factor is likelihood of default companies with junk credit ratings have lousy balance sheets so negative economic conditions or tight short term debt markets can result in default for many of these companies whether bonds in a fund are new issues or purchased on the secondary market is n't something that is very relevant to the individual investor the current interest rate environment is factored into the market already via prices of bonds

to many question and they are all treated differently i was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets such as mortgages bonds stocks    what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second when the company decides to pay dividends does it literally track    down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in    that person 's bank account this sounds absolutely absurd and seems    like it would be a logistical nightmare in stocks the dividends are issued periodically the dividend date is declared well in advance as on end of the day on dividend date the list of individuals or entities who own the stock is available with the stock exchange registrar of the companies to this list the dividends are credited in next few days weeks via banking channel most of this is automated what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second on bonds things work slightly differently an bond is initially issued for say 95 discount of 5 and payment of 100 after say 5 years so when the person sells it after an year he would logically look to get a price of 96 of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of or so every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest the person who submits in on maturity gets 100   for the homeowner i 'm assuming he she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from even if the bank no longer owns the mortgage in this case does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment this depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor if this was collateral as mortgage backed security it is a very different story

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns if you want something that does n't require any work on your end consider having a fee only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in september in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like russia in the 1990s real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there are n't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area there may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a rental    house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold   what investment of your own time do you plan on making here both in terms of understanding what your long term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan if you put the money in the bank are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using are there any better investments you may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there is n't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

you do n't need to have a bunch of credit cards lying around just a couple is fine get a rewards card without annual fee that pays you back for use and use it regularly to buy groceries for example pay it off promptly each month using the rewards if you like to reduce the amount you have to send in or you can use the rewards for other purchases some merchants offer $ 25 worth of merchandise for $ 20 in rewards it used to be the case that you could negotiate a discount for paying cash rather than use a credit card but that is a lot harder to do now in many cases because credit card company contracts with merchants prohibit this practice also merchants often prefer credit cards rather than cash because money handling is an issue pay for an armored car to come pick up the day 's receipts or risk getting mugged on the way to the bank possible if you leave the money overnight in the store daily balancing of cash register etc so not being in debt and being rich enough to not need to be in debt are goals and you have my best wishes that you will reach them soon but getting rid of all your credit cards as a part of not being in debt may be more trouble than it is worth keep a couple pay them off promptly and if you are concerned about being in debt you can time your charges so that you are in debt at   most 2 or 3 days each month

this is not a direct answer to your question but you might want to consider whether you want to have a financial planner at all would a large mutual fund company or brokerage serve your needs better than a bank you are still quite young and so have been contributing to iras for only a few years also the wording in your question suggests that your ira investments have not done spectacularly well and so it is reasonable to infer that your ira is not a large amount or at least not as large as what it would be 30   years from now at this level of investment it would be difficult for you to find a financial planner who spends all that much time looking after your interests that you should get away from your current planner presumably a mid level employee in what is typically called the trust division of the bank is a given   but to go to another bank or even to a different employee in the same bank where   you will also likely be towards investing your ira in cds annuities and a few mutual funds with substantial sales charges and   substantial annual expense fees might just take you from the pan into the fire you might want to consider transferring your ira to a large mutual fund company and investing it in something simple   like one of their low cost meaning small annual expense ratio index funds the couch potato portfolio suggests equal amounts invested in a no load s&p 500 index fund and a no load bond index fund or a split favoring the stock index fund in view of your age and the fact that the ira should be a long term investment   but the point is   you can open an ira account have the money transferred from your ira account with the bank and make the investments on line all by yourself instead of having a financial advisor do it on your behalf and charge you a fee for doing so not to mention possibly screwing it up you can set up automated investment too the mutual fund company will gladly withdraw money from your checking account and invest it in whatever fund(s you choose   all this is not complicated at all   if you would like to follow the couch potato strategy and rebalance your portfolio once a year you can do it   by yourself too if you want to invest in funds other than the s&p 500 index fund etc most mutual fund   companies offer a portfolio analysis and advice for a fee and the fee is usually waived when the assets increase above certain levels varies from company to company   you could thus have a portfolio analysis done each year and hopefully it will be free after a few more years   indeed at that level you also typically get one person assigned as your advisor just as you have with a bank once you get the recommendations you can choose to follow them   or not but you have control over how and where your ira assets are invested   over the years as your ira assets grow you can branch out into   investments other than index funds but right now having a financial planner for your ira might not be worth it later when you have more assets by all means if you want to explore investing in specific stocks with a brokerage instead of sticking to mutual funds only but this might also mean phone calls urging you to sell stock a right now or buy hot stock b today etc so one way of improving your interactions and have a better experience with your new financial planner is to not have a planner at all for a few years and do some of the work yourself

in a word no diversification is the first rule of investing   your plan has poor diversification because it ignores most of the economy large cap stocks   this means for the expected return your portfolio would get you would bear an unnecessarily large amount of risk   large cap and small cap stocks take turns outperforming each other   if you hold both you have a safer portfolio because one will perform well while the other performs poorly   you will also likely want some exposure to the bond market a simple and diversified portfolio would be a total market index fund and a total bond market fund   something like 60 in the equity and 40 in the bonds would be reasonable   you may also want international exposure and maybe exposure to real estate via a reit fund you have expressed some risk aversion in your post   the way to handle that is to take some of your money and keep it in your cash account and the rest into the diversified portfolio remember when people add more and more asset classes large cap international bonds etc they are not increasing the risk of their portfolio they are reducing it via diversification   the way to reduce it even more after you have diversified is to keep a larger proportion of it in a savings account or other guaranteed investment btw your p2p lender investment seems like a great idea to me but 60 of your money in it sounds like a lot

the fee structures are different for pin based transactions versus credit style transactions usually there is a fixed fee around $ 0.50 for pin based transactions and a varying fixed fee plus a percentage for credit transactions something like $ 0.35 + 2.5 there are also value limits for pin based transactions i believe that you can not exceed $ 400 in most places the signature feature of credit transactions is n't there to protect you it signifies your agreement to comply with the contract you and the credit card issuer protecting the merchant from some types of chargeback some merchants waive the signature for low dollar value transactions to increase convenience and speed up the lines all of your other questions are answered elsewhere on this site

according to this q&a by a houston law professor the law however is not designed to interfere with an individual 's right to stop payment on a valid check because of a dispute with someone if he did n't deliver as promised you do not owe the money and have the right to stop payment assuming that you had enough money in the bank to cover the check stopping payment is not a crime i found several other pages essentially saying the same thing   all the usual disclaimers apply i am not a lawyer this is not legal advice etc   in particular laws might vary by state basically though it does n't seem there 's any reason why you ca n't stop payment on the check just because you feel like it   if you then provide a cashier 's check for the payment your ex partner will not really have anything to complain about   if you 're worried about annoying him by doing this that 's a separate issue but given the situation you describe i do n't see why you should be   if you feel he is being a pain in the neck feel free to be a pain in the neck right back and force him to accept the payment in the manner you decide instead of allowing him to string you along note two things obviously if you have reason to believe the guy will sue you you should act with caution   also i 'm not suggesting withdrawing payment completely only stopping the check and issuing a new payment that you do n't have to wait on e.g. cashier 's check

from indian context there are a number of factors that are influencing the economic condition and the exchange rate interest rate etc are reflection of the situation i shall try and answer the question through the above indian example india is running a budget deficit of 4 odd for last 6 7 years which means that is spending more than their revenue collection this money is not in the system so the govt has to print the money either the direct 4 or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4 do n't confuse this with us printing post 2008 after printing the supply of inr is more compared to usd in the market inr is current a c convertible value of inr usd falls in simplistic terms there is another impact of this printing it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise to contain this price rise reserve bank of india rbi increases the interest rates and increases compulsory reserve ratio thus trying to pull lock up money so that overall money supply decreases but there is a limit to which rbi can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest the above in simplistic term how this is working however there are many factors in economy and the above should be treated as it is intended to a simplistic view only

you ca n't ask insurers to use a particular score they have a state approved underwriting model that they must follow consistently insurance companies make money by not paying claims and poor credit score including limit access to credit increases the probability that you will file a small claim why if you get into a minor accident say $ 750 of damage and have a $ 500 deductible you are much less likely to file a claim to get $ 250 if you have access to a cash or credit lines to make the repairs yourself   if you feel that you are going to be penalized for closing credit card accounts the solution is simple do n't close them other than an event where you need to sever a relationship with a co owner of an account ie you break up with your significant other dissolve a business etc or avoid paying an annual fee there is no advantage to you closing a revolving credit account ever if you can not control your spending throw the card in the eventually the credit card company will close your account for inactivity which affects your credit to a lesser degree the big exception is if you carry sufficient balances on other cards your credit utilization ratio goes up materially

if you have a minimum monthly payment amount of $ 190 then you have to make a payment every month if you pay only every 3 months even if you pay 3 times the minimum amount or much more you would not be making the minimum monthly payment for each month one month would get the minimum monthly payment plus a lot more then the following 2 months you would be in default because you did n't pay the minimum amount for that month interest is usually accrued daily so you want to make the payments as early as possible pay back as much as you can afford each month as soon as the money comes in when computing how much you can afford if you have n't already done so it may be a good idea to keep a little bit aside at least the first few months to build up a little security pillow just in case you need it you wo n't be able to get money back from those overpayments if you need any money for an emergency

it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

there 's no need for an index to have a currency as its purpose is not to act as an asset but rather to signal investors about the performance of a collection of stocks an index can be price weighted meaning that its value equals the arithmetic average of the prices of each stock in the index with no stock splits the return on this index is the same as the return on a portfolio composed of one share of each stock if there is a stock split however instead of dividing by the number of stocks as you normally would when taking the arithmetic average you divide it by the number that will make the value of the index pre stock split arithmetic average equal to the value post stock split then use that dividing number for all periods until a new stock split occurs   an index can be value weighted meaning that its changes in value track the percentage changes in total market capitalization of the stocks in the index price weighted indexes ignore for firm size and percentage changes in price weighted indexes are not robust to stock splits value weighted indexes take firm size into account and are robust to stock splits djia is price weighted s&p 500 is value weighted

you are n't playing devils advocate you are n't thinking at all   if it 's skilled or not is not is n't relevant to the discussion at all   walmart makes more than enough money to pay their employees a living wage    the fact is that every single walmart exists today their employees can be subsidized by the state and federal government which means your tax dollars that you work for every single day literally is being used to pad the profit margins of walmart executives and their shareholders   do you understand that   your tax dollars are paying for the benefits of walmarts workers walmart is not paying the benefits of their employees out of the profit they make     what 's the argument here that because it 's unskilled labor these people do n't deserve to be paid enough to not be on state aid   is that really the argument here   if unskilled labor is so worthless how is walmart generating some of the largest profits of any company around when most of their work force is unskilled labor

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

i wrote a spreadsheet < < it may not be obvious this is a link to pull down the spreadsheet a while back that might help you you can start by putting your current salary next to your age adjust the percent of income saved 14 for you and put in the current total   the sheet basically shows that if one saves 15 from day one of working and averages an 8 return they are on track to save over 20x their final income and at the 4 withdrawal rate will replace 80 of their income remember if they save 15 and at retirement the 7.65 fica goes away so it 's 100 of what they had anyway for what it 's worth a 10 average return drops what you need to save down to 9 i say to a young person try to start at 15 better that when you 're 40 you realize you 're well ahead of schedule and can relax a bit than to assume that 8 9 is enough to save and find you need a large increase to catch up   to answer specifically here there are those who concluded that 4 is a safe withdrawal rate so by targeting 20x your final income as retirement savings you 'll be able to retire well   retirement spending needs are not the same for everyone when i cite an 80 replacement rate it 's a guess a rule of thumb that many point out is flawed the real number is your true spending need which of course can be far higher or lower the younger investor is going to have a far tougher time guessing this number than someone a decade away from retiring the 80 is just a target to get started it should shift to the real number in your 40s or 50s as that number becomes clear   next i see my original answer did n't address social security benefits the benefit is n't linear a lower wage earner can see a benefit of as much as 50 of what they earned each year while a very high earner would see far less as the benefit has a maximum a $ 90k earner will see 30 or less the social security site does a great job of giving you your projected benefit and you can adjust target savings accordingly   2016 update the prior 20 years returned cagr considering there were 2 crashes one of which was called a mini depression is pretty remarkable for what it 's worth my adult investing life started in 1984 and i 've seen a cagr of for forecasting purposes i think 8 long term is a conservative number   to answer member comment the 10 years from 2006 2015 had a cagr of time has a way of averaging that lost decade the 00 's to a more reasonable number

much of what you 're asking will not be disclosed for obvious security reasons so do n't be surprised when call center people say they do n't know   they may actually not know but even if they did they 'd be fired if they were to say anything   nothing could be a subject than online security for the financial institutions i do n't know of reliable sources for the data you 're asking about and i do n't know the banks or other firms would release it   for a bank to talk about its incidence rates of fraud would be unusual because none of these institutions wants to appear less safe than their competitors   if there 's any information out there then it 's going to be pretty vague   none of these institutions wants the bad guys to know what their degree of success is against one bank versus any other   i hope that makes sense the smaller banks usually piggyback their data on the networks of the larger financial institutions so they are as secure as a general rule as the larger banks networks they 're running on   also your transactions on your credit cards are not generally handled directly by your bank anyway unless it 's one of the big like chase or bank of america   all transactions run through merchant processors who act as intermediaries between merchants and the banks and those guys are pretty damned good at security   i 've met some of the programmers and they 're impressive to me i 've been a programmer for 35 years and ca n't put a finger on these guys most banks require that you must provide proof of identity when opening an account and that id must me the standards of the usa real id act   here 's an excerpt from the department of homeland security website on what real id is passed by congress in 2005 the real id act enacted the 9/11 commission ’s recommendation that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification such as driver 's licenses the act established minimum security standards for state issued driver ’s licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies from accepting for official purposes licenses and identification cards from states that do not meet these standards states have made considerable progress in meeting this key recommendation of the 9/11 commission and every state has a more secure driver ’s license today than before the passage of the act in order for banks to qualify for fdic protection they must comply with the real id standards when opening accounts as with any business especially online the most effective way to minimize fraud is vigilant monitoring of data   banks and other online financial entities have become very adept at pattern analysis and simply knowing where and what to look for when dealing with their customers   there are certainly sophisticated measures which are kept carefully out of the public eye for doing this and obviously they 're good at it   they have to be right there 's no way to completely eliminate fraud too much incentive exists for the bad guys to not constantly search for new ways to run their schemes and the good guys will always be at the disadvantage because there 's no way to anticipate everything anyone might come up with   just look at online and malware   your antivirus software can only deal with what it knows about and the bad guys are always coming up with some new variant that gets past the filters until the antivirus maker learns of it and comes up with a way to deal with it your question 's a good one to ponder and i would n't want to be the chief of internet security for a bank or online institution because i 'd lay awake at night pondering when the call 's going to come that we finally ran out of luck grin i hope this was helpful good luck

what keshlam said is correct in bookkeeping terms what you are doing is transferring value from some kind of cash account which may in turn be backed by a loan to an asset effectively you are exchanging one asset for another that asset you are exchanging to is the land that you are buying which has some value and which should end up on the asset side of your balance sheet unfortunately particularly with fixed assets where no two ones are alike such as land it 's often very hard to know the exact value unless and until you sell it an appraiser can get you an estimate but only sealing a deal with an actual buyer can get you an exact value and at that point the asset is no longer yours

no the equipment costs are not necessarily a direct expense depending on the time of purchase and type of the expenditure you may need to capitalize it and depreciate it over time for example if you buy a computer you 'll have to depreciate it over 5 years some expenditures can be expensed under section 179 rules but there are certain conditions to be made including business revenue so if your business revenue is $ 3 k your sec 179 deduction is limited to $ 3 k even if more purchases can qualify not every purchase qualifies for sec 179 treatment and not all the state tax rules conform to the federal treatment get a professional advice from a cpa ea licensed in your state

that was a major statistic that i ca n't find honestly i did n't look but i know it is out there that supporters of obama care would use basically they said a large portion of those that are uninsured are healthy people between the ages of 18 35 who do n't see the need for health insurance ca n't afford health insurance or feel like they are never going to die or get sick so what s the point so the argument was if the pool for people paying for health insurance increases with a majority of that increase being people who will not use the system very much then rates should drop for everyone since there are more healthy people covering for the unhealthy people    i did n't assume that was how it was marketed while it was being proposed

there are some who argue that you should lease an electric car these factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying the technology is still new and is advancing rapidly in 2 3 years the newer model may have significantly improved features range and efficiency as well as lower prices if you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest leasing can make it a smoother transition it is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles this is both because of the above factors but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined the models for predicting gas car prices have been for decades ev manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations when you lease a car you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value if at the end of the lease the market value of the car is higher than the residual value you can purchase the car at the predetermined price making yourself some extra money if the value is lower than the residual you can return the car or renegotiate i know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it the rest bought used vehicles coming off lease which can also be a good deal

here 's one reason that 's being overlooked in answers so far this is for your comment on 's answer how do credit card companies make money sure there 's interest charges but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money and by people defaulting on their debt entering bankruptcy the other way they make money is by processing transactions they get a cut of whatever you buy if you 're a high income person and you 're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card your business is worth more they will be willing to bribe you with things like cash back frequent flier miles and insurance on your auto rentals so that they can be your 1 go to card   this works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall american express get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers wallets but that was mentioned in other answers if you 're not a high income person your business is worth less if you go somewhere asking for credit they 're going to try and give you a card which will earn them the most money which probably is n't the one where they give you back 50 of their transaction fee in rewards it 's a calculated risk since they still have to compete against cash debit cards and all the other credit card companies so they do n't have you totally over a barrel but you should n't expect as many freebies either

one implication is the added fees if you are investing in something with a trading cost or commission such as your stock purchase if you pay low costs to trade e.g. with a discount broker and do n't switch your investments often then costs overall should remain reasonable but always be aware of your costs and seek to minimize them

in general saving money should be prioritized over extra debt payments every dollar that you spend paying down a debt will decrease the amount of principal owed this will directly decrease the future interest payments you will make however as time goes on you are dealing with a smaller and smaller set of principal additionally it is assumed that your income will grow or at least keep pace with inflation making the debt more on the other hand every dollar you save or invest now will increase your future income also making the future debt more not only that but the longer you save the more value to you get from having saved meaning you should save as early as possible finally the benefits of paying down the mortgage early end when the mortgage is completely paid off while the benefits of saving will continue and even grow after the house is owned free and clear   that is if you have an extra $ 100,000 to put into the mortgage during the life of the loan you could sink that into the mortgage and see it disappear or you could invest it and reap the dividends for the rest of your life caveat emptor behavior trumps numbers this only works if you will actually be disciplined about saving the extra money rather than paying off debt if you 're the kind of person for whom money burns a hole in your pocket until you spend it then use it on debt but if you are able to save and invest that money you will be better off in the long run

they already do it is just sneaky how it is done   they have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country   they do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits   they do n't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders   that is without even getting into and prohibition legislation   one way they could easily keep money flowing to hollywood would be an additional tax refund that applies to legitimate entertainment costs   or perhaps doing as canada does and adding taxes to storage media   they can also continue to cut web freedom options and bandwidth   every bit of legislation i see come down the pipe with only a couple of notable exceptions such as has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile at the expense of everyone else   edit   i would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare and in fact we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes   it is so hyper inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels     we have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system   this chart in particular shows the problem     this was just in 2008 costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate   so yes the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

gt there may not be anything shameful about doing that but that scenario is indeed a business people do not shutter a profitable successful business and then go to work for someone else   not necessarily   it may very well be a planned exit not all businesses will nor should they be expected to or planned to endure into perpetuity just because the corporate charter sets no specific limit to the duration of the corporate entity does not mean that it is and certainly not that it needs to be   and a business that may be quite profitable to run even if it 's final pre closing year is less so is not necessarily a failure in fact closing an operation down while it is still slightly profitable and before it begins losing money and/or selling it 's assets off while they still have substantial investment value may in fact be the wisest move especially financially speaking which counts as anything but a failure   plus there are several industries where a temporary existence of a firm is recognized as a positive thing take films as an example a new company with a pre planned limited lifespan will often be formed to craft and produce the film and cease to exist once that task has been completed   and i think the hand wringing about restaurants is especially if ever there was is a business niche that was subject to fad amp fashion and the even nature of people 's tastes it would be the boutique segment of the restaurant industry even the ones or chains that do manage to survive often do so by dramatically changing their menus brand amp character so that a decade later they barely resemble their former selves   sure there are also other segments of the industry that are generally stable but many of them tend to be slow or no growth as well   gt;i believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self employed and business owners in the same breath someone who 's self employed basically owns a job his income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself    it covers an entire spectrum and the lines are rather fuzzy   yes a lot of self employed people whether configured as sole proprietorships partnerships llc 's or full corporations are by intent and probably always will be simply job replacement businesses and again there is nothing wrong with that whether they endure for a year 5 years 10 years or an entire lifetime how or why people have come to view this as somehow of less merit than someone being gainfully employed for someone else has always puzzled me   but some of those just as some of the part time or on the side businesses can take on an unexpected unplanned life of their own and grow into substantial enterprises that employ hundreds and even thousands of people over multiple decades after the fact the owners will often at least publicly claim that it was all part of the plan but in several cases where i know the founder owner personally i know from private conversation that that simply was n't the case   gt;a business owner on the other hand has processes equipment staff ip in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning   you are speaking of someone who has achieved a certain level of success and a certain size of operations   gt;these are different people with different goals and can not be lumped into the same demographic block   any and all blocks are going to be subjective and in a very real sense the dividing lines placed at rather arbitrary segments a particular named block will be very true from one point of view with lots of things that correlate and appear to be uniformly applicable and yet fallacious from another where there is again a whole spectrum of distinctions

a credit default swap is a derivative a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset a cds in essence is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default the typical arrangement is that a holder of non risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non risk free credit defaults banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors   banks will typically buy on mortgages and corporate bonds paying part of the income from interest payments received to have the right to force counterparties typically hedge funds and insurance companies to swap national treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default   the banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers households and corporations hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell because they are usually overflowing with risk free assets yet are starved for income

read the book pie fund your company without funds you can be given 5 over four years and in four years they hire someone and give him twice as much as you for working a month and not sacrificing his salary at all   over the four years the idiot who offered you the deal will waste investors money on obvious stupid things because he does n't know anything about how to build what he 's asking you to build causing the need for more investment and the dilution of your equity i 'm speaking from personal experience   do n't even do this start your own company if you 're working for free and tell the idiot who offered you 5 you 'll offer him 2 for four years of him working for you for free

where are you getting the idea that i think there is any altruism whatsoever in what whole foods does you are missing the point entirely let me make it perfectly clear they are selling me what i personally want and selling it to me in the way i personally want it     every single grocery store is consumerist i 've been shopping at whole foods for almost 30 years and the reason is because whole foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me and then delivering the experience of shopping in a safeway 's or the like is ugly uncomfortable cold and smelly they are too big and take forever to get from one item i want to another they are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious    what makes you think whole foods is in any way more deceptive than walmart publix costco etc because they responded to a market that wanted quality food that could be traced back to it 's source why would n't they respond to that    it is a myth that wf is selling only luxury food and drink items i can go into a wf and see local produce what is so extravagant about that   gt;do you ever wonder if maybe that passion is appealed to and marketer towards by businesses   i 'm thrilled that it is that means i can access food that i want and enjoy and it costs less than it would otherwise i can buy sugar free bacon at whole foods yay i feel great about that i ca n't get that at safeway     do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets do n't collectively far whole foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce that they do n't sacrifice quality for profits     where do you live that commercial grocery chains are somehow operating from the goodness of their hearts tell yourself whatever you want but if you have the impression that wf has somehow fooling me thanks for your concern but i 'm good i love that they figured out what i want to eat and how i want to shop for it

i think that if the price does not go very far up then your order will open on 101 because you are setting a limit order if suddenly the price goes up very quickly or with a even then you may not be given a position but this is with a limit order and it is better to check with the broker there are also warrants in which you can adjust the price range for example from 101 to 103 and at a sharp price jump it is possible for you and would not give a position at a price of 101 but perhaps 103 would get

the geniuses behind this infographic are part of a marketing industry trend that aims to exploit social media as a free advertising medium period reddit is difficult to advertise for free on and the writer of this blog post admits to this in an attempt to be more clever than all the other social media experts out there they are making the claim that a marketer can get on reddit establish a presence as a redditor then start shilling these claims are not only impossible to verify but the effort it would take to do something like this just to do marketing seems like a bad investment in addition to the things they mention on their little chart redditors do not like being manipulated by marketers and would downvote at best and get you banned at worst unless there is something about reddit that i do n't know which is certainly a possibility

it 's very hard to measure the worth of an abstract concept like money particularly over long periods of time in the modern era we have things like the consumer price index cpi in the united states where the bureau of labor statistics literally sends shoppers out to find prices of things and surveys people to find out what they buy this results in a variety of indexes which get reported by media outlets as inflation or deflation if the change in value goes the other way there are also other measurements available like the mit billion prices project which attempt to make their own reading of the worth of currencies those kinds of things are about the only ways to measure a currency 's change in value to itself because a currency is basically only worth what one can buy with it while it is n't all the world 's currencies combined there is a concept of the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights which is a basket of five currencies used by world central banks to help back each other 's currencies and is very occasionally used as a unit of currency for international contracts one might be able to compare the price of one currency to that of the or even to any other weighted average of world currencies that one wanted but i do n't think it 's done nearly as often as comparing currencies to the basket of goods one can buy to find inflation even though one might think what would be important to measure would be overall money supply inflation much more often people care more about measuring price inflation occasionally people worry about wage inflation but generally that 's considered a result of high price inflation in order to try to keep this on topic as a personal finance thing rather than an economics thing i guess the question is why do you want to know if you have some assets in a particular currency you probably care most about what you 'll be able to buy with them in the future when you want or need to spend them in that sense it 's inflation that you 're likely caring about the most if you 're trying to figure out which currency to keep your assets in it largely depends on what currency your future expenses are likely to be in though i can imagine that one might want to move out of a particular currency if there 's a lot of political instability that you 're expecting to lead to high inflation in a currency for a time

market makers shortened mm in an exchange are generally required to list both a bid and ask price to allow both buyers and sellers to trade and keep the market moving   however a more general idea of a mm may includes companies off an exchange say large banks acting as broker dealers in an over the counter market are not required to give a simultaneous bid ask but often will on request   so it might depend on where you are getting this data but likely the bid ask was quoted simultaneously an exchange like the nasdaq for instance may have multiple mms for a given market   the market spread will be from the highest bid to the lowest ask over all the mms   the highest bid and lowest ask may come from different mms and any particular mm often will have a larger spread the size of the spread gives a rough idea of how much a mm is trying to make off of a round trip trade buying than immediately selling to someone else or selling than immediately buying from someone else   of course immediate round trip trades are not always possible and there are many other complications   however half the spread is a rough indicator of how much they hope to make off of a single trade

first off i 'm very sorry for your loss   depending on when the money comes in i would park it and give it some time   after that one of the best investments is paying off debt   right now your net worth is less than 30 k and that is really not even accessible until retirement   if the money is there to pay off the house i would do that   if there is n't enough to pay off the house then i would pay off the automobile and put all or a sizable portion of the remainder into the house   now you have very little risk in your life and most likely much more monthly income to invest in 401 k iras college funds or any other investment life insurance is mostly to replace your income if there are people counting on that income spouse kids etc   normally this would be invested to hopefully replace that income with the growth of the money   in your case it does n't sound like you were relying on your father 's income so this can go to clean up current debt finally depending on your relationship what kind of person your father was and how he was with financials what do you think he would want you to do with it

it depends on the rules in the specific places you stay   specific places being countries or states    some states may consider pension payments to be taxable income others may not   some may consider presence for x days to constitute residency x days may be 60 days in a calendar year whether or not those days are continuous    it does n't matter so much where your mailbox or mail handling service is located it matters you may owe taxes in more than one place   some states will allow you to offset other states taxes against theirs   some states in the us are really harsh on income taxes   it 's my understanding that if you own real estate in new york all of your income no matter the source is taxable income in new york whether or not you were ever in the state that year ultimately you ca n't just put up your hand and say that 's my tax domicile so i 'm exempt from all your taxes   there is no umbrella us regulation on this topic the states determine who they consider to be residents and how those residents are to be taxed while it 's possible you may be considered a resident of multiple states and owe income taxes in multiple states it 's equally possible that you wo n't meet the residency criteria for any state regardless of whether or not that state has an income tax   the issue you face as addressed in 's answer oklahoma will consider you a resident of ok until you have established residency somewhere else

like keshlam mentioned insurance and investment should not generally be mixed term insurance is the best and cheapest insurance this would work out better than money back option you have i.e. take a term insurance for the same amount invest the difference between the premium of term insurance and money back option even if you invest this difference in bank fd 's the return is much more than what your money back policy gives pension plans are not advisable although has in recent times streamlined quite a bit of it there is still some amount that goes into commission plus the returns from annuity providers the yearly payment you get after retirement is less than what you get from fd 's i.e. currently the annuity rates are in the range of 5 6 and one year fd 's are in the range of 7 8 the only reason one need to go with pension plan or money bank plan would be if one is not financially disciplined or ca n't   reconcile to the fact that term insurance in spite of not giving any returns is much better

in less than two decades more than half of all publicly traded companies have disappeared there were u.s. stocks in november 1997 according to the center for research in security prices at the university of chicago ’s booth school of business nowadays there are fewer than 3,600   a close look at the data helps explain why stock pickers have been underperforming and the shrinking number of companies should make all investors more skeptical about the market beating claims of recently trendy strategies   back in november 1997 there were more than 2,500 small stocks and nearly 4,000 tiny microcap stocks according to crsp at the end of 2016 fewer than 1,200 small and just under 1,900 microcap stocks were left   most of those companies melted away between 2000 and 2012 but the numbers so far show no signs of recovering   several factors explain the shrinking number of stocks analysts say including the regulatory red tape that discourages smaller companies from going and staying public the flood of venture capital funding that enables young companies to stay private longer and the rise of private equity funds whose buyouts take shares off the public market   for stock pickers differentiating among the remaining choices is an even harder game than it was when the market consisted of twice as many companies says michael an investment strategist at credit suisse in new york who wrote a report this spring titled the incredible shrinking universe of stocks   that ’s because the surviving companies tend to be fewer bigger older more profitable and easier to analyze he says making stock picking much more competitive   consider small stock funds often they compare themselves to the russell 2000 an index of the u.s. stocks ranked through 3,000 by total market value twenty years ago there were over 4,000 stocks smaller than the inclusion cutoff for the russell 2000 says pastor a finance professor at the university of chicago that number is down to less than 1,000 today   so fund managers have far fewer stocks to choose from if they venture outside the index the very area where the best bargains might be found more money chasing fewer stocks could lead some fund managers to buy regardless of value   eric is a veteran portfolio manager with a solid record of investing in small stocks last year he took the drastic step of shutting down his roughly $ 400 million mutual fund river road independent value and giving his investors their money back   prices got so crazy in small caps i fired myself he says my portfolio was 90 in cash at the end because i could n’t find anything to buy if i ’d kept investing i was sure i ’d lose people their money   he adds it was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done professionally but i did n’t feel i had a choice i knew my companies were overvalued   mr. hopes to return to the market when in his view values become attractive again he does n’t expect recent conditions to be permanent   the evaporation of thousands of companies may have one enduring result however and it could catch many investors by surprise   most research on historical returns points out mr. is based on the days when the stock market had twice as many companies as it does today was the population of companies so different then he asks that the inferences we draw from it might no longer be valid   so called factor investing also known as systematic or smart beta investing picks hundreds or thousands of stocks at a time based on common sources of risk and return among them how big companies are how much their shares fluctuate how expensive their shares are relative to asset value and so on   but the historical outperformance of many such factors may have been driven largely by the tiniest companies exactly those that have disappeared from the market in droves   before concluding that small stocks or cheap value stocks will the market as as they did in the past you should pause to consider how they will perform without the from thousands of tiny stocks that no longer exist   the stock market has more than tripled in the past eight years so the eclipse of so many companies has n’t been a catastrophe but it does imply that investing in some of the market ’s strategies might be less profitable in the future than they looked in the past

there are several camps for stock valuation and much of it boils down to your investment style   a growth investor will not consider something with a 50x p e ratio to be overvalued but a value investor certainly would i would recommend looking up the fama french n factor model it was i believe they have released newer papers which introduce other factors and reading the intelligent investor by benjamin graham   graham 's methodology is practically canon for many investors and the methodology focuses on value while outlining quantitative factors for determining if a stock is under or over valued

do i need an investment adviser   no but you may want to explore the idea of having one is he going to tell me anything that my accountant ca n't   probably how much expertise are you expecting from your accountant here do you think your accountant knows everything within the of money from taxes insurance products investments and all your choices and what would work or would n't seems like it could be a tall order to my mind my accountant did say to come to him for advice on investment business    issues so he is willing but is he able not asking about his    competence but rather is there something that only an investment    adviser can provide by law that an accountant ca n't not that i know though do n't forget how much expertise are you expecting here from one person is this person intended to answer all your money questions but is n't that something that my accountant could should do perhaps though how well are you expecting one person to be aware of so much stuff i want you to know all the tax law so i can minimize taxes maximize my investment returns cover me with adequate insurance and protect my savings seems like a bit much to put on one entity do i need either of them wo n't the internet and sites like this one    suffice need no however how much time are you prepared to spend learning the basics of strategies that work for you how much money are you prepared to put into things to learn what works and does n't while it is your decision consider how to what extent do you diagnose your medical issues through the internet versus going to see a doctor be careful of how much of a do it yourself approach you want to go here and recognize that there are multiple approaches that may work the question is which trade offs are ok for you

question are you saying that buying a call is better than buying a vertical spread regardless of fees or only because of fees if the former you are saying that buying a call and selling a vertical spread will always be profitable which effectively means you 're going short an out of the money call while that 's a good strategy it does n't guarantee profit and will lose money exactly when the vertical spread is a better strategy than buying the call outright the most direct answer to your question in comments if the stock goes down you lose less money with the vertical spread than you do with a simple call in return for this lower risk you give up gains if the stock goes above the higher calls strike price

i consider speculation to be a security purchase where the point is to sell it to someone for a higher price   day trading is completely speculative i consider investment to be a purchase you make for its underlying value you are buying it at that price because you believe the present value of the future payments is higher than the price you are paying i may sell an investment if a higher price is offered than i think it 's worth or if the business situation changes but i do n't plan on it    hedging is a third type of security purchase where you are decreasing your overall risk   if you are a hog farmer selling hog futures on the cme is hedging because it locks in the amount you get per hog regardless of what the price of does commodities markets only have and speculators   investors do n't make sense it does n't have an underlying value
