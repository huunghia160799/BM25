believe it or not unless you directly contact an accountant with experience in this field or a lawyer you may have a tough time getting a direct answer from a reputable source   the reason is two fold   first legally defining in game assets is exceptionally difficult from a legal taxation stand point   who really owns this data   you or the company that has built the and manages the servers containing all of the data you can buy and sell what is effectively data on their servers but the truth is they own the code the servers the data your access rights etc and at any point in time could terminate everything within their systems   this would render the value of your accounts worthless as such most countries have overwhelmingly avoided the taxation of in game inventory because it 's not really   instead in game goods are only taxed when they are exchanged for local currency   this is considered a general sale   there may be tax codes in your region for the sale of digital goods   otherwise it should be taxed as sale a standard good with no special stipulations the bottom line is that you should n't expect to find much reliable information on this topic on the internet   law 's have n't been defined regarding in game content worth and taxing of sales and if you want to know how you should pay your taxes on these transactions you need to talk to a good accountant a lawyer or both

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

first lets understand what convexity means convexity   convexity refers to non in a financial model in other    words if the price of an underlying variable changes the price of an    output does not change linearly but depends on the second derivative    or loosely speaking higher order terms of the modeling function    geometrically the model is no longer flat but curved and the degree    of is called the convexity okay so for us idiots this means if the price of abc we will call p is determined by x and y. then if x decreases by 5 then the value of p might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on y is y who cares its not important for us to know we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it so if we chart this the line would look like a curve clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea so now in terms of options convexity is also known as gamma it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like is the convexity of options so lets define gamma gamma the rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset 's price so the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset in other words the gamma shows the option delta 's sensitivity to market price changes or gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so the answer is if we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying your case the vix really that simple well kinda to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it but yes being long gamma means being long volatility an example of being long gamma is a long straddle side note i personally do trade the vix and it can be very volatile you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading vix options some resources what does it mean to be long gamma in options trading long gamma how to make a long gamma position work for you delta investopedia straddles strangles further reading if your interested even more reading

when you invest in an s&p500 index fund that is priced in usd the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index since both the equities and the index fund are priced in usd the fund in your question however is priced in eur for a fund like this to match the performance of the s&p500 which is priced in usd as closely as possible it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate if the fund simply converted eur to usd then invested in an s&p500 index fund priced in usd the eur priced fund may fail to match the usd priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary i assumed the current value of the usd priced s&p500 index fund is 1,600 usd share the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur if you purchase one share of this index using eur you would pay eur share   if the s&p500 increases 10 to usd share and the exchange rate remains unchanged the value of the your investment in the eur fund also increases by 10 both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1   however the currency risk comes into play when the eur usd exchange rate changes take the 10 increase in the price of the usd index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the eur to 1.4 usd eur   although the usd priced index gained 10 the appreciation of the eur means that the eur value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation for investments priced in eur that invest in securities priced in usd the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track the fund you linked to uses swap contracts which i discuss in detail below to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate since these derivatives are n't free the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the s&p500 index and the s&p 500 euro hedged index   also it 's important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes this holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency like adr 's or gdr 's i wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context   there are several ways to investors be they institutional or individual can hedge against currency risk ishares offers an etf that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index and uses a over the counter currency swap contract called a month forward fx contract to hedge against the associated currency risk in these contracts two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency at some time in the future this allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period a month in the case of the ishares etf and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period   there are other forms of currency swaps equity swaps etc that could be used to hedge against currency risk in general two parties agree to swap one quantity like a eur cash flow payments of a fixed interest rate etc for another quantity like a usd cash flow payments based on a floating interest rate etc in many cases these are over the counter transactions there is n't necessarily a standardized definition   for example if the european manager of a fund that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 usd eur above the current exchange rate he may find another party that is holding usd and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of eur usd the other party could be an american fund manager that manages a usd price fund that tracks the ftse by swapping usd and eur both parties can at a price lock in their desired exchange rates   i want to clear up something else in your question too it 's not correct that the s&p 500 is completely unrelated to the euro far from it there are many cases in which the eur usd exchange rate and the level of the s&p500 index could be related for example troublesome economic news in europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as european investors flee to safety e.g. invest in treasury bills however this economic news could also cause us investors to feel that the global economy wo n't recover as soon as hoped which could affect the s&p500   if the euro appreciated against the dollar for whatever reason this could increase profits for us businesses that earn part of their profits in europe if a us company earns 1 million eur and the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur the company earns 1.3 million usd if the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 usd eur in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million eur they now earn 1.4 million usd even without additional sales the us company earned a higher usd profit which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price thus affecting the s&p500 combining examples 1 and 2 if a us company earns some of its profits in europe and a recession hits in the eu two things could happen simultaneously a the company 's sales decline as european consumers scale back their spending and b the euro depreciates against the dollar as european investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies usd or not the company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the eur   there are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the s&p500 or more generally the european and american economies the balance of trade investor and consumer confidence exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another the spread of asset mortgage backed securities from us financial firms to european banks companies municipalities etc all play a role   one example of this last point comes from this article which includes an interesting line among the victims of america ’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in norway which lost a total of $ 125 million through subprime mortgage related investments long story short these municipalities had mortgage backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from far down the line subprime mortgages on us homes i do n't know the specific cities but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world 's economies are when an american family 's payment on their subprime mortgage in say chicago can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of say norway

in general people make a few key mistakes with property 1 not factoring in depreciation properly houses are perpetually falling down and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well particularly in bad areas accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5 20 range per year depending on the property area add insurance to this as well 2 related to 1 they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve when in reality a lot of the house price rise is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up no investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1 so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth   3 failure to price in the huge transaction costs often per sale and capital gains other taxes depends on the exact tax structure where you are these add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently 4 costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents having to fill check evict fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else ’s again has to be factored in 5 liquidity issues selling houses in down markets is very very hard they are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices as the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage rents collapse loss of job etc they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system negative equity etc these factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses 6 finally if you ’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise locking yourself into contracts activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential particularly in fast moving jobs like software development   without more details on the exact legal framework area house type etc it ’s hard to give more specific advise but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above so if the numbers you ’re running are coming out close it ’s probably not worth it and you ’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds

i 'm not sure there 's a good reason to do a closing the books ceremony for personal finance accounting and you 're not only wanting to do that but have a fiscal year that 's different from the calendar year yikes my understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their retained earnings and such are for investors and tax purposes generally individuals would n't think of their finances in those terms it 's certainly not impossible though gnucash for example implements a closing books feature which is designed to create transactions for each income and expenses account into an end of year equity retained earnings account it does n't do any sort of closing out of assets or liabilities however and i 'm not sure how that would make any sense as you 'd transfer it from your asset to the end of year closing account and then transfer it back as an opening balance for the next year if you want to keep each year completely separate the page about closing books in the gnucash wiki mentions that one can create a separate gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file then importing that tree and the balances into a new file i expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data though while your question does n't seem to be specific to gnucash i just mention it because it 's the accounting tool i 'm most familiar with i 'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality i would however like to point out this section from the gnucash manual note that closing the books in gnucash is unnecessary you do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period gnucash ’s built in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods in fact closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports do n’t currently understand closing transactions so from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero and that 's largely why i 'm just not sure what your goals are if you want to look at your transactions for a certain time to just focus on the range of years i 'm interested in for any given purpose as you say then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates the idea of closing books comes from a time when you 'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you did n't need to refer to them regularly computers now have no challenges storing every account from the beginning of time at all and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you 're looking for easily if you do n't want to look at the old data just do n't include them in your reports i 'm pretty sure that 's the better way to keep the books manageable

interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out   there is a very significant reason actually a couple that the banks are sitting on reserves   1 the large banks have huge derivative exposure and huge potential losses and anyone who denies that has apparently been hiding under a rock and missed the news of while the reserves held are not enough to cover all of those potential derivative losses nor do they have to the bankers are uncertain of what their real exposure is and so they want to and indeed are probably being told to hold onto enough to prevent a catastrophic insolvency situation   2 the fed is paying interest on excess reserves likewise this is no secret this serves a two fold purpose of making the banks appear to be solvent even in the face of potentially huge derivative exposure and secondarily it is a way to gift the banks with money known as them   what krugman is engaging in is simple misdirection now whether this is because he actually believes his own bullshit or whether he is being intellectually dishonest is anyone 's guess 's razor would tell us it is the former rather than the latter but that is n't really in a single case and is rather a general principle occam 's razor does n't tell us anything in regard to this since either is a fairly simple and straight forward explanation and given the history of economists as being professional amp in service of the financial amp government establishment the latter is at least as likely as the former

the process would look something like   1 register your investment company with the sec 2 get the etf approved by the sec   3 get a custodian bank likely requires min assets of a few million 4 get listed on an exchange like by meeting requirements and have an ipo    1 and 2 probably require a lot of time and fees and would be wise to have a lawyer advising 3 is obviously difficult due to asset requirements and 4 would probably involve an investment bank plus more fees

you are giving your parents a short term loan the value of that loan is likely far less than the gift tax exclusion for the year you only need to account for the money you loaned to them and the money they paid back this is not income for you unless they pay interest it is not a gift from them because they are just paying you back

it 's extra work for you to purchase a vehicle that has an outstanding lien on it it 's not uncommon but there are things to take care of and watch out for really all it means is that the vehicle you 're trying to purchase has n't been paid for in full by the current owner where things can get dodgy is ensuring that all outstanding debts are paid against the vehicle at the time you take ownership of it otherwise the owners of those debts could still reclaim the vehicle   here 's a good article about making this kind of purchase

you should plan 1 3 months for an emergency fund   saving 6 months of expenses is recommended by many but you have a lot of goals to accomplish and youth is impatient   early in your life you have a lot of building saving that you need to do you can find a good car for under $ 5000   it might take some effort and you might not get quite the car you want but if you save for 5 6 months you should have a decent car   my son is a college student and bought a sedan earlier this year for about $ 4000 onto the house thing   as you said at $ 11,000 expenses yearly plus about $ 10,000 saved you are making low 30 's   using a common rule of thumb of 25 for housing you really can not afford more than about $ 600 for housing you probably want to wait on that first house for awhile down payments really should be about 20 and depending upon the area of the country a modest house might be $ 120,000 or $   even on a $ 120,000 the 20 down payment would be $ 24,000 as you have student loans $ 20,000 you should put together a plan to pay them off perhaps allocating half your savings amount to paying down the student loans and half to saving as you are young you should have strong salary gains in the first few years and once you are closer to $ you might find the numbers working better for housing my worry is that you are spending $ 22,000 out of about $ for living expenses   that you are saving is great and you are putting aside a good amount   but you want to target saving 30 40 if you can

so you dislike unions   why were unions necessary in the first place   is that problem resolved or will it crop up again if they go away   my belief is that unions or rather the problems they solved are still necessary   but their methods need oversight just as much as businesses need to be held accountable for how they treat their employees   government paying their employees well should n’t be an issue   we should be paying all employees well   but we are on a race to the bottom when it comes to employee wages   when we can outsource our work to other countries by building american businesses their and get rewarded for it we have the field our own employees have to compete against   when those businesses pay pennies on the dollar that they have to pay here our employees compete

taking examples from this loosely googled page if you find or calculate the standard deviation volatility of the returns from your various investment classes you will find they range from low risk low volatility such as cash to high risk high volatility such as strategic growth   the risk rating volatility is a good indicator of how reactive to market conditions your investment is likely to be   as you can see below from to the high risk index performed really well but it was also most reactive when the market subsequently turned down   the medium risk indices performed the best over the chart period 2010 to 2013 but it could have turned out different   generally you choose your investment according to your risk appetite how much you 're willing to risk   you might play safe with say 30 cash 60 medium risk 10 high risk   then again are you paying someone to manage cash which you might be able to do for free in a bank assuming for a moment european 3 and equity tracker 9 had the same medium risk profile then holding 50 50 would also add some currency diversification which is usually advisable   however the main choice is down to risk appetite to address your specific question my main interest for now is between stockmarket growth and strategic growth first thing to do is check their volatilities for a further level of sophistication you can check how they are correlated against each other   if they are inversely correlated i.e. one goes up when the other goes down then holding some of each could be a good diversification fyi an introduction to investment theory the historical returns are important too but the investment classes your pension fund is offering will probably be reasonably aligned on a risk return basis   you should check though   i.e. do they line up on a plot of 3 year return vs volatility e.g. the line through sa cash sa bonds vol target 20 sa equity   source

currently the quantity theory of money is widely accepted as an accurate model of inflation in the long run consequently there is now broad agreement among economists that in the long run the inflation rate is essentially dependent on the growth rate of money supply however in the short and medium term inflation may be affected by supply and demand pressures in the economy and influenced by the relative elasticity of wages prices and interest rates wikipedia inflation causes you also asked can you give any reference that explains that this encouraging people to work is one of the reasons government prints money see the list of positive effects of inflation in that article

in a traditional ira or 401k or equivalent income tax is not taken on the money when it is deposited or when dividends are reinvested but money you take out after you can do do without penalty is taxed as if it were ordinary income i believe that 's true i do n't think you get to take the long term investment rate note that roth is the opposite you pay income tax up front before putting money into the retirement account but you will eventually withdraw without paying any additional   tax at that time unlike normal investments neither of these requires tracking the details to know how much tax to pay there are no taxes due on the reinvested dividends and you do n't need to track cost basis

firstly you have to know exactly what you are asking here   what you have if you own bitcoins is a private key that allows you to make a change to the blockchain that can assign a piece of information from yourself to the next person nothing more nothing less   the fact that this small piece of information is considered to have a market value is a matter of opinion and is to owning a domain name a domain name is an entry in a register that has equal weight to all other entries but the market determines if that information eg has any more value than say another less well know domain bitcoin is the same an entry in a register and the market decides which entry is more valuable than another   so what exactly are you wanting to declare to fincen are you willing to declare the ownership of private key of course not so what then an private key can be generated at will by anyone without even needing to own or transact in bitcoins and that same private key would be equally valid on any of the 1000 's of other bitcoin the point i want to make is that owning a private key in itself is not valuable therefore you do not need nor would anyone advise notifying fincen of that fact to put this into context every time you connect to online banking your computer secretly generates a new random private key to secure your communications with the bank theoretically that same private key could also be used to sign a bitcoin transaction do you need to declare every private key your computer generates no secondly if you are using any of the latest generation of hd wallets your private key changes with every single transaction are you seriously saying that you want to take it on your shoulders to inform fincen every time you move information bitcoin amounts around even in your own wallets the fact is fincen could never discover your ownership of bitcoins or any of the 1000s of alt coins other than by you informing them of this fact   you may want to carefully consider the personal implications of starting down this road especially as all fincen would need to do is subpoena your bitcoin private key to steal your so called funds as they have done recently to other more prominent persons in the community edit to clarify the points raised in comments you do not own the private key to the bitcoins stored on a foreign exchange nor can you discover it the exchange owns the private key you therefore do not either technically have control over the coins is a very good example here they went out of business because they allowed their private keys to be used by some other party who was able to siphon off the coins your balance is only yours when you own the private keys and the ability to spend any other situation you can neither recover the bitcoin to sell to pay for any taxes due so you do not either have the legal right nor the technical right to consider those coins in your possession   for those who do not understand the technical or legal implications of private key ownership please do not speculate about what owning bitcoin actually means or how ownership can be discovered holding bitcoin is not illegal and the us government who until recently were the single largest holder of bitcoin demonstrate simply by this fact alone that there is nothing here

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

in most cases if you are a member of the class the law firm will contact you via postal mail to notify you of the class action and give you an opportunity to opt in or opt out of participating in any settlement that happens   more often than not they take the opt out approach meaning that if you do n't say you want out of the class it is assumed that you agree with the complaints as defined in the class action and would like to receive your portion of the money if there is a settlement   if you have n't gotten such a letter and you think you should have it is a good idea to contact the law firm how do you find the law firm usually some googling on class action and the name of the defendant company will get you there also check the legal section of the of the local newspaper they sometimes advertise them there   typically they are n't hard to find because it is in the law firm 's best interest to have everyone sign on to their class action for a number of reasons including if you have a lot of people who are supposedly it makes the defendant look more likely to be guilty and more participants can equate to higher settlement amounts for which the law firm gets a percentage that is why you see non stop ads on daytime tv for lawyers marketing class action cases and looking for people who took this drug or had that hip implant once a settlement occurs and you are a member of that class there are a number of ways you might get your piece including a credit to your account a check in the mail a coupon or some other consideration for your damages lame a promise that they will stop doing the bad thing and maybe some changes in your favor on the terms of your account a final note do n't get your hopes up the lawyers are usually the only ones who make any substantial money from these things not the class members i 've been paid settlements from lots of these things and it is rare for it to be more than $ 25 but the time the are divided i 've gotten numerous settlements where my share was less than a dollar there are some decent resources on but beware that although the site has some good information it is primarily just an ad for a also note that i am not affiliated with that site nor can i vouch for any information contained there they are not an impartial source so understand that when reading anything on there

the standard is actually 30 hours a week over a given period of time 3 12 months of the previous taxable year    the interesting problem for the employer who wants to offer benefits to as few employees as possible is erisa sec 510 according to the above poster companies want to avoid hiring full time positions however based on employer needs only hiring part time workers will not be feasible for many businesses furthermore if employers restrict hours for the purpose of denying access to benefits they may be violating erisa sec 510 which would lead to a major lawsuit for that business as erisa is an opt in class action statute as well as a generous attorney fee statute it 's easier for plaintiff 's lawyers to make the defense pay their legal fees see erisa v. it would be unwise for employers to simply refuse to hire any more full time employees   of course companies will be looking to avoid overpaying for benefits in any way they can but simplistic conclusions such as gave that they will not hire full time workers fails to grasp both the complexity of ppaca and the consequences of a given employer 's actions

loan officer here yes you pay the per diem i 'd recommend not paying it off for like 6 months you can pay it down to basically nothing and then hold it for six months and pay it off better for credit if it 's a simple interest rate most car loans are multiply the current principal balance by the interest rate and divide it by 365 that 's the per diem or daily interest for example 10,000 dollar auto loan at 3 10000 300 so each day the balance is 10k the loan cost 82 cents so in a month your first payment is 100 dollars goes to interest goes to principal then the new principal is so the next month another 30 days with the new per diem of the 100 payment is in principal in interest and so on

my understanding is that when you die the stocks are sold and then    the money is given to the beneficiary or the stock is repurchased in    the beneficiaries name this is wrong and the conclusion you draw from michael 's otherwise correct answer follows your false assumption   you seem to understand the estate tax federal threshold jersey would have its own and i have no idea how it works there if the decedent happened to trade in the tax year prior to passing normal tax rules apply   now if the executor chooses to sell off and liquidate the estate to cash there 's no further taxable gain a $ 5 m portfolio can have millions in long term gain but the step up basis pretty much negates all of it   if that 's the case the beneficiaries are n't likely to repurchase those shares in fact they might not even know what the list of stocks was unless they through the asset list but that sale was unnecessary assets can be up and distributed in kind each beneficiary getting their fraction of the number of shares of each stock and then your share of the $ 5 m has a stepped up basis meaning if you sell that day your gains are near zero you might owe a few dollars for whatever the share move in the time passing between the step up date and date you sell   i hope that clarifies your misunderstanding   by the way the irs is just an intermediary it 's congress that writes the laws including the tangled web of tax code the irs is the moral equivalent of a great customer service team working for a company we do n't care for

the simplest argument for overpayment is this let 's suppose your fixed rate mortgage has an interest rate of 4.00 every £ 1 you can afford to overpay gives you a guaranteed effective return of 4.00 gross yes your monthly mortgage payment will stay the same however the proportion of it that 's paying off interest every month will be less and the amount that 's actually going into acquiring the bricks and mortar of your home will be greater so in a sense your returns are inverted i.e. because every £ 1 you overpay is £ 1 you do n't need to keep paying 4 a year to continue borrowing in your case this return will be locked away for a few more years until you can remortgage the property however compared to some other things you could do with your excess £ this is a very generous and safe return that is well above the average rate of uk inflation for the past ten years let 's compare that to some other options for your extra £ cash savings the most competitive rate i can currently find for instant access is from icici if you are prepared to lock your money away until march 2020 building society has a fixed rate bond that will pay you gross on these accounts you pay income tax at your marginal rate on any interest received for a basic rate taxpayer that 's 20 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer that means 40 of this interest is deducted as tax in other words assuming you pay income tax at one of these rates to get an effective return of 4.00 on cash savings you 'd have to find an account paying cash isas these accounts are tax sheltered so the income tax equation is n't an issue however the best rate i can find on a 4 year fixed rate cash isa is from building society as you can see it 's a long way below the returns you can get from overpaying to find returns such as that you would have to take a lot more risk with your money for example stock market investments for example an index fund tracking the ftse 100 uk listed blue chip companies could have given you a total return of over the last 3 years past performance does not equal future returns over a longer time period this return should be better historical performance suggests somewhere between 5 to 6 is the norm but take a closer look and you 'll see that over the last six months of 2015 this fund had a negative return of i.e. for a time you 'd have been losing money how would you feel about that kind of volatility in conclusion i understand your frustration at having locked in to a long term fixed rate effectively insuring against rates going up then seeing rates stay low for longer than most commentators thought however overpaying your mortgage is one way you can turn this situation into a pretty good deal for yourself a 4 guaranteed return is one that most cash savers would envy in response to comments i 've uploaded a spreadsheet that i hope will make the numbers clearer i 've used an example of owing £ 100k over 25 years at an 4 interest and shown the scenarios with and without making a £ 100/month voluntary overpayment assuming your lender allows this here 's the sheet after one year you have made £ 1,200 in overpayments you now owe £ less than if you had n't overpaid   after five years you owe £ less on your mortgage having overpaid in £ 6,000 so far should you remortgage at this point that £ is your return so far and you also have £ 6k more equity in the property   if you keep going after 65 months you are paying more capital than interest out of your monthly payment this takes until 93 months without overpayments in total if you keep up £ 100/month overpayment you pay £ less interest overall and end your mortgage six years early you can play with the spreadsheet inputs to see the effect of different overpayment amounts hope this helps

in most cases of purchases the general advice is to save the money and    then make the purchase paying cash for a car is recommended over    paying credit for example for a house getting a mortgage is    recommended says who these rules of thumb hide the actual equations behind them they should be understood as not as the word of god the basics the basic idea is if you pay for something upfront you pay some fixed cost call it x where as with a loan you need to pay interest payments on x say i as well as at least fixed payments p at timeframe t resulting in some long term payment ix your assumption to some this obviously means upfront payments are better than interest payments as by the time the loan is paid off you will have paid more than x. this is a good rule of thumb like 's equations at low x high i and moderate t because all of that serves to make the end result ix > x. counter examples are there circumstances where the opposite is true here 's a simple but contrived one you do n't pay the full timeframe suppose you die declare bankruptcy move to another country or any other event that reduces t in such a way that xi is less than x. this actually is a big concern for older debtors or those who contract terminal illnesses as you ca n't squeeze those payments out of the dead this is basically manipulating the whole concept let 's try a less contrived example suppose you can get a return higher than i. i can currently get a loan at around 3 due to good credit but index funds in the long run tend to pay taking a loan and investing it may pay off and would be better than waiting to have the money even in some less than ideal markets this is basically manipulating t to deal with ix even less contrived and very real world suppose you know your cash flow will increase soon a promotion an inheritance a good market return it may be better to take the loan now enjoy whatever product you get until that cash flows in then pay it all off at once the enjoyment of the product will make the slight additional interest worth it this is n't so much manipulating any part of the equation it 's just you have different goals than the loan home loan analysis for long term mortgages x is high usually higher than a few years pay it would be a large burden to save that money for most people i is also typically fairly low p is directly related to i and the bank ca n't afford to raise payments too much or people will rent instead meaning p needs to be affordable this does not apply in very expensive areas which is why cities are often mostly renters t is also extremely long usually mortgages are for 15 or 30 years though 10 year options are available even with these shorter terms it 's basically the longest term loan a human will ever take this long term means there is plenty of time for the market to have a fluctuation and raise the investments current price above the remainder of the loan and interest accrued allowing you to sell at a profit as well consider the opportunity cost while saving money for a home you still need a place to live this additional cost is comparable to mortgage payments meaning x has a hidden constant the cost of renting often x + r > ix making taking a loan a better choice than saving up conclusion the general advice is a good heuristic for most common human payments we have relatively long life spans compared to most common payments and the opportunity cost of not having most goods is relatively low   however certain things have a high opportunity cost if you ca n't talk to hr you ca n't apply for jobs phone if you ca n't get to work you ca n't eat car and if you have no where to live it 's hard to keep a job house for things with high opportunity costs the interest payments are more than worth it

carmax will be interested in setting a price that allows them to make money on the reselling of the vehicle they wo n't offer you more than that the determination of the value compared to the value is based on condition and miles the refinancing of the auto loan could lower your monthly payment but may not save you any money in the short term the new lender will also want an evaluation of the vehicle and if it is less than the payoff amount of the current loan they will ask you to make a lump sum payment this is addition to the cost of getting the new loan setup if you can pay the delta between the value of the car and loan then do so when you sell the car do n't refinance unless you plan on keeping the car for many months or you are just adding paperwork to the transaction

none taken good thoughts it would be making the same mistake to blindly accept my criticism as many will make blindly accepting this journalist 's graphs let 's see if i can address your concerns   the reason the scale is problematic to me is exactly what you said   gt i hope people would be looking at more than just a line   and i do n't think that they do the scales were adjusted so that the lines were nearly identical on someone 's computer screen but that implies a false equivalency between the debts of households corporations state and local gov and the fed i think the author has left leaning read the accompanied article that outlines who you will vote for link on the last slide not necessarily a bad thing but he frames all of this from the idea that his statistics can not be skewed and he is therefore presenting central to the left 's argument is that the federal government 's size is not of the biggest concern and if you got the average american thinking that 15 trillion is no big deal because households have a huge debt too or corporations do too or states do too i believe that to be dangerous i think i identified his bias and that his graphs are slightly manipulated to coerce less individuals to his side happens all the time but all of those facts are dead on in regards to the data again trying to keep my politics out of this simply criticizing the graphs and the subtle message they are sending under the guise of being neutral   i would agree with your point normally since contractors are temporary and often as you pointed out cost efficient from a benefits standpoint they also tend to be more efficient but this is not central to our point the problem is that the government has the longest war in our history going but we are n't really fighting anyone for the scale of our spending trillions of dollars have gone into this effort and one of the results has been the development of a quasi economy in iraq and now the numbers are staggering of how many of these people are employed or make a living off of this war effort but this is not like most contractors where you would add them to the dod 's budget as you pointed out and the difference i would is the permanent status of the employment after what length of time would you say a contractor for the dod working on computer programs in the pentagon is the equivalent of an employee and therefore must be counted in statistics such as the one the graph in question purports to 2 years 5 years certainly after a decade right remember the graph is trying to show that the number of government employees is not a problem or at least not a significant but calling an apple a banana does n't make it yellow i think political slight in hand with statistics as important as these should be criminal   sorry i got long winded but i hope i addressed your concerns it sounds like you are one of the few people who thinks critically when presented with data such as that which is in these 64 slides but remember for every one of you there may be a thousand people who are brainwashed by any data you put in front of them

in addition to the higher risk as pointed out by you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short   if you own a stock you are shorting the irs could view the transaction as a sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to wash sale rules   this added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced you should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to re the uptick rule or some circuit breaker variant designed to prevent short sellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short   in the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time   in either case should such a rule be then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells    as to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of etf 's classified as inverse exchange traded funds etf 's for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question   one such example for a common broad market is ticker sh the short s&p500 etf which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the s&p500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly + 15 performance of the s&p500 over the last 12 months sh is down roughly -15 over the same period   the wikipedia article on inverse etf 's lists a number of other such funds covering various markets    i think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent   a more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like cd 's or treasury instruments   in that case you preserve your capital regardless of what happens in the market using an inverse etf otoh means that if the market went bull instead of bear you would lose money instead of merely holding your position

the mutual fund is legally its own company that you 're investing in with its own expenses mutual fund expense ratios are a calculated value not a promise that you 'll pay a certain percentage on a particular day that is to say at the end of their fiscal year a fund will total up how much it spent on administration and divide it by the total assets under management to calculate what the expense ratio is for that year and publish it in the annual report but you ca n't just pay the fee for any given year in a regular account you certainly could look at what expenses were paid for each fund by multiplying the expense ratio by your investment and use it in some way to figure out how much additional you want to contribute to make it whole again but it makes about as much sense as trying to pay the commission for buying a single stock out of one checking account while paying for the share price out of another it may help you in some sort of mental accounting of expenses but since it 's all your money and the expenses are all part of what you 're paying to be able to invest it 's not really doing much good since money is fungible in a retirement account with contribution limits it still does n't really make sense since any contribution from outside funds to try to pay for expense ratios would be counted as contributions like any other again i guess it could somehow help you account for how much money you wanted to contribute in a year but i 'm not really sure it would help you much some funds or brokerages do have non expense ratio based fees and in some cases you can pay for those from outside the account and there are a couple cases where for a retirement account this lets you keep your contributions invested while paying for fees from outside funds this may be the kind of thing that your coworker was referring to though it 's hard to tell exactly from your description usually it 's best just to have investments with as low fees as possible regardless since they 're one of the biggest drags on returns and i 'd be very wary of any brokerage based fees when there are very cheap and free mutual fund brokerages out there

this is an old question that has an accepted answer but it has gotten bumped due to an edit and the answers given are incorrect i am assuming this means that every other friday the company is going into the open public market buying those shares and then giving it out to the employees no companies will internally hold shares that it intends to offer employees as additional compensation there are no open market transactions so the market price of the stock does not change at least not due to buying pressure   the only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses these share may come through an initial buyback from the market but more common is that when companies issue new shares they keep some internally for exactly this situation   if they issued new shares every pay period it would dilute the existing shares several times a quarter which would be difficult to account for

do n't worry the cyprus situation could only occur because those banks were paying interest rates well above eu market rates and the government did not tax them at all even the one time tax discussed is comparable to e.g. germany and the netherlands if you average over the last 5 years the simple solution is to just spread your money over multiple banks with assets at each bank staying below eur there are more than 100 banks large enough that they 'll come under ecb supervision this year you 'd be able to squirrel away over 10 million there each branch of the dutch is insured individually so you could even save 14 million there alone and they 're collectively aaa rated additionally those savings will then be backed by more than 10 governments many of which are still aaa rated   once you have to worry about those limits you should really talk to an independent advisor investing in aaa government bonds is also pretty safe the examples given by littleadv all involve known risky bonds e.g. argentina was on a credit watch and paying 16 interest rates

i disagree with most of the answers here so far because they are either too risky or too conservative and do n't take taxes and retirement into consideration op keep in mind the higher the potential return the greater the risk you have n't stated your risk tolerance but consider the following pick a certain percentage of your $ 10k to invest for the long term pick a low cost index fund like the s&p500 index historically this investment does well in the long run and it gets you started in investing keep the balance the money you will need for the short term right where it is not earning much interest have you started saving for retirement consider starting a roth ira if you are in the usa with some of the money for tax advantages it 's up to you to decide how much you should invest and how much you need to keep on hand for emergencies or short term needs there are plenty related questions on this forum you can browse

firstly if a stock costs $ 50 this second the bid ask would have to be   if the bid ask were the stock would cost $ 51 this second   what you 're likely referring to is the last trade not the cost   the last trading price is history and does n't apply to future transactions to make it simple let 's define a simple order book   say there is a bid to buy 100 at $ 49 200 at $ 48 500 at $ 47   if you place a market order to sell 100 shares it should all get filled at $ 49   if you had placed a market order to sell 200 shares instead half should get filled at $ 49 and half at $ 48   this is of course assuming no one else places an order before you get yours submitted   if someone beats you to the 100 share lot then your order could get filled at lower than what you thought you 'd get   if your internet connection is slow or there is a lot of latency in the data from the exchange then things like this could happen   also there are many ecns in addition to the exchanges which may have different order books   there are also trades which for some reason get delayed and show up later in the time and sales window but to answer the question of why someone would want to sell low the only reason i could think is they desire to drive the price down

i 'm expanding on what had added to his answer the assumption of same tax bracket in retirement is convenient but simplistic if you are in for instance the second lowest bracket now and happen to remain in the second lowest bracket for retirement then roth and traditional account options may seem equal and your math backs that up on the surface but that 's making an implicit assumption that tax rates will be constant yet tax brackets and rates can change and they do the proof i.e. your 15 bracket could become say the 17 bracket or perhaps the 13 bracket all the while you might remain in the second lowest bracket so given the potential for fluctuating tax rates it 's easy to see that there can be a case where a traditional tax deferred account can yield more after tax income than a roth post tax account even if you remain in the same bracket when your tax bracket 's tax rate declines so do n't just consider what bracket you expect to be in consider also whether you expect tax rates to go up down or remain the same for twenty something young folk retirement is a long way away ~40 years and i think in that time frame it is far more likely that the tax brackets wo n't have the same underlying tax rates that they have now of course we ca n't know for sure which direction tax rates will head in but an educated guess can help is your government deep in debt or flush with extra cash on the other hand if you do n't feel comfortable making predictions much better than simply assuming brackets and rates will stay the same as now so it does n't matter is to instead hedge your bets save some of your retirement money in a roth style account and some in a traditional pre tax account consider it tax diversification see also my answer at this older but related question

well all of the previous answers already mentioned the upcoming scam and danger situation for your financial position i thoroughly read all answers and wanted to add a few more lines on it already shows details of it any kind of financial transaction involving a complete stranger is the first big scam tag that shows up and this should always never fall in type situation if you open a new bank account or give away any existing bank account to this lady other than just losing some amount you might pay earlier than clearing checks you deposited on behalf of your stranger partner depending on their target plan experience with your bank account they can make you a victim of a bigger crime there is a full length of scam plans like sending you false checks to deposit and ask you withdrew money to send them back to even having very big incoming transaction to your account sitting idle on your account which might originate from a crime beyond the financial domain you can try to be smart thinking in mind well let them send some i will never send them back before bank declare the deposited checks got and clear and send back the amount after keeping your share but still you will face problems later even if your account fills up with real money and after confirming with bank you find it ok and never return them scam a scammer still you will not have any valid authority or answer describing how why you got this money if someone ask you later depending on scammer 's ability they might even give you control over fund to spend for your own to gain some trust from your part on this type of scam it is a sign of an even bigger danger i live such a country bangladesh from where recently they successfully transferred out around us$ 10 millions using a bank account of an outsider like you keeping in between source of money and final unknown destination the result is the owner operator of those accounts used for these transfers are now under law enforcement pressure not only just to find out where ultimately money has gone but for sure they will face some degree of charge for helping transfer of illegal money overseas for someone who is not part of a full scam chain it is a big deal it might ruin their life forever to be on the safe side and help protect others from falling on the same type of problem you may contact your local law enforcement agency depending on the situation they might be interested to run a sting operation using your information and support to catch and stop the crime going to happen soon or later i would give a rare chance of 2 legitimate reason for anyone to use a third party bank account to pay some other living either different country still it is not legal but a lower type crime but obviously they will not ask randomly over the internet social network sites in your case this is a real scam be careful and stay safe good luck

paypal has a very generous buyer protection program   that means that the buyer can dispute receiving the goods and get their money back fairly easily compared to credit cards   for this reason craigslist and other sites recommend not accepting paypal   payments   i know that many transactions go through them   but unless i really trust someone paypal would not be an option for me unless it was the money transfer different rules not as easy to get the money back   however this may be breaking paypal terms of service so i would read them carefully before i went this route    there have been reports of paypal putting extended holds on funds and effectively seizing the money by refusing to release the funds   i have never had this happen though i did have a sale on ebay reversed though the item was never returned but there are many reports of it on the internet as far as the boa option i would contact them and see what they recommend i would find out what their policies are on reversing the transfers and on providing your account number   they may have a special deposit only account number you could provide the buyers   but i would want to learn as much about the system as i could before i started using it    the internet has turned the old adage of buyer beware into seller beware   there are many schemes that con artists have come up with to defraud sellers   i received several offers from people wanting to pay me with a cashiers check for a few items i recently sold on craigslist   it is scary how prevalent these fraudsters have become

without reading the source from your description it seems that the author believes that this particular company was undervalued in the marketplace it seems that investors were blinded by a small dividend without considering the actual value of the company they were owners of remember that a shareholder has the right to their proportion of the company 's net value and that amount will be distributed both a in the form of dividends and b on liquidation of the company   theoretically eps is an indication of how much value an investor 's single share has increased by in the year of course this is not accurate because accounting income does not directly correlate with company value increase but it is a good indicator this means in this example that each share had a return of $ 10 of which the investors only received $ 1 the remainder sat in the company for further investment considering that liquidation may never happen particularly within the time frame that a particular investor wants to hold a share some investors may undervalue share return that does not come in the form of a dividend this may or may not be legitimate because if the company reinvests its profits in poorer performing projects the investors would have been better off getting the dividend immediately however some value does need to be given to the non dividend ownership of the company it seems the author believes that investors failing to consider value of the non dividend part of the corporation 's shares in question led to an of the company 's shares in the market

the major drawback to borrowing to invest i.e. using leverage is that your return on investment must be high enough to overcome the cost of finance the average return on the s&p 500 is about 9.8 from cnbc a typical unsecured personal loan will have an interest rate of around 18 36 apr from nerdwallet this means that on average you will be paying more interest than you are receiving in returns so are losing money on the margin investment sometimes the s&p falls and over those periods you would be paying out interest having lost money so will have a negative return you may have better credit and so be able to get a lower rate but i do n't know your loan terms currently secured loans such as remortgaging your house will have lower costs but come with more life changing risks the above assumes that you are getting financing by directly borrowing money however it is also possible to trade on margin this is where you post a proportion of the value that you wish to trade with as collateral against a loan to buy the security this form of finance is normally used by day traders and other short term holders of stocks although the financing costs here are low i am not charged an interest rate on intraday margin trading there are very high costs if you exceed the term of the loan an example is that i am charged a fee if i hold a position overnight and my profits and losses are at that time if i am in a losing position at that time the process and fee can result in not having enough margin to recover the position and the loss of a potentially profit making position additionally if the amount of collateral cash margin posted is insufficient to cover the expected losses as calculated by your broker they will initiate a margin call asking for more collateral money if you do not or can not post this extra margin your losing position will be cashed out and you will take as a loss the total loss at that time since the market can change very rapidly such as in a flash crash this can result in your losing more money than you had in the first place as this is essentially a loan you can be bankrupted by this overall using leverage to invest magnifies your potential profits but it also magnifies your potential losses in many cases this could be sufficient to lose you more money than you had originally invested in addition to you need to consider the cost of finance and that your return over the course of the loan needs to be higher than your cost of finance as well as inflation and other opportunity costs of capital the s&p 500 is a relatively low volatility market in general so is unlikely to return losses in any given period that will mean that leverage of 1.25 times will take you into losses beyond your own capital investment but it is not impossible the low level of risk automatically means that your returns are lower and so your cost of capital is likely to be a large proportion of your returns and your returns may not completely cover the cost of capital even when you are making money the key thing if you are going to trade or invest on leverage is to understand the terms and costs of your leverage and discount them from any returns that you receive before declaring to yourself that you are profitable it is even more important than usual to know how your positions are doing and whether you are covering your cost of capital when using leverage it is also very important to know the terms of your leverage in detail especially what will happen when and if your credit runs out for whatever reason be it the end of the financing period the length of the loan or your leverage ratio gets too high you should also be aware of the costs of closing out the loan early should you need to do so and how to factor that into your investing decisions

johnny   i recently bought my first home as well and i have worked in the credit business not mortgage so i think i can answer some of your questions   disclaimer first that i 'm in ny and home buying does vary from state to state in my experience pre qual is not too different from pre approval   neither represents any real on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information   it 's theoretically possible that a seller would choose a pre approved buyer over a pre qualified buyer all other things being equal but all other things are seldom equal remember also that you do n't need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the pre qual   the pre qual just shows that you are probably credit worthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers   once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure   banks do n't need to have pulled your credit to quote rates but they will need to have a general idea of your fico range   once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan they will pull a hard bureau and if your scores are different from what you said before the rate may change but within the same range you 'll generally be ok   also banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1 as it costs them for each pull 2 potential downsides to this approach also make sure you have a mortgage funding clause in your contract as banks are unpredictable and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer not a legal factory the extra few hundred $ are worth it do n't this credit stuff too much   find a good house for a good price and get a no nonsense mortgage that you fully understand no exotic stuff   good luck

it would be very unusual and very erroneous to have a company 's stock be included in the long term investments on the balance sheet   it would cause feedback loops which would create financial documents and stock prices   that 's how your question would be interpreted if true   this is not the case stock prices are never mentioned on the financial documents   the stock price you hear being reported is information provided by parties who are not reporting as part of the company   the financial documents are provided by the company   they will be audited internally and externally to make sure that they can be presented to the market stock prices are quoted and by brokers at the stock exchange or equivalent service   they are negotiated and the latest sale tells you what it has sold for   what price this has been reported never works its way onto the financial document so what use are stock prices are for those within the company   the stock price is very useful for guessing how much money they can raise by issuing stock or buying back stock   raising money is important for expansion of the company or to procure money for when avenues of debt are not optimal buying back stock is important if major shareholders want more control of the company

first you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state in fact you should have had it before you started but that ship has sailed you 're talking about start up expenses you can generally deduct up to $ 5000 in the year your business starts and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months 15 years this is per the irc sec the amortization starts when your business is active i.e. you can buy the property but not actually open the restaurant you can not start the depreciation i have a couple questions about accounting should all the money i    spent be a part of capital spending or is it just a part of it if it qualifies as start up organizational expenses it should be capitalized if it is spent on capital assets then it should also be capitalized but for different reasons and differently for example costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start up expense buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately as buying the tables and if it is a salary expense to your employees then it is a current expense and should n't be capitalized our company is llc if this matters   it matters to how it affects your personal tax return

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

yes you could avoid capital gains tax altogether however capital gains are used in determining your tax bracket even though they are not taxed at that rate   this would only work in situations where your total capital gains and ordinary income kept you in the 0 longterm capital gains bracket you ca n't realize a million dollars in capital gains and have no tax burden due to lack of ordinary income you can potentially save some money by realizing capital gains strategically giving up income in an attempt to save on taxes rarely makes sense

you pay tax on the entire amount not just the capital gains    when cashing out such a plan you would pay the top marginal tax rate on the full amount plus another 10 in penalties   it is very likely that the additional income of the balance withdrawal will increase your top marginal rate    it is impossible to come up with a precise answer as we do n't know the following however you can take a concept away from this that is important   you will be taxed and penalized on the entire 401 k balance not just the capital gain    in the best case scenario that is you had little or no income in a given year   under current tax law you would owe about 31 of your 401 k balance in taxes   as this is such an inefficient use of money most authors recommend against it except in the case of extreme circumstances

firstly make sure annual income exceeds annual expenses the difference is what you have available for saving   secondly you should have tiers of savings from most to least liquid and least to most rewarding the core of personal finance is managing the flow of money between these tiers to balance maximizing return on savings with budget constraints for example insurance effectively allows society to move money from savings to stocks and bonds and a savings account lets the bank loan out a bit of your money to people buying assets like homes   note that the above set of accounts is just a template from which you should customize you might want to add in an fsa or hsa extra loan payments or taxable brokerage accounts depending on your cash flow debt and tax situation

it depends   very generally when yields go up stocks go down and when yields go down stocks go up as has been happening lately if we look at the yield of the 10 year bond it reflects future expectations for interest rates   if the rate today is very low but expectations are that the short term rates will go up that would be reflected in a higher yield simply because no one would buy the longer term bond if they could simply wait out and get a better return on term investments   if expectations are that the rate is going down you get what 's called an inverted yield curve   the inverted yield curve is usually a sign of economic trouble ahead   yields are also influenced by inflation expectations as is alluding in his answer so   if the stock market crashes because the economy is doing poorly and if interest rates are relatively high then people would expect the rates to go down and therefore bonds will go up however if there 's rampant inflation and the rates are going up we can expect stocks and bonds to move in opposite directions   another interpretation of that is that one would expect stock prices to track inflation pretty well because company revenue is going to go up with inflation   if we 're just talking about a bump in the road correction in a healthy economy i would n't expect that to have much of an immediate effect though bonds might go down a little bit in the short term but possibly even more in the long term as interest rates eventually head higher   another scenario is a very low interest rate environment as today with a stock market crash and not a lot of room for yields to go further down both stocks and bonds are influenced by current interest rates interest rate expectations current inflation inflation expectations and stock price expectation   add noise and stir

i recently decided to out on a music system for the house which included a turntable i used to have a proper dj setup but that 's long been sold off and most of the records are of a genre i do n't listen to now but i wanted to enjoy the records i do listen to and also buy some more   one thing that struck me when listening through albums is how much more closely i listen to each track when it 's not part of an endless spotify playlist when you physically have to get up and flip the disc over every 3 tracks or so you pay so much more attention to it and it becomes a much more pleasurable experience rather than just background   it 's more labour intensive but that 's a good thing good music deserves your attention   edit also for all the replies to this that and make out it 's just a fad buying a vinyl offers so much more in terms of a physical product than cds or downloads i have a copy of 's my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and the actual design of the triple and all the included artwork is amazing    yes it 's more convenient to just get apple music or whatever but that 's not what we 're talking about it 's the reason people go a decent rather than mcdonalds

through that link what exactly do you want me to read   the changes to inflation under clinton were made to made to more accurately account for inflation so if anything things are more accurate now than in 1950 the precise details of the changes are documented on the bls website somewhere but the short of it is that the old inflation definition had the problem where if prices went up or down and then back to original you would still have inflation which is incorrect the changes lessen this effect many independent groups like the billion price project agree that the current bls methods for measuring inflation is more correct than the older methods and match actual pricing better note that the billion prices index does not include hedonics as far as i know and in practice the amount of goods to which hedonics applies in the cpi basket is so small as to not matter much anyways finally the idea is sound one should account for to products as adding value so comparing a 20 tv from 1970 to one today needs more than merely retail price to evaluate price increases certainly gets more tv than back then   if you have claims otherwise i 'd like to hear them until then i suspect we more accurately measure gdp and inflation than in 1950 not less accurately   all this still does not show there is more of the numbers than in 1950 and the poster above you said it seems he 's making excuses to obtain an he desires rather than the correct approach which is to measure carefully and then think what it means   and no one here said gdp was a universal measure of economic health

yes you often can buy stocks directly from the company at little or no transaction cost   many companies have either a dividend reinvestment plan drip or a direct stock plan   with these plans you purchase shares directly from the company although often there is a third party transfer agent that handles the transaction and the stock is issued in your name   this differs from purchasing stock from a broker where the stock normally remains in the name of the broker generally in order to begin participating in a drip you need to already be a registered stockholder   this means that you need to purchase your first share of stock outside of the drip and get it in your name   after that you can register with the drip and purchase additional shares directly from the company   if the company has a you can begin purchasing shares directly without first being a stockholder with the advent of discount brokers drips do not save as much money for regular investors as they once did   however they can still sometimes save money for someone who wants to purchase shares on a regular basis over even a discount broker if you are interested in drips and and want to learn more there is an informative website at that has lots of information on which drips are available and how to get started

the idea of an index is that it is representative of the market or a specific market segment as a whole so it will move as the market does thus past performance is not really relevant unless you want to bank on relative differences between different countries economies but that 's not the point by far the most important aspect when choosing index funds is the ongoing cost usually expressed as total expense ratio ter which tells you how much of your investment will be eaten up by trading fees and to pay the funds operating costs and profits this is where index funds beat traditional actively managed funds it should be below 0.5 the next question is how buying and selling the funds works and what costs it incurs do you have to open a dedicated account or can you use a brokerage account at your bank is there an account management fee do you have to buy the funds at a markup can you get a discount on it are there flat trading fees is there a minimum investment what lot sizes are possible can you set up a monthly payment plan can you automatically reinvest dividends coupons   then of course you have to decide which index i.e. which market you want to buy into my answer in the other question apparently did n't make it clear but i was talking only about stock indices you should generally stick to broad established indices like the msci world s&p 500 euro stoxx or in australia the all among those it makes some sense to just choose your home country 's main index because that eliminates currency risk and is also often cheaper alternatively you might want to use the opportunity to diversify internationally so that if your country 's economy tanks you wo n't lose your job and see your investment take a dive finally you should of course choose a well established reputable issuer but this is n't really a business for startups neither shady nor consumer friendly anyway

you 're right the asset allocation is one fundamental thing you want to get right in your portfolio   i agree 110   if you really want to understand asset allocation i suggest any and all of the following three books all by the same author william j. bernstein they are excellent and yes i 've read each   from a theory perspective and being about asset allocation specifically the intelligent asset allocator is a good choice   whereas the next two books are more accessible and more complete covering topics including investor psychology history financial products you can use to implement a strategy etc   got the time read them all i finished reading his latest book the investor 's manifesto two weeks ago   here are some choice quotes from chapter 3 the nature of the portfolio that address some of the points you 've asked about   all emphasis below is mine page 74 the good news is the asset allocation    process is not really that hard   the    investor only makes two important    decisions page 76 rather younger investors should own a    higher portion of stocks because they    have the ability to apply their    regular savings to the markets at    depressed prices   more precisely    young investors possess more human capital than financial capital    that is their total future earnings    dwarf their savings and investments     from a financial perspective human    capital looks like a bond whose    coupons escalate with inflation page 78 the most important asset allocation    decision is the overall stock bind    mix start with age = bond allocation    rule of thumb i.e. because the younger you are you already have bond like income from anticipated employment earnings the older you get the less bond like income you have in your future so buy more bonds in your portfolio he also mentions adjusting that with respect to one 's risk tolerance   if you ca n't take the ups and downs of the market adjust the stock portion down up to 20 less if you can stomach the risk without a problem adjust the stock portion up up to 20 more page 86 in reference to a specific example where two assets that and are    purchased in a 50/50 split and adjusted back to targets this process called rebalancing    provides the investor with an    automatic buy low sell high bias that over the long run usually    but not always improves returns page 87 the essence of portfolio construction    is the combination of asset classes    that move in different directions at    least some of the time finally this gem on pages 88 and 89 is there a way of scientifically picking the very best future    allocation which offers the maximum    return for the minimum risk   no but    people still try       continues with description of    markowitz 's mean variance analysis    technique    it took    investment professionals quite a while    to realize that limitation of    mean variance analysis and other    black box techniques for allocating    assets i could go on quoting relevant pieces he even goes into much detail on constructing an asset allocation suitable for a large portfolio containing a variety of different stock asset classes but i suggest you read the book

the price gaps up because the offer is for a price above the current price therefore people want to buy now before the price jumps to the offer level of course it does depend on the tone of the announcement   which party is making the announcement and are they announcing an offer or a deal if the price is $ 10 and the offer is for $ 12 then the price may quickly jump the early buyers will make the most quick money they hope that the deal is done quickly or if not the final price ends up higher   there are risks the company could reject the offer the due diligence could expose a problem the regulators could reject the deal based on anti trust issues the deal could take many months to complete or the final deal could be for shares in the new company   the risks are one reason people sell after the deal offer is announced in other cases the seller finally is seeing a profit or a smaller loss and wants out while they can

it sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well which is why it may seem like it does n't matter   fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends   one way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described   but multiples are inherently backward looking so for firms with good growth prospects they can be very poor estimates of future profitability when you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities   that 's all it could be that the market is overestimating that growth but you would need more information in order to conclude that   we call warren buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios   that may be in many cases but it does n't necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices   it 's just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described

i doubt you will get an answer equal to you ca n't save when you have debt because most mortgages are for decades very few people would be able to save for retirement if they had to wait to be mortgage free the difficulty in saving occurs when the interest rate is very high 18 or more and the interest is not deductible such as with credit cards the minimum payment for your mortgage is 30 of your income if that does n't include taxes and homeowners insurance in the 30 then for the united states that would be considered too large while the general plan to pay down the mortgage is a good idea make sure that you are able to handle the minimum payments before starting to increase the payments try the minimum for a year or two before getting aggressive the calculation is based on the interest rate of the mortgage the interest rate of the savings account and the potential tax deduction of the mortgage and the tax rate on the earned interest putting extra money into a mortgage but missing out on matching retirement money would also have to be figured into the calculation make sure you do save for retirement kids education and emergencies unless your country has a complex system where the money can flow in and out of the mortgage then once you put extra money into the mortgage you ca n't get it back when the car dies   the nice thing about putting extra money into a mortgage is that you can do it either in an organized way or only when you feel comfortable so it is not urgent for you to commit to a plan immediately one thing to avoid is a plan that charges you a fee to add extra money or charges a fee to switch to a bi weekly mortgage while your ideas is good these plans should never cost any money to start and may be a scam if a 3rd party gets between you and the lender

if you have an increasing population but a steady supply of wealth then there will be a perceived effect of decline   as the average person can afford less and less   if inflation is factored in this effect is accelerated as the value of money is reduced but the availability of that money is as well   in this model those who have tend to accumulate as they produce and those who do not have tend to lose wealth as they consume to fill basic needs at ever increasing prices with a declining source of income exacerbating the effect    if you control your population prevent inflation and deflation and maintain a constant production consumption cycle that is perfectly in balance then you could have that utopian society   but in practice there is waste   that waste makes maintaining that balance impractical at best   people have different desires and motivations   so while that utopian society that you propose seems possible at the theoretical level when solely looking at the mechanics and economics in practice it becomes more about managing the people   which makes the task virtually impossible as for the debt issue that is the strategy of many of the western nations   most of them experienced growth over the last 50 years that was unprecedented in history   many of them simply assumed it would continue indefinitely and failed to plan for a downturn   in addition they planned for the growth and borrowed based on the assumptions   when the growth slowed several continued to use the same projections for their budgeting with the effect of spending money they would not take in   so in a way yes the growth is needed to service the continued growth of debt unless the government issuing that debt is willing to reduce its expenses

thanks for the feedback    the cost is $ 20,000 to 50,000 sqft    ya i am just looking for a rough idea of what a similar newer building is costing i figured what we are paying is really high as the building is extremely old and designated as a heritage site so we ca n't just knock it down beautiful building just not very efficient    the newer building is the route i think we are gon na end up going not sure what we can do with the current building as not too many options for resale we ca n't adjust the lease rates to compensate for the cost as the tenants are all seniors and it is an integrated care home a change to apartments would prove difficult as there are no kitchens in 90 of the suites   we are currently paying approximately $ 0.40 a month to heat all electric and the estimate for the new building is $ so it is a pretty huge impact in comparison if it is possible but i have n't heard of a real building actually costing that little before    thanks for the suggestion for the ir i think i am gon na get some one in after the holidays to do a inspection to see if there is any short term fixes we can do with our system

based on past case law a check made payable to qualified charity and delivered e.g. placed in the mail on 12/31 would count as delivered as it is out of the hands of the donor would fall under the constructive receipt doctrine however for non charitable gifts e.g. gifts to family members it is the date the check is cashed honored by the receiving bank   this is important as the annual gift exclusion is just that annual   therefore if i gift my child $ 14,000 by writing a check on but they deposit it on then i have used my annual gift exclusion for 2015 and not 2014   this means i could not gift them anything further in 2015 btw the annual gift amount is for all gifts cash and non cash   most people do n't seem to realize this   if i give $ 14,000 of cash to my child and then also give them christmas gifts with a value of $ 1,000 i have exceeded my annual gift exclusion to that child   usually there are ways around this issue as i can give $ 14,000 to each and every person i want and if married my spouse can do the same   this allows us to give $ 14,000 from each of us to each child plus $ 14,000 from each of us to their spouse if married and $ 14,000 from each of us to each of their children if they have any

well it depends on whether or not your differentiating against if its capital stock or stock as in a share certificate in the company if its a share in the company then in my opinion using equity would be best as it is a form of an asset and does refer to a piece of ownership of the entity i would n't consider a share of stock a service since the service to you is say facebook or the broker who facilitates the transaction of buying or selling fb stock i also would not consider it a capital good as the capital good 's would be the referring to the actual capital like the servers other computer equipments etc

i find it interesting that you did n't include something like total bond or intermediate term in your graphic    if someone were to have just invested in the dji or sp500 then they would have ignored the tenants of the modern portfolio theory and not diversified adequately   i would n't have been able to stomach a portfolio of 100 stocks commodities or metals   my vote goes for 1 picking an asset allocation that reflects your tolerance for risk a good starting point is age in bonds i.e. if you 're 30 then hold 30 in bonds 2 save as if you 're not expecting annualized returns of 10 for example and save more 3 do n't try to pick the next winner instead broadly invest in the market and hold it   maybe gold and silver are bubbles soon to burst i for one do n't know   i do n't give the notion in the investment community much weight as it always is someday someone will be right i just do n't know who that someone is

this is the kind of scenario addressed by reddit 's /r personalfinance prime directive or i have $ x what should i do with it it follows a fairly linear for personal spending beginning with a budget and essential costs the gist of the is to cover your most immediate costs and risks first while also maximizing your benefits it sounds like you would fall somewhere around steps 1 and 3 step 2 wo n't apply since this is not pretax income if you do n't already have at least $ 1000 reserved in an emergency fund that 's a great place to start after that you 'll want to use the rest to pay down your debt your credit card debt is very high interest and should be treated as a financial emergency besides the balance of your gift you may want to throw whatever other funds you have saved beyond one month 's expenses at this problem as far as which card since you have multiple debts you 're faced with the classic choice of which payoff method to use snowball lowest balance first or avalanche highest interest rate first avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately personally since your 26 apr debt is so large and so high interest i would recommend focusing every available penny on that card until it is paid off and then never use it again again per the that means using everything left over after steps 0 2 are fulfilled

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

your first scenario involving shareholders in a private corp being limited by a contractual agreement is common in practice frequent clauses include methods of valuing the shares if someone wants to sell first right of refusal you have to attempt to sell to the other shareholders before you can sell to a 3rd party and many others these clauses are governed by contract law ie some clauses may be illegal in contract law and therefore could n't be applied here a universal shareholders agreement is just the same as the above but applied to more people you would never get an already public company to convert to a universal shareholders agreement because even 1 share voting no would block it due to corporate law limiting the power of a corporation from abusing minority shareholder value in practice these agreements universally exist at the start of incorporation or at least at the first moment shares become available an example is the canadian mega construction company which is employee owned when the original owner transferred the corporation to his employees there was a usa in place which still today governs how the corporation operates   in theory you could have a public company where most shares are already owned by the founders and 100 of remaining shares are owned by a specific group of individuals in which case you may be able to get a usa signed but it would n't really happen in practice   note that while is broadly owned by a large group of employees it is not a public company because any random schmuck ca n't simply buy a share on the toronto stock exchange i assume most exchanges would prevent corporations from being listed if they had ownership restrictions like this

if i understand correctly you describe putting a hold on an appartment as such a sum of money that you give to the owner of the appartment to let them hold it for you because you are probably going to rent in case you back out of the deal this money can mitigate the expected loss from turning down other candidates after asking them to hold the appartment for you you decided not to rent also you used the bank to get back the hold sum regardless of the legal details it seems very clear to me that after putting down a hold and walking away you should not get the money back   there may have been some things that distracted confused you call about the key but if you actually look at the things that happened it seems both right and practical to pay them their reclaimed hold as soon as possible

tldr   you will probably need to move to a different employer to get the raise you want need deserve some employers in the us punish longevity through a number of practices   my wife worked as a nurse for about 20 years   during that time she had many employers leveraging raises with job changes   she quit nursing about 6 years ago and was being paid $ at the time   she had a friend that worked in the same system for 18 years   they had the same position in the same hospital that friend 's current rate of pay   $   you probably do n't want to be that person given your stack overflow participation i would assume you are some type of web developer   i would recommend updating your resume and moving for a 20 increase or more   you 'll get it as it is a great time to be a web developer   spending on it tends to go in cycles and right now budgets are very healthy for hiring new talent    while your current company might not have enough money in the budget to give you a raise they would not hesitate hiring someone with your skills at 95 k if they had an opening   its common but frustrating to all that are involved except the bean counters that looks at people like us as commodities    think about this   both sides of the table agree that you deserve a 5 k raise   but lets say next year only 3k is in the budget    so you are out the 5k you should have been given this year plus the 2k that you wo n't get plus whatever raise was fair for you next year   that is a lot of money   time to go do n't bother on holding onto any illusions of a counter offer by your current employer   there will be too much resentment   shake the dust off your feet and move on     edit some naysayers will cite short work histories as problems for future employment   it could happen in a small number of shops but short work histories are common in technology that recruiters rarely bat an eye   if they do as with any objection it is up to you to sell yourself   in cracking the code interview the author cites that no one is really expecting you to stay beyond 5 years    something like this would work just fine   i left acme because there were indications of poor financial health   given the hot market at the time i was able to find a new position without the worry of pending layoffs   if you are a contractor six month assignments are the norm   also many technology resumes have overlapping assignments   its what happens when someone is in demand

having a separate checking account for the business makes sense it simplifies documenting your income expenses you can explain every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for non business items my credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever i wanted as the name on the check i think this looked a little better than having my name on the check i do n't see the need for a separate checking account for investing the money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees and can even earn a little interest unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me i fund iras and 529 plans this way we get paychecks 4 5 times a month but send money to each of the funds once a month you will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large if you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank the bank will want to move you to a business account

you do n't state a long term goal for your finances in your message but i 'm going to assume you want to retire early and retire well any other ideas i 'm missing out on a fairly common way to reach financial independence is to build one or more passive income streams   the money returned by stock investing capital gains and dividends is just one such type of stream   some others include owning rental properties being a passive owner of a business and producing goods that earn long term royalties instead of just an immediate exchange of time effort for cash     of these rental property is probably one of the most well known and easiest to learn about so i 'd suggest you start with that as a second type of investment if you feel you need to diversify from stock ownership   especially given your association with the military it is likely there is a nearby supply of private housing that is n't too expensive so easier to get started with and has a high rental demand so less risk in many ways    also with our continued current low rate environment now is the time to lock in long term mortgage rates   doing so will reap huge benefits as rates and rents will presumably rise from here though that is n't guaranteed regarding the idea of being a passive business owner keep in mind that this does n't necessarily mean starting a business yourself   instead you might look to become a partner by investing money with an existing or startup business or even buying an existing business or franchise   sometimes perfectly good business can be transferred for surprisingly little down with the right deal structure if you 're creative in any way producing goods to earn long term royalties might be a useful path to go down   writing books articles etc is just one example of this   there are other opportunities depending on your interests and skill but remember the focus ought to be on passive royalties rather than trading time and effort for immediate money   you only have so many hours in a year   would you rather spend 100 hours to earn $ 100 every year for 20 years or have to spend 100 hours per year for 20 years to earn that same $ 100 every year all that being said while you 're way ahead of the game for the average person of your age $ 30k cash $ 20k stocks unknown tsp balance low expenses i 'm not sure i 'd recommend trying to diversify quite yet for one thing i think you need to keep some amount of your $ 30k as cash to cover emergency situations   typically people would say 6 months living expenses for covering employment gaps but as you are in the military i do n't think it 's as likely you 'll lose your job   so instead i 'd approach it as how much of this cash do i need over the next 5 years   that is sum up $ x for the car $ y for fun travel $ z for emergencies etc   keep that amount as cash for now beyond that i 'd put the balance in your brokerage and get it working hard for you now   i do n't think an average of a 3 div yield is too hard to achieve even when picking a safe conservative portfolio   though you do run the risk of capital losses if invested   once your total portfolio tsp + brokerage is $ 100k or more then consider pulling the trigger on a second passive income stream by splitting off some of your brokerage balance   until then keep learning what you can about stock investing and also start the learning process on additional streams   always keep an eye out for any ways to kick additional streams off early if you can find a low cost entry    the $ 100k number is admittedly a rough guess pulled from the air   i just think splitting your efforts and money prior to this will limit your opportunities to get a good start on any additional streams   yes you could do it earlier but probably only with increased risk lower capital means less opportunities to pick from lower knowledge levels both stock investing and property rental also increase risk of making bad choices

as my business partner likes to say do n't at a barking dog it 's just not worth it   the unfortunate thing about finance is people who know what something is thinks that 's the same as knowing something*. it 's become pretty absurd at this point with everyone i 've interacted with in the industry over the years and everyone all too defensive of whatever it is they think they know   tesla does not earn an accounting profit absent any adjustments they are negative cash flow as well but it 's one of those rare cases where adjustments absolutely have to be made as they are material the business relies heavily on outside capital but a lot of it is the result of growth capex decisions as opposed to ones made for survival we do n't have the same set of books that capital providers get from tesla the ones that show you what you 're looking for in this argument but i can assure they do clear a net positive cash at this time in their history before their aggressive expansion plans are put into effect   we have a cool facebook community that i help run 2,000 people or so used to get into the weeds on stuff like this but lately they 've all been infected by crypto i sort of just sit on the sidelines now that is your true job security your competition getting attracted to shiny things

the price of a share has two components bid the highest price that someone who wants to buy shares is willing to pay for them ask the lowest price that someone who has a share is willing to sell it for the ask is always higher than the bid since if they were equal the buyer and seller would have a deal make a transaction and that repeats until they are not equal for stock with high volume there is usually a very small difference between the bid and ask but a stock with lower volume could have a major difference when you say that the share price is $ 100 that could mean different things you could be talking about the price that the shares sold for in the most recent transaction and that might not even be between the current bid and ask or you could be talking about any of the bid the ask or some value in between them if you have shares that you are interested in selling then the bid is what you could immediately sell a share for if you sell a share for $ 100 that means someone was willing to pay you $ 100 for it if after buying it they still want to buy more for $ 100 each or someone else does then the bid is still $ 100 and you have n't changed the price if no one else is willing to pay more than $ 90 for a share then the price would drop to $ 90 next time a transaction takes place and that s what you would be able to immediately sell the next share for

every time you buy or sell a share for some price somebody must have thought that that was exactly the right moment to sell or buy that share at that price and to trade with you every time a trade is made both sides think they are doing the smart thing most of the time one will turn out to be wrong the other right nothing in your proposed method of trading explains why you would be the side that was right more often so they 'll probably even out or maybe there are people in the market who actually do have a slightly better than average method and you 'll be wrong somewhat more often than right each trade has transaction costs if you simply hang on to your shares that 's more or less the same as evening out good trades and bad trades but without the transaction costs

this question is predicated on the assumption that investors prefer dividends as this depends on who you 're speaking to   some investors prefer growth stocks some which do n't pay dividends so in this case we 're covering the percent of investors who like dividend paying stocks it depends on who you ask and it also depends on how self aware they are because some people may give reasons that make little financial sense   the two major benefits that i hear are fundamentally psychological dividends are like mini paychecks   since people get a from receiving a paycheck i would predict the same holds true for receiving dividends   more than likely the brain feels a reward when getting dividends even if the dividend stock performs lower than a growth stock for a decade the experience of receiving dividends may feel more rewarding plus depending on the institution they may get a report or see the tax information for the year and that also feels good some value investors do n't reinvest dividends as they believe the price of the stock matters stocks are either cheap or expensive and automatic reinvestment to these investors implies that the price of a stock does n't matter so dividends allow them to rebuild their cash after a buy   they can either buy more shares if the stock is cheap or keep the cash if the stock is expensive   think about warren buffett here he purchased $ 3 billion worth of shares of wells fargo at approximately $ 8 12 a share in 2009 from my memory as people were shocked that be bought into a bank when no one liked banks   consider how much money he makes from dividends off that purchase alone and if he were to currently believe wells fargo was overpriced he could keep the cash and buy something else he believes is cheaper   in these cases dividends automatically build cash post buying and many value investors believe that one should always have cash on hand this second point is a little tricky because it can involve risk assessment some investors believe that high dividend paying stocks like mo wo n't experience the huge declines of indexes like the spy   mo routed the spy in 2009 29 vs. 19 and these investors believe that 's because it 's yield was too desired it feels safer to them the index side would argue but what happens in the long run   the problem i have with this argument which is frequent is that it does n't hold true for every high yield stock though some high yield stocks do show strong resistance levels during bear markets

yes but at the root of it is the consumer complaining that these trusted sources are not adhering to principles of journalistic integrity while they are desperately trying to survive thrive and adapt to a completely shifting paradigm where competition is lowering the bar and the same consumers are unwilling to step up and reward journalistic integrity this is what happens essentially we get what we pay for    we can lay blame on the media organizations as much as we care to but the reality is we ’ve reached a point where most people like to be given talking points and sound bites that their point of view rather than actually try to obtain facts and form their own opinions the truth is rarely in the bite size pieces our society today   trust in the media is at an all time low for no other reason than we allowed it to happen and rewarded the media for going down that path we ’ve created a system that does not reward what we say we want from media rather rewards the actions that show we want the complete opposite    if i may inquire how many people reading this pay any premium for good journalism i will be the first to sadly admit i do not   obviously this means i am also part of the problem despite making an effort to look at news from all sides i am just a guilty as most to reinforcing the same system that has destroyed journalistic integrity

how you use the metric is super important    because it subtracts cash it does not represent value   it represents the ongoing financing that will be necessary if both the equity plus debt is bought by one person who then pays himself a dividend with that free cash    so if you are private equity this measures your net investment at not the price you pay at t=0   if you are a retail investor who a wo n't be buying the debt b wo n't have any control over things like tax jurisdictions c wo n't be receiving any cash dividend etc etc the metric is pointless

it all has to do with risk and reward the risk is that interest rates will rise   to entice you to go with the variable they make it so it is cheaper if interest rates never rise your job is to guess whether interest rates are likely to go up or not in a first approximation you should go fixed the bank employs very smart people whose entire job is to know whether interest rates will go up or not those people chose the price difference between the two and it 's sure to favour the bank that is the risk of extra payments you 'll make on the variable is probably more than the but some people ca n't sleep at night if their payments or more realistically the interest part of their payments might double if that 's you go fixed if that 's not you understand that the actually has to be turned up a bit to get more people to go variable because of the sleeping at night feature think long and hard about your budget and what would happen if your payment jumped if you could handle it variable might be the better choice personally i have been taking variable on my mortgage for decades and now i do n't have one and never once regretted it i also my oldest child to take variable on her mortgage over this century so far if rates up they did n't tick up to the level the fixed was offered at mostly they have sat flat but if ever there was a world in which past performance does not predict future results it would be interest rate trends do your own research

as others mentioned the only clear reason to remain in debt is if you can find an investment that yields more than what you 're paying to maintain the debt this can happen if a debt was established during low rate period and you 're in a high rate period not what is happening now a speculative reason to keep debt is as an inflation bet if you believe money will shortly lose value you are better off repayment until the drop occurs however you 're not likely to be able to make these bets successfully hope this helps

to be honest i think a lot of people on this site are doing you a disservice by taking your idea as seriously as they are not only is this a horrible idea but i think you have some alarming misunderstandings about what it means to save for retirement first off precious metals are not an investment they are store of value the old saying that a gold coin would buy a suit 300 years ago and will still buy a suit today is pretty accurate buying precious metals and expecting them to appreciate in the future because they are undervalued is just flat out speculation and really does n't belong in a well planned retirement account unless it 's a very small part for the purposes of diversification so the upshot to all of this is the most likely outcome is you get zero return after inflation maybe you 'll get lucky or maybe you 'll be very unlucky next you would say that sure you 're giving up some expected return for a reduction in risk but you 've done away with diversification which is the most effective way to minimize risk and i 'm not sure what scenario you 're imagining that the stock market or any other reasonable investment does n't make any returns if you invest in a market wide index fund then the expected return is going to be roughly in proportion with productivity gains to say that there will be no appreciation of the stock market over the next 40 years is to say that technological progress will stop and/or we will have large scale economic disruptions that will wipe out 40 years of progress if that happens i would say it 's highly questionable whether silver will actually be worth anything at all i 'd rather have food property and firearms so to answer your question practically any other retirement savings plan would be better than the one that you currently outlined but the best plan is just to put your money in a very low cost index fund at vanguard and let it sit until you retire the expense ratios are so stupidly small that it 's not going to meaningfully affect your return

if you get your income in the currency you have the new loan in there is no exchange risk for the future assuming that you are able to get and serve that loan it reduces your cost so go for it yes if the currency exchange rate changes the right way over the next years you could have made a better deal but consider it could also go the other way if you really want to play this game do it separately by trading calls puts on the currency exchange rate see it as a separate and investment option

everybody on the car title will need to participate in the selling process the person who is buying the car will need everybody to sign the paperwork so that nobody months later tries to say they never agreed to sell the car the money will have to be sent to the lender to pay off the rest of the loan if the money is n't enough to pay off the loan everybody will have to decide how the extra money will be sent to the lender this will have to be done as part of the selling process because the lender does n't want you to sell the car and keep the cash once the car is gone so is the collateral and they ca n't take it back if you miss payments   if the cousin is too far away to participate in the selling of the car you may need the buyer and the lender to tell you how to proceeded if you are selling at a dealership they will know what documents and signatures will be needed the bank will also know what to do if the loan is almost paid off it may be easier to pay the loan first and then get the title without the lenders name before trying to sell it

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

if there are no dependents there is no need for life insurance   you mention getting insurance when it is not needed to protect you against some future risk if you have a policy and a disease crops up that would normally make you un you can keep your insurance for the rest of the term the cost for this would be very high you would have to have a term that would last decades to cover you until some future child is out of college if you never have somebody that depends on you for income there never is a need for life insurance

the treatment of employees has found a new low with the use of technology i was especially appalled by juice who schedules down to 15 minute increments with part time employees their rational is that it saves the company money and their employees do not have energy and during the second half of a shift   i own my company and have had the same employees for over 24 years through good times and bad they have always given me superior work with 150 effort clients ask me how i retain these great people here is the secret it is in the form of a story   two dog teams are in a race in the wilderness of alaska food is low and conditions are bad every night one of the made sure his dogs were feed and down first before he took care of himself with what little was left he loved his dogs and cared about his dogs well being every morning the dogs got up and pulled the through the deep snow they brought their master to the end of the race and saved his life    every night the other feed himself first and made sure he was warm after that he took care of his dogs with what little was left some of his dogs eventually ran away and some of his dogs died there were not enough dogs left to pull the and the froze to death in the alaska wilderness some of the last dogs ate him to survive   i doubt ms and ms from juice will grasp the moral of this story i am sure their turn over of employees is very high and the true cost of retraining new employees is not factored in to their fantastic business plan i find my clients are well pleased in part because they are assured they will have the services of my same employees who they know and trust to do a great job my employees have increased my business and its bottom line   advice to ms. and ms. 1 you best be and enthusiastic in the afternoon or a computer program may tell your boss to you and cut your pay 2 you better hope company is not hired by juice to create a program which does your jobs better and your services are no longer needed 3 watch your back and if you feel someone chewing on your leg you now know the reason why

i 've been a p2p lending investor for months now with lending club with no complaints money wise i 'm making a w/ notes i 've had a few late payers and one couple oddly enough in both are in law enforcement declare bankruptcy but b c i 've invested as little money as possible into each note $ my diversification helps reduce volatility and risk to capital   having tough underwriting standards is very important but i think it all comes down to loaning only to those you think will pay you back not someone with a sob story or a long history of defaults that might sound like a no brainer but if you 're a bit of a cynic and have really tough screening criteria it 's possible to lower your default rate if you 're patient and deploy your money slowly over time at least my returns and default rate of zero would imply it 's possible so far i blog about it quite a bit so if anyone wants to check out my lending club investments thus far please check it out apologies if this is considered spam since i 'm a new member of the site but thought it relevant to the discussion

patience is the key here i hate to say there are five factors to fico credit scores   payment history is adversely affected by late payments so always pay on time otherwise your report will be for seven years credit utilization has to do with how much of your available credit is currently in use lower is better but 0 is n't good either because they want to see that you 're using credit 10 or less is a good goal and try to keep any single card balance to 30 or less when its statement close date rolls around credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts cards or otherwise the older the better do n't close either of your other cards because that would cause your average account age to fall and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank 's website suggested taking out a loan it also has to do with the number of accounts overall i 've never found a satisfactory answer for what the sweet spot is but i suspect it 's in the 6 12 range you would n't want to get several new ones at the same time because new credit is affected by the credit inquiries hard pulls that occur when you apply for new cards or loans inquiries stay on your report for two years before falling off this is almost certainly where your score dropped you also mentioned not knowing if some hospital bills are still affecting your score you 'll want to review your credit reports and find out plus checking your credit reports regularly is a really great habit to get into because errors and fraud can and do happen there are three credit reporting agencies experian equifax and transunion and you 'll want to review all three you can get one free report from each of them every year it can take a couple of months for a new credit account to show up on your credit report so your score should recover and go even higher once that happens sit tight as annoying as that is

if you are allowed to do that then you have a lot of options mainly look at competitor offers and think about consumer utility    papa john 's is a bit different though because i see them as catering to middle class when really i think those people have dropped their consumption of papa john 's sort of goods so really papa john 's should be targeting the same demographic as pizza hut dominoes    however if they do compete in that sphere it is an open announcement of where they stand and i think papa john 's thinks too highly of themselves in that regard    imo offer something similar to costco take out pizza 9.99 for a x large supreme and that should do a bit however lower amount of toppings but same variety etc that 's pretty much what dominoes did with their large 3 topping carry out they just lowered the amount of toppings volume wise

others have covered the usual vehicles for getting money out of a property there 's another category of home loan called a hard money loan it would take a lot of inquiries to find a hard money loan given your needs but chances are its doable the terms can be onerous and hard money lenders do n't mess around when it comes to foreclosing after a few missed payments it 's an off the radar industry and the private lenders and specialized trustees operate together with strike force precision trustees normally should be trust able by borrower and lender but in the case i describe below one man owned the small company that lent and the small company that acted as trustee borrower beware yet if your credit score and income are dismal but your home equity is great hard money is the only way to borrow against your home in making hard money loans lenders do n't consider your credit score or income just how much equity is in the property i they hope you 'll default they do n't always hang onto the loans if you look like a payer instead of someone they can foreclose on they might sell the loan to someone who wants a stable monthly income you do n't know a thing about that person   a cautionary tale check out for a currently unfolding in which an elderly couple 's grandson convinced them to let him take title to their house borrow against it invest the proceeds and share the profits it did n't work that way he went through hard money lenders he borrowed $ and then $ 65,000 those were mysteriously paid off total mystery at this point and he borrowed $   about a year later he lost the house by defaulting the $ loan he was only about $ 2000 behind in payments when the trustee issued a notice of default followed by a notice of sale the trustee put the place up for auction which did n't require a court order that 's the way it is in california and many western states and a few others the hard money lender bought the loan at auction for $ and a home worth about $ 800,000 no longer belonged to the grandson   a fundraiser brought in about $ 120,000 and the couple bought a mobile home in a mobile home park the acre of land and swimming pool they used to own will be for sale soon or possibly for a mansion to be built house in the area go for about $ 2.5 m when improved with very large new houses i poke around when i see a house bought cheaply at a foreclosure auction quite often the former borrower had inherited the house treated it like a piggy bank defaulted and boom no more house it never makes sense to put a house at risk for a small amount like $ 5000 if you ca n't pay those credit card bills the lenders can you and maybe get a court order to extract something from your checking account every month but they ca n't take your belongings when you sign a deed of trust or mortgage you 're giving a third party the right to kick you out of your home and take possession of it you do n't have any say in the matter you might go to court and say whatever you feel like saying but if you owe many payments and ca n't pay them immediately you 're very likely to be out of luck someone mentioned paying off credit card balances with the highest interest rates first that 's done by throwing whatever cash you have at them while paying the minimum on the lower rate balances that 's financially sound but there 's a technique that turns out to be more motivating for some which is attacking the lowest balance first it leads to the quickest reduction in the number payments you 're required to make every month and quickly lets you add the money you were applying to the smallest balance to the payment you make on the next smallest balance close each card as you pay it off if you do n't want to accumulate debt again p.s. i do n't know what your home 's feed is so i did n't address that if it 's some kind of rental income every lender i have encountered credits 75 of the current monthly rent toward your gross income they assume there will be vacancies and other costs

the answer to your question has to do with the an explanation of shares authorized issued and outstanding companies in their articles of incorporation specify a maximum number of shares they are authorized to issue for example purposes let 's assume facebook is authorized to issue 100 shares let 's pretend they have actually issued 75 shares but only 50 are outstanding aka float i.e. freely trading stock in the market and stock options total 25 shares so if someone owns 1 share what percentage of facebook do they own you might think 1/100 or 1 you might think or 1.3 or you might think or 2   2 is the answer but only on a non diluted basis so today someone who owns 1 share owns 2 of facebook tomorrow facebook announces they just issued 15 shares to whatsapp to buy the company   now there are 65 shares outstanding and 90 issued now someone who owns 1 share of facebook own only or 1.5 down from 2 p.s. valuation can be thought of as the price of the stock at the time of the purchase announcement

newspapers write a lot about the central bank stopping cheap money in the us what is that exactly and what are the implications for the stock market an interest rate is simply defined as the price of money   so if money is cheap it must mean there is a low interest rate compared to normal   if milk is cheap we 're comparing it to past prices or prices at competitors stores   same with money i do n't think its fair to say just because the supply of dollars rises that the value of dollars will go down   value or price is determined by supply and demand not just supply   its possible for the demand for dollars to be stronger than the rising supply which would drive the price higher   a good example of this is to look at the value of the dollar recently   the fed has been printing $ 85 billion per month yet the value of them is going up compared to foreign currencies gold and just about everything   why because the fed has merely threatened to stop but it has n't stopped   that alone was enough to increase demand above supply   so if you want to know what will happen take a look at what is happening when cheap money ends the value of the dollar will go up interest rates will go up   this will be a drag on the economy   it will be more difficult for companies to show profits and earnings should decline   in addition those who have grown to the easy money and have over leveraged themselves ie reits could go bankrupt

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

interesting when you say diy you mean pencil and paper for most of us the choice came down to using a professional vs using the software   your second bullet really hits the point the tax return is a giant spreadsheet with multiple cells depending on each other short of building my own spreadsheet to perform the task i found the software at $ to be the happy medium between the full diy and the pro at $ 400 +   with a single w2 and no other items the form is likely just a and there should n't be any so long as you have the data you need pencil paper is fine   there 's no exact time to say go with the software except perhaps when you realize there are enough fields to fill out where the might be cumbersome or the need to see the exact tax bracket has value for you   you are clearly in the category that can fill out the one form at some point you might have investment income schedule d enough mortgage interest to itemize deductions schedule a etc you 'll know when it 's time to go the software route   keep in mind there are free online choices from each of the tax software providers good for simple returns up to a certain level thanks to phil for noting this in comments   i 'll offer an anecdote the distinction between using the software as a tool vs having a high knowledge of taxes i wrote an article the phantom tax zone in which i explained how the process of taxing social security benefits at a certain level created what i called a phantom tax rate i knew that $ 1000 more in income could cause $ 850 of the benefit to be taxed as well but with a number of factors to consider i wanted to create a chart to show the tax at each incremental $ 1000 of income added using the software i simply added $ 1000 noted the tax due and repeated doing this by hand would have taken a day not 30 minutes   for you the anecdote may have no value social security is too far off for others who in march are doing their return the process may hold value many people are deciding whether to make their ira deposit be pre tax or the post tax roth ira the software can help them quickly see the effect of + $ 1000 in income and choose the mix that 's ideal for them

not sure if i follow your question completely re what if some fraud takes place that 's too big even for it to fund    sipc does not fund anything what it does is takes over the troubled brokerage firm books assets and returns the money faster refer to sipc what sipc covers what it does not and more specifically sipc why we are not the fdic sipc is free for ordinary investors to get the same from elsewhere one has to pay the premium edit the event we are saying is a large brokrage firm takes all of the margin money from customer accounts and loses it and also sell off all the stocks actually shown as being held in customer account that would be to big while its not clear as to what exactly will happens my guess is that the limits per customers will go down as initial payments subsequent payments will only be done after recover of funds from the bankrupt firm what normally happens when a brokrage firm goes down is some of the money from customers account is diverted stocks are typically safe and not diverted hence the way sipc works is that it will give the money back to customer faster to individuals in absence of sipc individual investors would have had to fight for themselves

with 100 k i would dump the first 95 k into something lame like a tax advantaged bond or do as the others here suggested   my alternative would be to take the remaining 5 k and put into something leveraged   for instance 5 k would be more than enough to buy long term leaps options on the spy etf     time of post you could get 4 contracts on the dec 2017 leaps at the $ 225 strike roughly 10 out of the money for under $ 1200   possibly $ 1100 if you them 4 $ 1200 = $ 4800 at risk 4 $ = $ 90,000 = amount of spy stock you control with your $ 4800 if the market drops spy never reaches $ 225 in the next 3 years and you are out the $ 4800 but can use that to reduce capital gains and still have the $ 95 k on the sidelines earning $ 950 or so per year   basically you 'd be guaranteed to have $ 97 k in the bank after two years if the market goes up significantly before 2018 you 'll still have 95 k in the bank earning a measly 1 but you 've also got 4 contracts which are equal to $ 90 k shares of s&p 500   almost as if every single dollar was invested   bad news if spy goes up 20 or more from current levels over the next three years you 'll unfortunately have earned some taxable income   boo freaking

for an app that 's distributed on the internet at large which pretty much rules out mobile for a general audience but setting that aside your only protection is either a trust the company or b trust the community to have audited the source code a new startup should n't be trusted enough for a for b it 's not every individual user that needs to understand all the implications but an app that becomes semi popular would likely attract enough geeks who have audited the source code or tested the app in a sandbox to raise red flags if anything is awry hopefully anything truly nefarious would lead to an outcry the would scare away even a non technical user it 's certainly debatable whether this is realistic but it 's not far fetched   to be even remotely popular with a general audience though an app like this would need to be distributed through the walled garden app stores from apple google microsoft in that case users are trusting the gatekeeper to exclude an app that was discovered to be doing something malicious this provides some protection even if the source code is hidden

imo there are too many people expecting a correction for one to occur i hear both smart money and retail investors talking about raising cash for a correction that 's not usually when they occur in all actuality it should n't matter you should always invest expecting a correction the market could be another 20 higher before we get a correction or it could go down 10 and then another 10 from there if you ca n't weather the storms then stay out of the water

there is a problem with grouping them all as dismantling as many are and are wasteful   the epa itself can not get out of it 's own way     i worked on one project recently 2 years ago where we were designing a cooling tower huge ac for power plant for goose creek sc where we were going to add another tower so that they could eventually switch to a close loop system keeps all water in system no dumping in river   the city of goose creek went to court because the epa made a rule that by a certain date a company could no longer use an open system on a cooling tower if it dumped into a   the city got their wish and they won and the epa backed off and the town of goose creek gets to keep the dirty warm water that was is being dumped into the river so that the fishermen would have better catches no shit this is how it was and they wanted to keep it they did n't want to chance losing the warm waters that drew more fish   well jokes on the town as we are now building a tower in that location that will have an open system to dump into the river   here 's the catch before it was to be a tower where the water must be better quality as the media in the tower could foul and impact the thermal rating of the tower now they are going with a type tower and the media on those can accept the worst fucking water you can think of and still perform properly   so now the fishermen will get some nasty water that will be just below the allowable amount set by the epa so that some lazy people can catch fish easier   that is what i consider a wasteful government program   but that is just my opinion based on an interaction i had with a project where the epa stuck there big head where they did nt even know what they were doing

if this is n't a case where you would be willing to forgive the debt if they ca n't pay it 's a business transaction not a friend transaction establish exactly what the interest rate will be what the term of the loan is whether periodic payments are required how much is covered by those payments vs. being due at the end of the term as a balloon payment whether they can make additional payments to reduce the principal early get it all in writing and signed by all concerned before any money changes hands consider having a lawyer review the language before signing if the loan is large enough that it might incur gift taxes then you may want to go the extra distance to make it a real properly documented intra family loan to do this you must charge of at least pay taxes on at least a certain minimal interest rate and they have to make regular payments or you can gift them the payments but you still wo n't up paying tax on the interest income in this case you definitely want a lawyer to draw up the papers i think there are services on the web specialize in helping to set this up properly and which offer services such as bookkeeping and monthly billing at extra cost to make it less hassle for the lender if the loan will be structured as a mortgage on the borrower 's house making the interest deductible for the borrower in the us there are additional forms that need to be filled the services can help with that too for appropriate fees again this probably wants experts writing the agreement to make sure it 's properly written for where you and the borrower live caveat all the above is assuming usa rules may be very different elsewhere i 've done a formal mortgage mostly to avoid gift tax and it was n't too awful a hassle your mileage will vary

disclosure i am a real estate agent involved with houses to buy sell but much activity in rentals i got a call from a man and his wife looking for an apartment he introduced itself described what they were looking for and then suggested i google his name he said i 'd find that a few weeks back his house burned to the ground and he had no insurance he did n't have enough savings to rebuild and besides needing an apartment had a building lot to sell   insurance against theft may not be at the top of your list do n't keep any cash and keep your possessions to a minimum but a house needs insurance for a bank to give you a mortgage once paid off you have no legal obligation but are playing a dangerous game you are right it 's an odds game if the cost of insurance is .5 the house value and the chance of it burning down is 1 in 300 i made this up you are simply betting it wo n't be yours that burns down   given that for most people a paid off house is their largest asset more value that all other savings combined it 's a risk most would prefer not to take   life insurance is a different matter a person with no dependents has no need for insurance for those who are married or have a loved one or for parents insurance is intended to help survivors bridge the gap for that lost income the 10 20 times income value for insurance is just a recommendation whose need fades away as one approaches independence i do n't believe in insurance as an investment vehicle so this answer is talking strictly term

let me just add that while you do n't need to write the date received on the back of the check you could why let 's say someone was late in paying you and you wanted to document the fact that they were late i 've had late paying customers send me a check dated on the due date but really they just pre dated the check and sent it 60 days past due so let 's say i want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue when you deposit or cash a check an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history it used to be that the original physical cancelled check was returned to the payer but that was another era so write the date received on the back next to the endorsement endorse the check and take a photo of the front and back along with the postmark on the envelope to document that they are a late payer this way if it ever becomes a he said she said issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late if the payer looks at their check images they 'll see your received date note next to the endorsement granted this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation in 20 + years of running a business i 've actually had the foresight to do this a handful of times with offenders and in only one case did it come in handy later on but boy was i glad to have those photos when i needed them

edit quid identified the reverse split in may 2017   in a reverse split your shares are worth 7 times as much per share but you have the amount of shares   a share worth $ now was worth all else being equal $ a month ago    so a call with a $ 2.50 strike a month ago was well out of the money and would now be the equivalent of a call with a $ strike   a $ call with a $ underlying or a $ 2.50 call with a $ underlying would reasonably be worth only 5 cents so i now suspect that the quote is a stale quote that existed pre split and has n't been adjusted by the provider old answer i can find no valid reason why those calls would be so cheap   the stock price has been trending down from its onset in 2000 so either no one expects it to be above $ 2.50 in a month or it 's so illiquid that there 's not any real data to evaluate the options   they did pay some massive 30 dividends in 2010 and 2012 they 've been cash for the past 4 years at least and i have found at least on strong sell rating so there 's not much to be optimistic about   nasdaq does not list any options for the stock so it must be an otc trade    with an ask size of 10 you could buy calls on 1,000 shares for $ 0.05 so if you can afford to lose $ 50 and want to take a flyer you can give it a shot but i suspect it 's not a valid quote and is something that 's been manufactured by the option broker

the biggest benefit to having a larger portfolio is relatively reduced transaction costs if you buy a $ share of google at a broker with a $ 10 commission the commission is 1.2 of your buy price   if you then sell it for $ that 's another 1.1 gone to commission   another way to look at it is of your $ 30 $ $ gain you 've given up $ 20 to transaction costs or of the proceeds of your trade went to transaction costs now assume you traded 10 shares of google your buy was $ and you sold for $   your gain is $ 300 and you spent the same $ 20 to transact the buy and sell   now you 've only given up 6 of your proceeds $ 20 divided by your $ 300 gain you could also scale this up to 100 shares or even 1,000 shares generally dividend reinvestment are done with no transaction cost   so you periodically get to bolster your position without losing more to transaction costs   for retail investors transaction costs can be meaningful   when you 're a $ 5,000,000 pot of money you can make your trades on a larger scale giving up relatively less to transaction costs

you mention early exercise in your title but you seem to misunderstand what early exercise really means some companies offer stock options that vest over a number of years but which can be exercised before they are vested that is early exercise you have vested stock options so early exercise is not relevant it may or may not be the case that your stock options could have been early exercised before they vested but regardless you did n't exercise them so the point is moot as littleadv said 83(b election is for restricted stocks often from exercising unvested stock options your options are already vested so they wo n't be restricted stock so 83(b election is not relevant for you a taxable event happen when you exercise the point of the 83(b election is that exercising unvested stock options is not a taxable event so 83(b election allows you to force it to be a taxable event but for you with vested stock options there is no need to do this you mention that you want it not to be taxable upon exercise but that 's what incentive stock options isos are for isos were designed for the purpose of not being taxable for regular income tax purposes when you exercise although it is still taxable upon exercise for amt purposes and it is only taxed when you sell however you have non qualified stock options were you given the option to get isos at the beginning why did your company give you i do n't know the specifics of your situation but since you mentioned early exercise and 83(b elections i have a hypothesis as to what might have happened for people who early exercise for plans that allow early exercise there is a slight advantage to having compared to isos this is because if you early exercise immediately upon grant and do 83(b election you pay no taxes upon exercise because the difference between strike price and fmv is 0 and there are no taxes upon vesting for regular or amt and if you hold it for at least 1 year upon sale it will be long term capital gains on the other hand for isos it 's the same except that for long term capital gains you have to hold it 2 years after grant and 1 year after exercise so the period for long term capital gains is longer so companies that allow early exercise will often offer employees either or isos where you would choose if you intend to early exercise or iso otherwise if hypothetically that 's what happened then you chose wrong because you got and did n't early exercise

it depends on how much diversification you think you need and what your mutual fund options are for instance picking an index fund already provides a fair amount of diversification especially if you select a total market type of index readily available from fidelity and vanguard and many other fund families are you looking to balance domestic vs. international investments you may want to add an international index fund to the mix feel that a particular sector has tremendous potential add a sector fund this investment mix is up to you or your investment advisor however depending on your roth ira mutual fund choices some of these funds may have minimum investment requirement $ 3k to open a fund 's account for instance in that case you 'd have no choice but to put your entire investment into one fund and wait for subsequent years where you 'd be able to invest in other funds after providing additional contributions and/or any growth from your initial investment one thing to look at is whether you have an option of putting some of your contributions into a money market account within the roth ira you can then reallocate funds from that account into another fund after you can meet the minimum investment requirement however in my opinion if you start out by investing in a solid low cost index fund from a reputable mutual fund company you 've already picked up most of the diversification you need a single fund is enough

nobody here really answered your question   the custodian of the 401k determines what funds and investment options are available within that 401k   so if they 're eliminating company stock as an option then they can absolutely make you sell out of it     you may be able to do an in service rollover and transfer your funds to an individual ira but that 's not particularly common among 401k administrators    aside from that i 'd ask why do you want to hold company stock anyway   generally i 'd advise against this as its imposing a ton of risk on your financial future   if your company tanks you 're out of a job which sucks   but it sucks even more if your company tanks and your 401k loses a ton of value at the same time    edit i see you asked who benefits as well   it may just be a situation of no benefit at all   perhaps the plan did n't have enough people investing in company stock to make the option cost effective   maybe the administrator decided that allowing people to take on that amount of risk was not in their best 's not   could be a ton of reasons but it 's unlikely the company did so out of greed   there is n't a lot of financial benefit for them there

first ianal this is going to depend on the kind of points if it 's an internal point system that the business is doing on their own then they may very well give you that many extra points they may really not care specially if the cost of the points is low enough remember that steak dinner that you paid $ 60 for only really cost them $ 2 and that they use $ 60 worth of points on it   if the point system is tied to a bank or credit card then it 's far more likely that the just use them is not the proper answer the company doing the reimbursing is giving the location $ 60 and using your points the points have a much higher value   with that said your responsibility is to notify and follow their rules so notify them in writing and use the rewards card as you normally would if your being honest then the worst that happens is that your point balance is a little negative because you spent 100 points but really only had 98 after adjustment   most likely if your being honest they will just eat the few points over that you went on accident   if you get an answer in writing to just keep the points then i guess you know where your daughter 's wedding reception will be let 's hope it 's a place of course as a good person or maybe a stupid person i should call them wait 30 minutes in the queue and then try to explain the issue to the service desk i actually did that and the guy thought i am nuts to even call and told me to just use them they are yours now i do n't feel like calling again and again until i get someone that believes it just to return them their points you will want to do this in writing email will work but you really want a paper trail either way i could just toss the card and forget about it however i had quite some points on it that really belong to me so that feels like i pay for their fault there is no need to do this it 's like a bank error talk to them and they will give you an answer in the mean time do your best to only use the points you actually have use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right probably nobody will ever care let 's keep religious considerations out here what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day in the far future i understand this borders on a legal question nope do n't do this if you play dumb and spend 5000 points when you know you only have around 100 best case scenario you end up with points effectively canceling the benefit of the card you may also be banned form the program the location the network etc worst case scenario they want the monetary value of the points and sue you for it and the legal fees it may even be considered fraud   tl;dr use your card but be honest and handle the mistake in writing

makes total sense my main concern is what the worldwide speech monopolies twitter facebook youtube google reddit do with their power i 'm not concerned with the likes of i am concerned when there are no alternatives and no competition monopoly the speech companies decide what gets seen and who can speak and they 're often of the same political bent because they have similar global aims meaning they do n't care about the first amendment as long as they make $ $ and satisfy the demands of    if some blue twenty something or some bot decides they do n't like one of my sentences they can effectively exercise their power and cut me off from the entire world to some non insignificant extent for life sure you could jump to some thriving platform that does n't exist and talk to a handful of people but that 's quite the restriction considering you previously had access to millions of voices with twitter    youtube trending is a good exercise in how brainwashing works it 's the same people every time with their opinions and seth myers and is actually famous so i get why he 's trending somewhat but daily and seth myers do people even watch his show or does someone at google simply want us to see his rants every single day i 'd bet on the latter

i 'm all in on hard silver a small portion is stored at my house for emergency expenditures and the vast majority is in a high security vault in canada that was actually the cheapest place i could find for long term storage and insurance which happened to be off shore it could turn out to be beneficial to be off shore though in the 1930s gold became illegal to privately own its very possible they could do the same this time although they did n't in 1979 oil is too high in volume to reasonably store gold is n't as undervalued as silver which i could spend a full day talking about but to sum it up in a few points there is less silver than there is gold gold has a premium for jewelry which will likely go down in a crash even though you will still see gains silver is the second most used commodity besides oil less people are in the know about it silver prices were actually higher than gold a few times in the past century simply measuring the dow in silver will show it 's further below the historical average compared to gold i 'll stop there but i could go on though on silver if people want real estate is still very expensive from the 2008 recession traditionally mortgages are $ 1.05 per dollar you would spend on renting the same property currently real estate is at like $ 1.25 + i believe it peaked at about $ i rent to save money which you can spend on other assets   if one 's willing to move to another state for lower taxes they definitely should employment is going to be harder to come by and they should get as much out of it as possible as they can if they do n't save enough they could end up just using their entire savings during the whole thing if they ca n't find a job in which case at the end you 'd never know they knew it was going to happen   overall i do n't think this crash is going to be like the great depression i do n't feel compelled to store food and buy a generator or anything i believe the living will be easier than it were to live in the 90s for those who are invested in assets everything is going to be on sale meanwhile their wealth will be increasing depending on how much they own it could be increasing faster than they need to spend it sounds like the life to me but with that said those without real assets especially the lower class will be unemployed and living on food stamps perhaps even the food stamps making more people leave the dollar and the economy this actually might not be a prediction and is what happening already but i do n't believe anybody in america at least will be starving in the 30s we had not mastered industry farming yet and we had the to make things worse    crime though i 'd own a gun the protesters are here already and i think we are just passing the half way point right now they will get   i do n't know enough about taxes to know the best country or place to store to combat taxes maybe someone else can chime in i 'm in canada to avoid high insurance and storage fees   and for careful selection of primary residence in the long haul i 'd rent a small apartment as small and cheap as possible in a safe neighborhood but not so much that a single grocery store or gas station going out of business could ruin it

given that a poor person probably has much less to invest how can odds be in their favor to add to lan 's great answer if one is poor because they do n't have enough income to build wealth invest then there are only two ways to change the situation earn more or spend less   neither are easy but both are usually possible   one can take on side jobs look for a better paying career etc   cutting spending can also be hard but is generally easier than adding income in general wealth building is more about what you do with your income than about how much you make   obviously the more you make the easier it is but just about anyone can build wealth if they spend less than they make once your net income is high enough that you have income then you can start building wealth   unfortunately many people have piles of debts to clean up before they are able to get to that point what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor anymore right just having $ 100 is not going to make you rich there is a practical limit to how much return you can make short of high risk activities like gambling lottery tickets etc i have actually seen this as a justification for playing the lottery which i disagree with but is an interesting point   if you just invest $ 100 at 25 per year for illustration traditional investments typically only make 10 12 on average in 10 years you 'll have about $ if instead you invest $ 100 per month at 12 annualized in 10 years you 'll have over $ 23,000 not that $ 23,000 makes you rich the point is that regularly saving money is much more powerful than having money to start with

yes it 's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier you can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees you may or may not want an overdraft account for example or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards when i started my business i opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going eventually when i wanted to establish a business line of credit it was easier to set up because i they were already familiar with my business its revenue and needs for a line of credit you can set up a solo 401k with your bank too and they 'll be very happy to do so but i recommend shopping around for options i 've found that the dedicated investment firms schwab fidelity etc tend to have better options fees and features for investment accounts just because a specific bank handles your checking account does n't mean you need to use that bank for everything lastly i use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business maybe i 'm paranoid but i just do n't want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket just something to consider i do n't really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks but it helps me sleep

i believe that your dilemma comes from not having clearly defined consequences of buying it on one side you want it and you can afford it but on the other side there is nothing solid just some vague dislike of spending money and guilt of buying something useless you 're basically guilt tripping yourself into not buying it and guilt tripping is always bad what you need is clear cut consequence something like i can buy x but then i wo n't get y and z and for that you need a clearly laid out budget just to know how much you can spend money that go into things that are absolutely required money that go into various saving plans etc and after that you 're left with some clear amount that should be spent on making yourself happier making yourself happier is not something you should feel guilty about it 's actually one of purposes of life making yourself happy is only bad if it 's hurting other areas of your life and even that is relative because there is always some extent of degradation you 're willing to accept or you have already accepted there is absolutely no point in saving every single penny you can because that will make you live long and unhappy life and die without enjoying your riches

gambling is never a wise investment even assuming that the stated odds are correct there can be multiple winners and the jackpot is shared between the winners so the individual payout can be significantly less than the total jackpot if i were to take a dollar from you and a dollar from your buddy on the promise that i 'd give the two of you a total of $ 3 back if you both guessed the result of a single fair coin toss would you take the offer note also that the jackpot value is quite misleading it 's the sum of the annual payments and if you reduce that to present value it 's significantly less

well the largest in terms of both volume and unfortunately contact size is the options on the s&p futures index it 's based on one contract which is $ 250 times the current s&p index or just over $ 300 k current value this does not make for too cheap an option cost but it 's definitely the largest as you requested   for the average joe or ray in this case the most popular etfs are spy and dia for the s&p and dow jones respectively these are reasonably sized so their options are within range of your goal see the spy options at yahoo then flip over to the dia options   spy reflects 1/10 the s&p so an option contract on 100 spy shares is effectively on 10 times the s&p index or the futures option pricing

like any share valuing facebook requires a projection of earnings and earnings growth to arrive at a present value for the right to share in these future earnings    there are economic arguments to be had for facebook to see either a negative or positive future long term net income growth given the uncertainty we can establish a very rough baseline value by treating it as a perpetuity zero growth discounted at historical equity growth rate 8 with some very simple math an annual net income of 900 million discounted at 8 percent in perpetuity is worth billion   now take into account the fact that tech stocks trade at an inflated pe multiple of around 3 times that of a mature company in an established industry pe 20 for average stocks and anywhere between 60 + for tech stocks and i would expect the market cap for this perpetuity to be around 34 billion   a market cap of 34 billion is a share value of around 15.5 which is the point where i would take up a long position with fair confidence i do think that the share deserves a premium for potential income growth despite the current and potential future revenue losses simply due to the incredibly large user base and the potential to monetize this of course it was n't worth the 22 dollar premium that ipo buyers paid but its worth something   i think there is simply too much uncertainty for me to go long in the next 6 months unless it hits which may never happen if the company can monetize mobile and show quarterly results in the next year i would consider a long position for anywhere from 15 20 a share

one rule of thumb is that having regular activity on at least three different revolving accounts will improve your score i agree that it may not be a great idea to have too many open credit accounts trade lines reporting on your credit report but if you do n’t have enough active accounts it will   prevent you from being approved for a home mortgage both conventional fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage loans and government loans such as fha and va require that you have a minimum number of reporting trade lines that are active or have been active within the most recent 24 month period of time an example of meeting the mortgage loan requirement is having a revolving account credit card that has been reporting activity for the past 24 months plus 2 other trade lines that have had activity reported for 12 months each both within the past 24 months
