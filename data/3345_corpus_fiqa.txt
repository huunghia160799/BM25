i 've been taking all the cheap fixed rate debt banks would like to give me lately what rate in practice i find the only way i get a low enough rate on a term fixed rate loan is to use collateral that is auto loans and home loans i have n't seen any personal loans with a low enough fixed rate student loans may be cheap enough if they 're subsidized i guess here 's how i think of the rate if you look at the average annual return on 80 bonds 20 stocks is 6.7 with worst year that 's a nominal return not a real return if you subtract taxes say your marginal rate the rate you pay on your last dollar of income is 28 federal plus 5 state then if you have no tax deferral the 6.7 becomes about a 4.5 average with reasonably wide variation year by year you can mess with this e.g. using tax exempt bonds and tax efficient stock funds etc which would be wise but for deciding whether to take out debt getting too detailed is false precision the 6.7 number is only an average to begin with not a guarantee say you pay 4.5 on a loan and you keep your money in very conservative investments that 's probably at least going to break even if you give it some years it certainly can and sometimes will fail to break even over some time periods but the risk of outright catastrophe is low if your annual loss is 10 that sucks but it should not ruin your life in practice i got a home loan for close to 4.5 which is tax deductible so a lower effective rate and got an auto loan subsidized by the manufacturer for under 3 both are long term fixed rate loans with collateral so i was happy to borrow this money paying about a 3 effective rate in both cases well below my rough threshold of 4.5 i do not however run a credit card balance even though one of my cards is only 7 right now 7 is too high and it 's a floating rate that could rise the personal loans i 've seen have too high rates also thoughts overall i think using debt as a tool requires that you 're already financially stable such that the debt is n't creating a risky situation the debt should be used to increase liquidity and flexibility and perhaps boost investment returns a bit where you 're likely to get into trouble is using debt to increase your purchasing power especially if you use debt to buy things that are n't necessary for me the primary reason to use debt is flexibility and liquidity and the secondary bonus reason is a possible spread between the debt rate and investment returns

is a high value realtime settlement system across europe and for this to be open on weekends would mean all the banks including central banks in the euro zone work quite a few times to manage intra day liquidity banks borrow from each other hence there is an active of the liquidity by banks the borrowing happens over phone and fax and the lending bank sending a high value transaction that credits the borrowing banks these is the day to day job of treasury group highly paid individuals to manage liquidity now if on weekends the volume is less it does not make sense to keep these people the cost of supporting this for very business gain is not driving to build such systems   on the other hand on retail transactions say cards debit credit atm the value is not high and hence there is no treasury function involved and there is a huge need everything is automated so no issues

banks are currently a lot less open to creative financing than they were a few years ago but you may still be able to take advantage of the tactic of splitting the loan into two parts a smaller second mortgage sometimes called a purchase money second at a slightly higher interest rate for around 15 20 of the value and the remaining in a conventional mortgage   since this tactic has been around for a long time it 's not quite in the category of the they were pulling a few years back so has a lot more potential to still be an option   i did this in for my first house in 93 and again in 99 when i moved to a larger home after getting married   it allowed me to get into both houses with less than 20 down and not pay pmi this way neither loan is above 80 so you do n't have to pay pmi   the interest on the second loan will be higher but usually only a few percent and is thus usually a fraction of what you were paying for the pmi and it 's deductible from your taxes if you 've been making your payments on time and have a good credit rating then you might be able to find someone who would offer you such a deal   you might even be able to get a rate for your primary that is down in the low 4 's depending on where rates are today and what your credit rating is like    if you can get the main loan low enough even if the other is like say 7 your blended rate may still be right around 5 if you can find a deal like this it 's also great material to use to negotiate with your current lender either help me get the pmi off this loan or i 'm going to refinance   then you can compare what they will offer you with what you can get in a refinance and decide what makes the most sense for you   on word of warning when refinancing do not get sucked into an adjustable rate mortgage   if you are finding life tight right now with house payments and all the an arm could be highly since they often offer a very low initial rate however then invariably adjust upwards and you could suddenly find yourself with a monster payment far larger than what you have now   with low rates where they are getting a conventional fixed rate loan or loans in the case of the tactic being discussed here is the way to go

my point was that we have the safest debt for right i agree that we can still afford to spend money to fix the economy the problem is that the spending we have been doing so far is n't doing a whole lot considering what we are investing we have spent trillions and our gdp growth rate is two thirds what it was over the last 70 years if we were still at the beginning of the recovery that could be acceptable but it 's been three and a half years now we are going to need to start getting some bang for our buck to turn this around   if we are still doing the same thing two years from now investors may not have faith in the safety of the united states anymore they will realize we have taken on 30 years of deficits and then taken trillions more to save the economy if we are still stagnant the world will start to question how great our economy really is and whether we even deserve the world reserve currency   so yes i agree that we currently have the safest debt in the world and can try to save our economy through deficit spending i did off on a tangent but i think it was a necessary point we need to make sure that the deficit spending we do from here on in actually creates real value for the economy and gets real gdp growth    the reason i am sick of the argument is that many people seem to have this idea that the u.s. will always have the reserve currency and the world will always consider it to be the safest debt we can keep going this way for now but if we do n't back up that claim then sooner or later they wo n't buy it anymore i agree with the government spending but we need to spend in areas that are going to generate real gdp growth rather than randomly building projects and hoping for the best   edit so in other words i think i agree with you i just want to make sure people understand how things can get in the future and we do n't all buy into a sense of entitlement that we can spend whatever we want forever

it is certainly legal to transfer money between people no matter how often as long as the money is not originally from illegal sources if you are gaining in the process you need to pay taxes on your net gain as on any income but as always taxed income is still income consider the accumulating transaction cost the inherent risk of your friend keeping the money and the risk of the exchange rate going the other way but otherwise it is a simple arbitrage business there are thousands of people who do that all year long at stock exchanges and money markets you might be able to do it more efficient there and you do n't need a friend on the other side for that

the process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock or going short   when you use money to buy shares it is called going long in general your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything   let 's look at your two scenarios to see why when you start loot is trading at $ 20 per share   you purchased 100 shares for $ 2000 and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $ 2000   you are both long and short in the stock for $ 2000   at this point you have invested $ 2000 and you got your $ 2000 back from the short proceeds   you own and owe 100 shares under scenario a the price goes up to $ 30 per share   your long shares have gone up in value by $ 1000   however you have lost $ 1000 on your short shares   your short is called and you return your 100 shares and have to pay interest   under this scenario after it is all done you have lost whatever the interest charges are under scenario b the prices goes down to $ 10 per share   your long shares have lost $ 1000 in value   however your short has gained $ 1000 in value because you can buy the 100 shares for only $ 1000 and return them and you are left with the $ 1000 out of the $ 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares   however because your long shares have lost $ 1000 you still have n't gained anything   here again you have lost whatever the interest charges are as explained in the traders exclusive article that posted in the comments there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time   however this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short term time frame but up in the long term time frame   the investor might buy and hold for the long term but go short for a brief time while holding the long position however that is not what you are suggesting   your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time   you are only attempting to hedge your bets   and it does n't work   a long position and a short position are opposites to each other and no matter which way the stock moves you 'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position   and you 'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time with your comment you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term but you also believe that the stock is at a short term peak and will drop in the near future   this however does n't really change things much   let 's look again at your possible scenarios you believe that the stock is a long term buy but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short term   under scenario a you were incorrect about your short term guess   and although you might have been correct about the long term prospects you have missed this gain   you are out the interest charges and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term you 'll need to buy back in at a higher price under scenario b it turns out that you were correct about the short term drop   you pocket some cash but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon   your investment has lost value and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short   however it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position     and this is a shame since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up   you are your long term gains for a chance at a small short term gain

i 'd be curious to compare current rent with what your overhead would be with a house most single people would view your current arrangement as ideal when those about to graduate college ask for money advice i offer that they should start by living as though they are still in college share a house or apartment and sack away the difference if you really want to buy and i 'd assume for this answer that you feel the housing market in your area has passes its bottom i 'd suggest you run the numbers and see if you can buy the house 100 yours but then rent out one or two rooms you do n't share your mortgage details just charge a fair price when the stars line up just right these deals cost you the down payment but the roommates pay the mortgage   i discourage the buying by two or more for the reasons mrchrister listed

if you are planning this as a tax avoidance scheme well it is not the gains will be taxable in your hands and not in the banks hands banks simply do n't cash out the stock at the same price there will be quite a bit of both lawyers and others so in the end you will end up paying more the link indicates that one would pay back the loan via one 's own earnings so if you have a stock worth usd 100 you can pledge this to a bank and get a max loan of usd 50 there are regulations that govern the max you can get against 100 you want to buy something worth usd 50 sell half the stock get usd 50 pay the gains tax on usd 50 pledge the usd 100 stock to bank get a loan of usd 50 as you have not sold anything there is no tax over a period pay the usd 50 loan via your own earnings a high valued customer may be able to get away with a very low rate of intrest and very long repayment period    the tax implication to your legal hier would be from the time the stock come to his her hands to the time she sold so if the price increase to 150 by the time mark dies and its sold at 160 later the gain is only of usd 10 so rather than paying 30 or whatever the applicable tax rate it would be wise to pay an interest of few percentages

let me answer by parts when a company gives dividends the share price drops by the dividend amount   not always by that exact amount for many different reasons e.g. there are transaction costs if you reinvest dividend taxes etc i have tested that empirically now if all the shareholders choose to reinvest their dividends will the share price go back up to what it was prior to the dividend that is an interesting question the final theoretical price of the company does not need to be that when a company distributes dividends its liquidity diminish there is an impact on the balance sheet of the company if all investors go to the secondary market and reinvest the dividends in the shares that does not restore the cash in the balance sheet of the company hence the theoretical real value of the company is different before the dividends of course in practice there is not such a thing as one theoretical value in reality if everybody reinvest the dividend that will put upward pressure over the price of the company and depending on the depth of the offers meaning how many orders will counterbalance the upward pressure at the moment the final price will be determined which can be higher or lower than before not necessarily equal i ask because some like spy automatically reinvest dividends so what is the effect of this reinvestment on the stock price let us see the mechanics of these purchases when a non distributing etf receives cash from the dividends of the companies it takes that cash and reinvest it in the whole basket of stocks that compose the index not just in the companies that provided the dividends the net effect of that is a small leverage effect let us say you bought one unit of spy and during the whole year the shares pay 2 of dividends that are reinvested at the end of that year it will be equivalent to having 1.02 units of spy

interesting read i 'm not trying to get political with this post but it 's something that i found genuinely interesting while reading this article    my dad is an accountant for a large corporation and described tax law as 15 white 15 black and 70 gray i 'm sure that cat is n't the only company that is trying to avoid paying us corporate tax rates regardless of where it falls on the legality or white gray black spectrum this case may be somewhat of an outlier in that it 's pretty clear there was some shady tax avoidance and the tax sum is large $ yet i could n't help but feel that the amount of government intervention lawyer court fees whistle blower payout not to mention company productivity loss from the avoidance cleanup etc puts a on the expected value of this case for the general american citizen or tax payer   which leads me to my point there was some talk recently about the corporate tax rate being dropped down to 15 i 'm someone who generally leans left on issues but are there legitimate benefits to this it seems that large corporations simply employ huge teams of accountants to game the tax code and never end up paying anything close to the 30 would reducing the rate eliminate a lot of this tax avoidance behavior and result in more system efficiency while the government returns roughly equal sums of tax revenue from corporations it would obviously be beneficial to smaller businesses that ca n't afford the legal means necessary to pay lower rates as well    from a progressive standpoint my worry with dropping the rate is that companies would still find ways to simply squeeze more and more profit for the bottom line it 'd be interesting to find a way to leverage reducing the tax rate on large corporations by somehow tying it to increased pay and benefits to workers i 'm not sure of the proper implementation but letting corporations keep more of their money without the hassle of setting up 70 shell companies and incentivizing them to re invest in workers r&amp;d etc makes more sense than companies never paying 30 and even when caught for illegal acts being tied up in court for 10 years    i 'll end here because i 'm beginning to ramble a bit but the article was interesting for viewing corporate taxation on a system wide level

you might find some of the answers here helpful the question is different but has some similar concerns such as a changing economic environment what approach should i take to best protect my wealth against currency    devaluation poor growth prospects i want to avoid selling off any    more of my local index funds in a panic as i want to hold long term    does my portfolio balance make sense good question i ca n't even get us banks to answer questions like this such as what happens if they try to nationalize all bank accounts like in the soviet union   response it 'll never happen the question was what if i think that your portfolio carries a lot of risk but also offsets what you 're worried about   outside of government confiscation of foreign accounts if your foreign investments are held through a local brokerage you should be good   what to do about government confiscation   even the us government in 1933 confiscated physical gold and they made it illegal to own so even physical resources can be confiscated during hard times quite a large portion of my foreign investments have been bought at an    expensive time when our currency is already around historic lows    which does concern me in the event that it strengthens in future what    strategy should i take in the future if when my local currency starts    the strengthen do i hold my foreign investments through it and just    trust in cost averaging long term or try sell them off to avoid the    devaluation are these foreign investments a hedge   if so then you should n't worry if your currency does strengthen they serve the purpose of hedging the local environment   if these investments are not a hedge then timing will matter and you 'll want to sell and buy your currency before it does strengthen   the risk on this latter point is that your timing will be wrong

while you have found a way to possibly gain $ in tax free income you are also risking $ if you end up not using the money you contributed you will have to find a way to have that much in medical expenses by your retirement date or you will leave some money in the flexible spending account there are risks you take with these accounts use it or lose it and risks the company takes leave with a deficit in the account many times we get questions about how to spend all that the employee contributed before the last day of work or the end of the plan year   you can play it more fair by selecting the maximum amount per check to be taken from your pay check then waiting until the retirement date to decide how much you will withdraw from the fsa your last day of work is your last day to incur a medical expense but you are given a window to submit your claims that extends beyond your last day of work   i have not personally heard of an employer requiring a former employee to pay back the money when there is a   deficit in their fsa   remember people are fired or laid off with little or no warning trapping their money in a fsa the fact that you have the ability to plan for this event and considered your options is a great position to be in

that oil is traded in usd makes for extra demand and thus a stronger dollar with more purchasing power it 's not really economics that are the issue though many might argue a weakened dollar might help the us economy cheaper exports   the real issue is power these gold backed securities make it so that certain countries can get around us sanctions   not to mention that controlling the currency that oil is traded in means the us can devalue their currency to gain an advantage in the event of a shortage   also because petroleum is traded in dollars this means treasury bonds are a natural place to store wealth for oil producers high demand for these bonds makes it cheap for the us government to borrow and easier to make interest payments thus making t bonds a safe asset

they 've been around long enough now for there to be past performance figures you can google for i think you 'll find the results are n't very encouraging i personally do n't think there 's a huge risk that the robots will lose all your money but there 's every reason to expect they are n't likely to perform better than traditional managers or beat the market at the end of the day the robots are employing a lot of analysis and management techniques that traditional managers have been using and since traditional managers use computers to do it efficiently there 's not much gain imo yes in theory labour is expensive so cutting it out is good but in practise in this case the amount of money being managed is huge and the human cost is pretty insignificant i personally do n't believe that the reduced fees represent the cost of the human management i think it 's just marketing there might be some risk that the robots can be gamed but i doubt the potential is very great your return might in theory be a fraction of a percent less over time because it 's going on the problem here is that the algorithms are functionally broadly known no doubt every robo adviser has its own algorithms that in theory are the closely guarded secret but in reality a broad swath of the functional behaviour will be understood by many people in the right circles and that gives rise to predictability and if you can predict investment trading patterns you can make money from those patterns that means humans making money taking margin away from the robots or robots making money from other robots that are behind the curve if robo advisers continue to take off i would expect them to under perform more and more

of course its possible under what terms and with what fees depends on your bank country regulations but generally speaking loaning is the major source of income for banks especially short term account overdrafts which is essentially a loan usually at a high rate in the us you can now since the new regulations kicked in instruct the bank not to pay checks decline debit card purchases if you do n't have sufficient funds on the account otherwise you can instruct them to pay at their discretion to avoid bouncing checks and accept nsf fees usually pretty high some banks provide overdraft lines of credit then you wo n't have nsf fees and will just pay interest when tapping into that line others provide option to automatically withdraw the missing amount from a linked account checking or credit card

the bank wo n't let you because differences in required account features business accounts have different features many of them legal features that are required by businesses for instances do you want to be able to deposit cheques that are written out to your business name you need a business account for that your business could be sold then it would n't be your business so it would n't make sense to put the business account under your personal name the bank account and the cash it holds is a business asset and should be owned by the business so when the business is sold the account goes with it this is especially the case for a corporation that has shareholders and not a sole proprietorship for a business you could also in theory assign other people as signing authorities on the business account e.g. your corporate treasurer and the individuals performing that role could change over time business accounts allow for this kind of use market segmentation the bank has consciously undertaken to segment their product offerings in order to maximize their profit market segmentation helps the bottom line even if there were zero legal reasons to have separate personal vs. business accounts banks would still make it their policy to sell different account types according to use because they can make more money that way consider an example in another industry the plain old telephone company also practices segmentation personal business do you want a telephone line for a business and listed as such in the phone book you need a business line do you want a phone line hooked up at a non residential address you need a business line here it 's clear it is less of a legal issue than with the bank account and it does n't matter that the technical features of the phone line may be identical for the basic product offerings within each segment the phone company has chosen to segment and price their product offerings this way q. why do companies choose to charge some kinds of customers more than others for essentially the same underlying service a. because they can

i do n't see how it 's that weird if you have $ 40 worth of stock or $ 40 in cash it 's essentially the same thing when measuring your wealth the difference it that assets like stocks have more volatility in their value most the time    as for bill gates it 's hard to hide too much wealth if you hide money in your mattress and do n't spend it it 's really not useful as money that 's an over simplification but you see my point

but it also ca n't be because that would imply that a 30y us treasury bond only yields 2.78 which is low the rates are displayed as of today as the footnote suggests these are to be read with maturities a treasury with 1 year maturity is at and a treasury with 30y maturity is at 2.78 generally bonds with longer maturity terms give better yields than bonds of shorter duration this indicates the belief that in long term the outlook is positive

new york city is high cost of living and i have absolutely no clue why people live there   it 's a tough place and the taxes are oppressive   people buy a studio apartment for $ 150,000 that has 175 square feet that 's not a typo plus a $ maintenance fee that continues after the mortgage is paid off   and that 's just what the fee is now our rental house which used to be our primary residence at 1,300 square feet has a 15-year mortgage payment of about $ 800 and $ 1,000 per year in property taxes   and my area is n't particularly low cost of living high cost of living is just that   more money flies out the door just for the privilege of living there   you make good investments with real estate by buying property at a good price in a good location   those deals are everywhere but in high col locations you 're probably more susceptible to price fluctuations which will trap you in your property if your mortgage goes underwater anyway that 's a long way of saying that i do n't buy your recommendation to get property in high col areas   there are desirable low col places to live too

you sound like you 're well educated well spoken and so i 'm going to assume that you are somewhere in the neighborhood of top 5 material that means you can pretty much do anything you want to if you put enough effort into it there are two types of people in this world those who run the world and those who live comfortably in it and of course everyone else but they are irrelevant to the discussion who do you want to be i 've been around a lot of wildly successful people and they have two consistent traits   connections and freedom first everyone always told me that it 's not what you know it 's who you know but i never appreciated it until after college the world runs on connections   the more connections you have and the more successful they are the more successful you will be second the more freedom you have the more opportunity you will have to take chances which is how you become wildly successful freedom comes from not being in debt first and having money second why do you think harvard grads are the guys that end up having so much money and power it 's probably because they grew up in a rich family which provided them money freedom and a wide social circle of rich people connections so you 're not rich   what to do well the easiest way to get into that group is to go to college with them and that means you need to get into harvard or another ivy league stanford if you want to be an engineer college will be where you will make your most intense and long lasting friendships   that roommate at harvard that you went on the crazy four day road trip with may someday be ceo of a company and when he needs a cio you can be damn sure you 'll be at the top of the list if you 're qualified but harvard costs a lot of money which means you 'll be in debt a lot when you get out of college you 'll have lots of rich important but you 'll be deeply in debt no freedom most of these type of people end up becoming consultants at big firms because they pay well    you 'll live a comfortable life and pay off your student loans in five or 10 years    then you 'll continue to live comfortably   but at that point you 'll be too old to take huge chances and too comfortable to change things or perhaps you 'll have a big mortgage =   no freedom with a heavy debt load it 's almost impossible to say join an early stage startup and really be able to take huge chances   you can do it maybe   or as an alternate option you can do what i did go to a cheap state school and graduate with no debt that puts you on the other side of the fence   freedom but no connections   then in order to be successful you have to figure out how to get connections goldman sachs wo n't hire you and everyone you meet is going to automatically assume you 're mediocre because of where you went to college at this point your only option is to take big chances move to new york or san francisco offer to work for free as an intern somewhere or something   it can be done and it 's really not too hard you just have to have lots of spending restraint because the little money you have has to go a long way so what are the other options well some people are recommending that you think about not going to college at all that will certainly save you money and give you a four year head start on whatever you decide to do freedom but you 'll forever be branded as that guy without a college degree   think my second option above but just two or three times worse    you wo n't even get that free internship and you 'll be that weird guy at dinner parties who answer the first question so where did you go to college   it does n't matter if you 're self taught   life is n't a meritocracy   if you 're very good you 'll end up getting a nice cushy job pushing ones and zeros a nice cushy golden job well you could go to community college they 're certainly cheap you can spend very little money so you 'll end up with fairly good freedom    i might add though that community colleges teach trades and not high level things like management and complex architecture    you 'll be behind technically but not as bad as if you did n't go at all how about connections your fellow students will probably lack ambition money and connections they 'll be candidates for entry level wage slave jobs at fortune 500 companies after they graduate if they get lucky they 'll work up to middle management there 's no alumni association and there 's certainly no club in downtown boston at new york and silicon valley dinner parties having a community college degree is almost as bad as having nothing at all   indeed the entire value of the community college degree will be what you learn and you 'll be learning at the speed and level of your classmates my advice if you get into an ivy league school go and hope you get some grants to help you out the debt will suck but you 'll be well positioned for the future otherwise go to a cheap second tier school where you can get a large scholarship there are also lots of third party scholarships that are out there on the internet you can get i got a couple from local organizations do n't work during college focus on expanding your network instead the future value of a minimum wage job while you 're trying to go through school is practically zero

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

you question is very hard to answer as it is tough to put a value on how much bad your added investment in evil companies would cause and also how much value the charities add   however there has been a bunch of really good work on socially responsible investing in general   this paper might be too technical for some but the conclusion section is very readable and clear the big worry about socially responsible investing from a financial standpoint is that it will lower returns in the long run   the paper above and others show fairly clearly that as long as you only exclude a few classes of stocks and still have a fairly broad base that the expected returns are similar   the main issue though is some socially responsible funds have much higher fees so the usual advice applies do your research to make sure your investments are well diversified and have low fees    as long as the index is fairly broad you can consider the difference between the fees on the socially responsible index and investing in a more common index as the long run cost   then you can balance that cost and having more money for charity against the benefits of not investing in evil companies

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

i think it is the debate here   the functional use case is that it takes seconds to plug in   even if you added all the time i 've spent on the go charging which is very little then the amount of time i 've spent charging has been less than the amount of time i would have spent filling up on gas over the course of several years   also like i said in the comment this is not just my use case   you can ask other drivers about it the vast majority will say they prefer charging now that they have experienced it   look at volts most of their miles are done on electricity and there are a lot of volt drivers who use the term gas anxiety because they do n't want to fill up with gas so they do everything they can not to let the engine turn on at all   and for another car example tesla installed a battery which made the filling up experience more gas like in that it took minutes and cost about $ 50   nobody used it   they instead plugged in at the free supercharger nearby got out to stretch their legs went to eat lunch and came back to their cars and drove off   heck i 've heard plenty of tesla owners that their car charged too quickly which meant they had to get up in the middle of lunch to go unplug it   very few people will regularly need to charge en route in something like a bolt model 3 or model s.   those very few people who routinely drive 300 miles in a day one way or with very little stop at their destination with which they could charge are a niche customer who does not need to be catered to at this moment in time   however and i get this all the time everyone on reddit thinks they 're part of that niche   on a website full of people who talk about spending all their day on reddit somehow these people get the time to spend driving 400 miles a day   not saying you 're doing that right now but lots of people do it here   of charge events will be normal day to day charges where it takes no time the on the go cases are few and far between   ev motorcycles are pretty reasonably priced but it sounds like you 've probably already done some research on them   check out zero if you have n't heard of them   cool thing about them is the battery is small so you can charge it on in a reasonable amount of time overnight and i 've heard from motorcycle drivers that they even feel more safe on an ev because all those brain cycles you spend on shifting and are freed up to spend on paying attention to the road which is full of cars that are trying to kill you   also the bolt is a fantastic car   highly recommend it   edit oh and with your name you should check out the lightning 's results at 's peak a few years ago   beat the by 20 seconds

so long as you do n't hate what you are doing i 'd say the price is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 100 200 year of income to be worth the bookkeeping i 'd only say more than that if you have a ridiculously complex tax situation you have an irrational hatred of filling out a few forms once a year or if you just have such a stupidly large amount of money that even having a few hundred dollars a year to donate to people in desperate need just does n't mean anything to you or if you are under special income limits and just a few dollars of income would put you in a bad situation like a loss of medical benefits etc the reason is actually quite simple the taxes are n't really that hard or time consuming i 've handled three self employment businesses in my life and unless you are trying to itemize every last dollar of business deductions and expenses or you really want to scrape out every last cent from minor deductions that require considerable extra paperwork it 's a few extra forms on your taxes most of the extra taxes are as a percentage so it reduces the benefits but really not by much you do n't have to make it extra complicated if the extra complexity does n't give you a big payoff in benefit i would suggest you pick the simplest imaginable possible system for accounting for this so that you might only spend an extra few hours per year on the books and taxes do n't keep $ 10 sheet music receipts if you feel it 's a burden to try to itemize expenses etc instead the decision should be if you or in this case your wife would enjoy doing it and bringing in money can just be nice in it 's own way i 'd suggest she keep some out for little extra niceties earmark some for feel good charitable giving and then of course sock away the rest do n't let extra income be an unnecessary burden that prevents you from getting it in the first place

it took me a while to understand the concept so i 'll break it down as best as i can   there are three parts to the accounting equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity we 'll look at this in two ways    1 as a business owner you invest say 10,000 usd into your bank the entry would be debit assets cash for 10,000     credit owner 's equity contributions for 10,000 in this case you have assets of 10,000 from your deposit but it is due to owner contributions and not business transactions another example say a sale   debit assets cash for 10,000     credit owner 's equity sales for 10,000 debit assets cash for 10,000     credit liabilities deposits for 10,000 deposits are a banking term to reflect a bank 's obligation to return the amount on demand though the bank has free reign with it see fractional banking   you will never debit or credit your bank as it is assumed you will be storing your money there note bank reconciliation hope this helps comment with any more questions

these government mandates of minimum wage will cause more problems than they will solve i do n't know how many of you own a small business but i can give you a real world example here in the city of chicago on july 1st 2017 the minimum wage will increase to $ while at the same time they 're introducing a .01 per oz sugar tax   the amount of additional work needed to keep track of sugar consumption will be burdensome for small businesses who will have to raise prices to accommodate the new labor costs and tax customers are price sensitive so they will usually go for the cheaper option which can be provided only by corporate big business who have the ability to automate certain positions in the labor supply chain which is currently happening i would n't be surprised if the timeline for kiosks self service robot implementation is on par with the $ 15.00 minimum wage deadline in 2019 to sum up big business wins and labor loses but i guess results do n't matter when your intentions are good

a huge part of the problem is that low income people have been very heavily marketed to by the online and for profit colleges because they were eligible for financial aid mainly loans and were seen only as a straw through which to suck money out of the government by these schools because they were only interested in the money there was no attempt to qualify students in many of these schools or provide any support to them when students dropped out their counselors would keep signing them up for classes that they did n’t know about or attend    because a lot of the schools are bullshit schools with either no reputation or a poor one even those who finished were largely not able to get the high paying jobs they were promised in order to lure them in this goes for low income students especially ones whose families have no previous experience with post high school education across the board and all of this group is far more likely to default because they were basically ripped off got nothing useful from these bogus schools and were often outright defrauded and do not have the income they were told they would have when agreeing to the loans but because there is a higher percentage of minorities among this group they are more likely to be but our student loan system does n’t differentiate between loans for real and loans for these rip off schools so you are still 100 on the hook regardless even if they signed you up for several more worth of classes after you withdrew   it ’s a lot like the mortgage collapse desperate to keep making money the lenders targeted increasingly less qualified people who were also naive about the entire system and sold them terrible loans sometimes talking them out of more reasonable options and then when the whole thing starts to fail it ’s all because the government made the banks give mortgages to poor black people   the institutions suck up the money and leave bewildered poor people holding the bag now even poorer with nothing to show for the debt they will literally be digging out of forever    the obama administration finally took some steps to control the predatory for profit institutions and try to sort out who had been ripped off vs people who had genuinely received any useful education but of course the new sec of education is doing her best to roll all that back   and most of the victims are n’t teens either they are adults with kids who were trying to do something to better themselves and their lives and got screwed over some of these middle aged people will literally be having their social security garnished to pay for these loans it ’s disgusting and even more so to say it ’s all affirmative action

the problem with this story is it 's basically saying run your business like betting on the lotto   just because there 's anecdotal evidence that a bob might grace your company does n't mean you should sell the company trying to please every customer    for every one company that bumps into a bob there are thousands who helping those disgruntled customers drive the business into the ground   this is not to say that companies should n't try to go above and beyond   it 's just above and beyond should be controlled   for example if i were to own a restaurant and i see a customer drop food on the floor i would enable my wait staff to clean it up and give free food as a replacement   but i would also limit this   if the customer starts throwing food at the staff i would also enable the staff to kick the mother fucker out   sure the customer might be a bob and come back later with 4 million dollars to give me but i 'd prefer my staff keep their fucking dignity

a ponzi scheme simply defined is where the uses funds invested by one person to pay off or provide a return for an earlier investor   such schemes require a continual supply of new investors and when they run it the schemes collapse bernie madoff is the best modern day example of how a ponzi scheme works and he ran his for decades before it finally in thanks to the 2008 economic crash   people who had been content to leave their returns with bernie started getting margin calls as the markets so they asked bernie for redemptions he did n't have the funds for   that 's what caused him to come clean because there was no way to hide it any longer buying shares in a company with no revenues and then selling them to someone else at a higher price is not a ponzi scheme   that falls under the greater fool theory of economics there 's always a bigger fool who can be from his money as was pointed out enron is a great example of what you 're talking about they published totally fabricated financial statements that people then used as the basis to invest only to learn later that it was all a lie

i 'd like to take a moment to point out   i can not find a bank that charges customers with a checking account fees for withdrawing from an atm owned by that same bank it is a cornerstone of most banks now to encourage online and atm banking you should definitely research the validity of the claim that you 're associate can not withdraw from their own account through their own bank 's atm without fees a second scenario i can think of is that this person uses a bank that does not operate in your region   then they can not find an atm owned by their bank   if this is the case they should simply go to the bank the check is drawn on and cash it there   so far i only know of chase bank charging non chase customers to cash a check drawn on a chase account this is a crap policy that makes me hate that bank disclaimer i am not familiar with all banks but a quick google search of banks that operate in your region should reveal which ones if any charge their customers for use of their atms   you may or may not find the check cashing charge policy without attempting to cash the check

normally when thinking about whether it 's worth it to start a small business the biggest factor is your time there 's a big difference between spending 10 hours to make a profit of $ 50 vs spending 1 hour to make a profit of $ 50 your scenario is quite different though in that you suggest your wife is considering teaching for free instead of accepting payment in this case the time factor almost goes away since if you accept payment there is very little extra time involved for depositing checks tracking income and filling out some extra forms come tax time from a financial point of view there is no reason to turn down the money if people are willing to pay it there may be other reasons to prefer doing it for free but taxes social security payments and the small extra effort to run the business would n't normally be among those reasons i do n't know what your reasons for possibly preferring to do it for free are but an alternative option to consider is to donate all of her income to charity

yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich   poor people spend all of their income   month to month living paycheck to paycheck poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities utilities etc   rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes   most of it gets stashed in and overseas holdings and does n't really change hands in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure   so your tax continuously hits 100 of the wealth of the bottom of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can   in short this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who does n't make $ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth   if you want to help the general public households making less than $ 300k year you need to generate more tax revenue from investments and capital   a 2 tax say on stock trades valued over $ 10,000 obviously would n't hurt poor people at all and also would n't really hurt the rich   cuz if you 've got 10 grand or a hundred or thousand or whatever to stash in shares of amazon or whatever you 're really not gon na miss the $ 200 that comes off the top of your trade   but this would generate huge tax revenue as there are thousands of such transfers a day

i 've never seen anything in any irs publication that placed limits on the balance of a 401 k only on what you can contribute and defer from taxes each year   the way the irs gets theirs as it were is on the taxes you have to pay for a traditional ira anyway which would not be when you start to figure out the required minimum distribution if the balance was you 're required to take out enough to in theory run the thing out of money by your life expectancy the irs has tables for this stuff to give you the exact numbers but for the sake of a simple example their number for someone age 70 single or with a spouse who is not more than 10 years younger is   if we round that to 28 to make the math nice then you would be forced to withdraw and pay taxes on around $ 500,000 per year   so there would be a hefty amount of taxes to be paid out for sure so a lot of that $ 500 k a year going to pay taxes on your distributions but then considering you only contributed   pre tax dollars in the first place what a wonderful problem to have to deal with   oh do n't throw me in that patch mr fox

since 2007 the world has seen a period of striking economic and financial volatility featuring the deepest recession since the 1930s despite this gold has performed strongly with its price roughly doubling since the global financial crisis began in 1 gold and real interest rates one of the factor that influences gold prices is real interest rate which is to some extent related to inflation since gold lacks a yield of its own the opportunity cost of holding gold increases with a real interest rate increase and decreases with a fall in real interest rates 2 gold and the us dollar the external value of the us dollar has been a significant influence on short term gold price movements the imf in 2008 that 40 50 of the moves in the gold price    since 2002 were dollar related with a 1 change in the effective    external value of the dollar leading to a more than 1 change in the    gold price source   3 gold and financial stress it is a significant and commonly observed influence on the short term price of gold in periods of financial stress gold demand may rise for a number of    reasons   4 gold and political instability it is another factor that can boost gold prices investor concerns about wars civil conflicts and international    tensions can boost demand for gold for similar reasons to those noted    above for periods of financial stress potential function as a    currency of last in case of serious system collapse provides    a particular incentive to hold it in case the political situation is    especially severe source 5 gold and official sector activity the behaviour of central banks and other parts of the official sector can have an important impact on gold prices   one reason for this is that central banks are big holders of gold    possessing some metric tons in 2010 which is approximately 15    of all above ground gold stocks as a result central bank policies on    gold sales and purchases can have significant effects and these    policies have been subject to considerable shifts over the decades source    source of above graphs

the next phase   by       one mind boggling question is this good for the economy   20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues to expand amplify waiting to explode to burst qe will keep you moving today but not for the rest of your life qe is the more you move the more you get sucked down qe will bring joy today later it will bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst    inflation will going to kill us all qe is a wrong medicine temporary patch or qe is it is just an easy money and definitely not a hard earned labor generated money qe is a gamble trillion dollars is at stake if we are lucky the dying person or the economy will live if we are not lucky the dying person will die the economy will going to collapsed and still we have to pay all the debts as long as we live qe is the economy today is at the mercy of qe   the economy is captive hostage by qe interest rates is a lose lose situations keeping it zero   the u.s.a government will lose trillions   and trillions of dollars that is badly needed   now raising this rates will surely and definitely starts   the u.s.a markets and precisely the world economy to react pulling down the unstable economies   of the whole world to jeopardy   now which one would you like to choose again which one would you prefer qe is trial and error a complex complicated solutions   healing one part of the body and the other part will swell and burst qe is evaporation using taxpayers money pension funds retirement benefits and all entitlements is going to fade will vanished in thin air qe are waiters simply waiting day and night for growth for recovery qe is it dries up the u.s.a treasury qe is debt a never ending debt keep in mind there is no such thing as unlimited debt or debt unlimited do n't be fooled qe will going to keep you in good sleep but will wake you up bankrupt qe is not an answer it is the culprit qe is universal it was copied all over the world worldwide qe is an absolute solutions yes for all dumb economists a hopeless desperate solutions qe to be specific is going back again to the 1930 's depression or the great depression part 2 yes precisely but with a big bang qe before is only a staggering risk today it is now debt simple as it keeps on giving birth by the hour the minutes the seconds and after eight long years the final   the end result is massive pure debt very sorry to say not growth and or definitely not recovery qe is a dying move no one not one ever dared to affirm to attest to certify that this is a correct solutions qe is mad it will make you crazy because of debt qe is the only options yes absolutely when your big brains is not working qe is easing the pain correct for a very short period of time but will going to destroy the economy in the long or short run qe is history it will you forever and ever qe what more can i say    fb

below i will try to explain two most common binomial option pricing models used first of all splits time to expiry into n equal sub periods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion so the value of an option in any sub period is a function of its possible values in the following sub period therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through sub periods to current time there is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a single period here are two ways of doing this first of all let 's summarize your information current share price vs = $ 70 strike or exercise price x = $ 60 risk free rate r = 5.5 or time to maturity t = 12 months downward movement in share price for the period d = $ 65 $ 70 = upward movement in share price for the period u = = = u can be translated to $ multiplying by vs = > $ 70 = $ which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time if you need more clarification here the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk but because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this you probably do n't have to bother too much about it yet intrinsic value just in case someone reading this is unclear the value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise strike price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity this is also called an intrinsic value   note that american option can be exercised prior to it 's maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise but the value of an option at period 0 also called option price is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it so say with a strike of $ 60 and share price of $ 70 the intrinsic value is $ 10 whereas if share price was $ 50 the intrinsic value would be $ 0 the option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed   so we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable and respectively = $ = $ 5 remember if strike was $ 70 then would be $ 0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money = $ = $ 1 setting up a hedge ratio   h = h = 5 = 1 that means we have to write sell 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks you can make a simple calculation to check this but i 'm not going to go into too much detail here as the is not about hedging because this position is risk free in equilibrium it should pay a risk free rate 5.5 then the formula to price an option vc using the hedging approach is vs where vc is the value of the call option h is the hedge ratio vs current share price highest probable share price r risk free rate t time in years value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price therefore solving for vc 70 = 1 = > = 60 = > = = > vc = 70   which is similar to the formula given in your textbook so i must assume that using would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above then it is easy to find that vc = ~ $ 2 risk neutral valuation another way to calculate vc is using a risk neutral approach we first introduce a variable p which is a risk neutral probability of an increase in share price p = d so in your case p = = therefore using p the vc would be equal vc = = > vc = = > vc = ~ $ as you can see it is very close to the hedging approach i hope this answers your questions also bear in mind that there is much more to the option pricing than this the most important topics to cover are multi period accounting for dividends black scholes merton option pricing model

a insured high interest savings bank account is both safe and liquid i.e. you can withdraw your money at any time   at present time you could earn interest of per year if you shop around if you are willing to truly lock in for 2 years minimum rates go up slightly but perhaps not enough to warrant loss of liquidity look at gic rates to get an idea any other investments such as mutual funds stocks index funds etfs etc are generally not consistent with your stated risk objective and time frame better returns are generally only possible if you accept the risk of loss of capital or lock in for longer time periods

i 've consulted to a few companies before and i have to say the biggest problem i found among them was their inability to understand growth   now most companies become ambitious and in a sense want to grow and increase their profits but are completely off in how to do it   this can be seen from a manufacturing sales engineering perspective and administrative functions the idea that always sticks in their minds is they have to add personal if they wish to grow though that is n't always true   as an external person with no set bias you should be able to figure out a creative way to their problems even if they have n't noticed them yet    another area i 've come to see problems in is debt i 've seen successful companies held down by their they run a cash only business to others that took on too much debt   there is no easy solution to this yet a gradual and conservative approach to this area can help them in the long run   on the same topic i often think there are lots of inefficiencies in finances and the support groups that can be in an easy manner    lastly the biggest problem i 've seen with every single small business is customer service   as they grow the lack of training is apparent and there is no common ground as to how employees should be their company     good luck

first make sure you have some money in a savings account that you can use instead of credit cards for making future purchases that go beyond what you have in your checking account $ 1000 is a good amount to start with so just take that out of the $ 5000 then pay off the best buy card you should n't be worried about the minimum payment determine what you can pay per month say $ 400 and take the minimum payments out of that then choose one card to get the rest of your $ 400 plus the remaining $ 1500 of your $ 5000 this should be the highest interest card mathematically but it may or may not be your best choice it depends on your personality some people get a psychological lift out of seeing debts disappear and it gives them more motivation to keep going those people may be better served by paying off the smallest debts first to get them out of the way i 'm an so it bothers me more to think that i 'll be paying a little more in interest over the long term by taking that route

there are several tactics you might employ to help the situation   you have two options one is to increase your income the other is to reduce your expenditure   paying off debt will also help but that may not apply to you most people find it easier to reduce expenditure so i will explain that first of all then make sure you track your actual expenditure the budget check it daily and make sure it is accurate if you spend some money you did n't budget for then mark that down and make sure you budget for it going forward most people are surprised at how much they are actually spending especially on trivial things like coffee lunch at work etc   you will then find you can start to reduce this expenditure maybe by bringing lunch to work skipping coffee every other day etc by doing a budget you can reduce your expenditure and hopefully have some money left over to save put a line in your budget marked savings ideally on the day you get paid so you do n't spend it if you ned to save $ x by y date then work out how much that works out in a month and put that into your budget if you have n't got enough spare to do that then onto stage 2 with regards to increasing income the obvious way is to do some overtime at work can you do that alternatively you can get a part time job maybe a hobby that pays money   i personally enjoy building web sites as a hobby and i get about $ 20 a month from advertising on those it 's not much but it adds up over time finally how to actually save what methods are there lots of options here personally i buy shares with my savings making sure i pick stocks that are currently cheap this is quite risky and may not suit you but it works for me as i do n't sell the shares until i actually need the money other options are regular savings accounts that pay a bonus after you 've had the money in for usually 12 months etc   they tend to pay a bonus at the end so you are to not touch your cash but you can get it out if you really need it you can also work out how much spare cash you have monthly and then give yourself an allowance each month that you can spend on impulse items but make sure you stick to that good luck

you should definitely favor holding bonds in tax advantaged accounts because bonds are not tax efficient the reason is that more of their value comes in the form of regular periodic distributions rather than an increase in value as is the case with stocks or stock funds with stocks you can choose to realize all that appreciation when it is most advantageous for you from a tax perspective additionally stock dividends often receive lower tax rates for much more detail see tax efficient fund placement

gt your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   the one in the title if yes here it is restated   as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   so i was wondering if this conclusion summary understanding is flawed in some way

ditto bill and i upvoted his answer but let me add a bit if everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit or more precisely integral of risk times potential profit if company a was 100 guaranteed to make $ 1 million profit this year while company b had 50 change to make a $ 2 million profit and 50 to make $ 0 and every investor in the world knew that then i 'd expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value the catch to that though is that no one really knows the risk the risk is n't like we 're going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes $ 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes $ 0 so we could calculate the exact probability the risk comes from lack of information will consumers want to buy this new product how many what are they willing to pay how capable is the new ceo etc it 's very hard to calculate probabilities on these things how can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur so in real life prices are the risk reward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear but that 's about the most one can say

you re assuming that gdp shows the amount of wealth created and is an indicator of the standard of living but it is not govt spending adds to gdp but takes away from the productive of the private sector which is the part of the economy that is making things that people want and need the govt can spend 1 trillion on building a to obama and that would increase gdp by 1 trillion but no wealth is created and the govt shift a trillion of tax revenues to the workers who built the if a company spends 1 trillion building building some new gadget then the people who spend money to buy i have something to show for it and the workers have their wages as well so now the company makes back 1.2 trillion and the consumers have their gadget ie real wealth has been created    the wealthy may be on of cash but its not just sitting under their mattress its spread out between investments and savings savings is to build up productive capabilities the money the rich have sitting in banks is being used to help other businesses grow not just collecting dust i wish it were as simple as giving every poor person 10 grand and watching the economy take off remember when bush gave everyone a 1000 tax refund it sure was fun blowing that on a ps3 i ca nt argue with that but prosperity can not be printed it must be earned through hard work and productive activity what we need is not monetary stimulus we need the govt to stop the private sector with burdensome regulations and taxes we need lower barriers to entry so we maximize competition in every industry we need the govt spending less and pushing more workers into the private sector making things that american can get some utility from its not going to be a smooth ride getting there there will be lots of lay offs in the short run as the economy but if the govt got out of the way and let the free market prosper our society would be far better off in the future

i know what you are talking about and this is what students at uc i know usually do in such cases talk with the 's office and see if you have been reported to collections if you had plans to pay via financial aid this can be a non issue but be sure it 's critical to remove your record from collections if any take a loan and find out how the loan will be paid most lenders pay the school directly based on what the school bills for the quarter if you signed up for x units in fall 10 and plan to take y units in winter 12 add x+y units in your list of courses those x units could be anything in your course catalog once the school sends out the bill and the lender pays it drop the x units this will give you a check and use that to pay out the outstanding amounts most schools will include all outstanding amounts in the bill for your current quarter but i am not sure if your lenders has agreements otherwise also some lenders have agreements in place to send refunds directly to them but remember the cashier is king and she can make refunds happen the way she likes and she is likely to help a student unless you have a bad payment history collections bounced checks

what you are looking for is travel insurance i have never heard of this being offered as a credit card perk but there might be something out there   you can buy this separately but only you can decide if it is worth the costs to me it would seem to only be worth it for something quite expensive like a cruise that costs thousands of dollars the more you travel the less likely it is to be worth it since at some point the cost of one canceled trip is less than the insurance paid on the rest of the trips that went through fine as a frequent i recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans especially during the winter it is not always possible but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight   try to book flights early in the day as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them and you have more options for flight delays due to weather and mechanical problems are not uncommon and with generally full flights it is sometimes hard to be in a reasonable amount of time   finally be nice to the gate agents and other airline   in general they are n't any happier about delays than you are flight crews want to get home too and do n't have any power over weather or mechanical delays   being rude to them will not help and will make them less likely to go out of their way to find a solution be in asking for what you want but a smile and a kind word goes a long way

keep in mind that the exchanges do not hold buy or sell the stock people or funds do   all the exchange does is facilitate the sale of stock from one entity to another so the shares outstanding and market cap for a company are set regardless of how many exchanges the stock is listed on   the company typically indicates the number of shares outstanding in its financial statements   i do not know if the exchange itself keeps track of shares outstanding it may just report whatever the company publishes so theoretically if you wanted to buy all of the stock of a company you could do it all in one exchange provided that all the existing holders of the stock were willing to sell you their shares   there are many issues with that though which i do n't think are to your question

your question contains a faulty assumption during crashes and corrections the amount of sellers is of course higher than the amount of buyers making it difficult to sell stocks this simply is n't true   every trade has two sides thus by definition for every seller there is buyer and vice versa   even if we broaden the definition of buyers and sellers to mean people willing to buy or sell at some price the assumption still is n't true   when a stock is falling it is generally not because potential buyers are exiting the market it is because they are the prices they are willing to buy at downward    for example say there are a bunch of orders to buy consolidated dumb at $ 5 suppose dumb announces a downward revision to its earnings guidance those people might not be willing to buy at $ 50 anymore so they 'll probably cancel their $ 50 buy orders   however just because dumb is n't worth as much as they thought it was that does n't mean it 's completely worthless   so those prospective buyers will likely enter new orders at some lower value say $ 45   with that the value of dumb has just dropped by $ 5 a 10 correction   however there are still plenty of buyers and you can still sell your dumb holdings if you 're willing to take $ 45 for them in other words the value of a security is not determined by the relative numbers of buyers and sellers   it is determined by the prices those buyers and sellers are willing to pay to buy or accept to sell   except for cases of massive it disruptions such as we saw in the flash crash there is always somebody willing to buy or sell at some price

there are usually so many different options around for the same stock that some are rarely traded especially if the price has moved since the option was issued nobody might be interested in that particular option at that price anymore so the asking price might be something that someone asked for ages ago and that is much higher than anyone would reasonably pay today   with a bid of $ 20 and an ask of $ 30 nobody is trading but the value of that option is somewhere between $ 20 and $ 30 if the value is below $ 25 someone will notice your $ 25 bid and sell

i had a similar situation when i was in college the difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history the dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork i told them that i would not pay that and i dropped the car off at the lot with a letter the sale they were n't happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a $ 1000 discount from the previously agreed upon purchase price what i learned through that experience is that i did n't do a good enough job of negotiating the original price i would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time if the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it he owes nothing further if the dealer has not cashed the check he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer this only works if your son keeps his nerve and is willing to walk away from the car

hsas are very similar to iras any investment returns grow tax deferred and once you reach age 59 1/2 65 you can withdraw the funds for any purpose subject to ordinary income tax just like a traditional ira if you can afford to do so i would recommend you to pay medical expenses out of pocket and let the funds in your hsa accumulate and grow in general the best way to allocate your funds is in the following order contribute to a 401(k if your employer matches funds at a substantial rate pay off high interest debt 8 of more in current environment in 2011 contribute to an ira traditional or roth contribute to an hsa contribute to a 401(k without the benefit of employer matching one advantage of hsas versus iras is that you do n't have to have earned income salary or self employment income in order to contribute if you derive income solely from rents interest or dividends you can contribute the maximum amount $ for individuals in 2011 and get a full deduction from your income of course you will need to maintain a high deductible health plan in order to qualify one downside of hsas is the lack of competitively priced providers wells fargo offers hsas for free but only allows you to keep your funds in cash earning a very measly interest rate or invest them in rather mediocre and expensive wells fargo mutual funds vanguard known for its low fee investment options provides hsas through a partner company but the account maintenance charges are still quite high overall hsas are a worthwhile option as part of your investment plan

defined benefit plans defined benefit plans are disappearing because of their high cost to the companies that provide them   when an employee retires the company must pay his pension for the rest of his life even longer if the pension includes a survivor option   thus the company 's financial burden grows as more employees retire    by law they must provide a fund that has sufficient resources to pay all present and future pensions   low interest rates such as we have now place a greater burden on the amount that must be in these funds    for these reasons most companies including large ones like ibm and lockheed martin have discontinued their pension plans and provide only defined contribution plans    defined contribution plans these require the company to only make contributions while the employee is working   once the employee retires the company 's responsibility ends   usually these plans employ a 401 k type savings plan for which the employee contributes and the companies matches some or all of that contribution   comparison although a fully company paid pension plan is the best it is now almost unavailable   the defined contribution plan if it includes company matching can be a viable alternative if the investments are chosen wisely and perform as expected   of course this is not guaranteed but is probably the best option that most working people have at this time

ok fair enough but you did say a large part of their barrier to entry is government in relation to general industry in defense of your earlier statement that monopolies can rarely exist without one or two things government support or limited geographic area   my contention is that regulation can present a barrier to entry but this is not nearly as large a barrier as size and barriers due to size is the primary reason for monopolies or oligopolies in recent times   if you do n't want to use the aircraft industry as an example let 's use amazon itself amazon is cleaning everyone 's clocks whatever you try and sell if it is available on amazon a smaller player will not be able to compete with them except on the edges their market share continues to increase they own 43 of all us online retail   why does n't someone just start up and compete with them why are n't there 10 12 different competitors to amazon   now clearly amazon got a head start they were among the first to shift into the non specialized internet retail market pets.com only sold pet food whereas amazon now sells everything there is no arguing that they do things very well and have advanced the area of online sales   but they are now without competition and will not have significant competition unless they badly and even then they may not have competition see ebay which now sucks but still has no real competition   when i look at changing sectors in my general geographic area i see massive up sizing coupled with a lack of new entries into the sector i 'll give a few examples   auto dealers i had a relative who owned a dealership in the 70s just one he did ok from it now most of the dealerships are owned by people who own somewhere between 5 and 15 different dealerships    gas stations i had a relative who owned a gas station again just one there were lots of these guys around now most of the gas stations are owned by 2 or 3 conglomerates who own many dozens of stations   banks yes regulation is in play here but there used to be dozens of different banks in my region now there are maybe 2 regional banks and 3 national banks gone are the days when there was one bank that had 2 3 branches even credit unions are consolidating   hardware stores we are down to home depot lowe 's and a regional chain that has 20 30 stores no independent guys   grocery stores my region has exactly two full service grocery store chains plus maybe 2 discount chains when i was a kid there were 10 different regional chains in the area    not the best example but video stores there used to be 10 12 different mom and pop stores which consolidated into two blockbuster hollywood video which got crushed by netflix smart tvs have allowed for there to be more players in the on demand world but the level of skill needed to enter this area can not be more different between the initial mom and pop video store and the world of online content delivery   the list goes on and on consolidation is the name of the game and when a market the average person can no longer enter it as it further the above average person can no longer enter it and when it gets to a certain point no one can enter it that has harmed the economy because people have stopped playing the game because they know they ca n't win they ca n't compete with the big boys   now i do n't know what to do about this but my observation is that this has accelerated in the past 30 years i think that technology has accelerated it but i also think that tax code and lack of anti trust enforcement has also accelerated it i would put my bet on tax code as the 1 culprit tax code has made it attractive for people to try and earn tens of millions of dollars per year there is truth to the conservative claim that if the tax rates are too high people will not work as hard that 's not necessarily a bad thing though markets are driven by demand and at any point in time they have a finite demand a total size if there is $ 15 million worth of demand for hardware in a region that demand can either be satisfied by one massive global corporation or by 15 $ 100k small businesses or by 30 $ 50k small businesses    there can be an advantage to one massive global corporation cheaper prices higher quality but there can also be a downside which is eventually higher prices less innovation and even lower quality plus the downside of the elimination of opportunity for the 30 people who would serve that demand if the massive corporation did not exist opportunities which turned over every so often due to businesses closing due to retirement or even incompetence    i do not think that tax code innovation though because people innovate for passion not for money steve jobs and steve wozniak founded apple when the top tax rate was 70 they did it because they wanted to make computers not because they wanted to make money i think that a high tax rate would stifle the relentless pursuit of more dollars by using existing dollars to consolidate sectors

first to answer the question   the benefit of a 401k is that you do n't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates   you get that with the restriction that you ca n't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account and you are taxed on withdrawals more severely if you do it before you are 65   similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits   now for the 7000 not providing benefit   assuming a very modest 4 growth over 40 years 7000 becomes not something to sneeze at inflation risk reward blah blah blah it is less than it looks but 4 is really pretty low the stock market averages anywhere from and iirc the bond market is somewhere around 5   now certainly to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw   however if it is possible you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account   the penalties and lost earning opportunities are pretty significant   /u has the r finance for how much you lose by doing an early withdraw   do n't do this lightly and i would suggest avoiding cashing out the whole thing if you can

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

as mentioned in several other answers the main reason for high rates is to maximize profit however here is another smaller effect the typical flow of getting money from an atm suppose you have a minute to consider the offer then in that time the currency may drop or rise which you can see from an external source of information therefore this opens a window for abuse for real major currencies these huge switches are rare but they do happen and when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common just looking at a random pair for today to i immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 this may not be the best example but it shows why a large margin is desirable note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be for cases where it is calculated afterwards i have not found any valid excuse for such large margins except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction

it includes whatever you want to do with your investment   at least initially it 's not so much a matter of calculating numbers as of soul searching   identifying your investment objectives means asking yourself why do i want to invest   then you gradually ask yourself more and more specific questions to narrow down your goals   for instance if your answer is something very general like to make money then you may start to ask yourself how much money do i want what will i want to use that money for when will i want to use that money etc   of course not all objectives are realistic so identifying objectives can also involve down plans that are too one thing that can be helpful is to first identify your financial objectives that is money you want to be able to have and things you want to do with that money   investment in the sense of purchasing investment vehicles likes stocks or bonds is only one way of achieving financial goals other ways include working for a paycheck starting your own business etc   once you identify your financial goals you have a number of options for how to get that money and you should consider how well suited each strategy is for each goal for instance for a financial goal like paying relatively small short term expenses e.g. your electric bill investing would probably not be the first choice for how to do that because a there may be easier ways to achieve that goal e.g. ask for a raise eat out less and b the kinds of investment that could achieve that goal may not be the best use of your money e.g. because they have lower returns

is it true that you can not amend a tax return to include both a    futures loss carry back and a schedule c at the same time no it is not true you can include all the changes necessary in a single amended return attaching statement explaining each of the changes however you 're talking about two different kinds of changes futures loss is a sec and not a correction of an error adding schedule c would be a correction of an error i 'm guessing your cpa wants to separate the two kinds to avoid the situation where the irs refuses to accept your correction of an error and by the way also does n't accept the sec on the same return or the cpa just wants to charge you twice for amendments

first of all congratulations on being in an incredible financial position   you have done well so let 's look at the investment side first    if you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8 growth and add 75,000 every year in 10 years you 'll have about $ million $ 800k of which is capital gain more or less due to market risk of course or $ after 30 tax   if you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7 you 'll have about $ 1.3 million $ of which is tax free capital gain so the insurance is costing you $ 430 k in opportunity cost since you could have done something different with the money for more return    the fund you mentioned vanguard wellington has a 10-year annualized growth of   at that growth rate the opportunity cost is $ 350k   even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5 growth rate the opportunity cost is $ now the life insurance   life insurance is a highly personal product but i ran a quick quote for a old male in good health and got a premium of $ 11,000 per year for a $ 2 m 10-year term policy   so the same amount of term life insurance costs only $ 110,000   much less than the $ in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you in addition you have a mortgage that 's costing you about $ 28 k per year now 3.5 of 800,000 why would you invest in a 1.7 insurance policy when you are paying a low 3.5 mortgage i would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible and get it paid off quickly then you do n't need life insurance   then you can do whatever you want   retire early invest and give like crazy travel the world whatever    i see no compelling reason to have life insurance at all let alone life insurance wrapped in a bad investment vehicle

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

this is why we tell people not to co sign unless they are able and willing to risk that money becoming a gift or are able and willing to treat it as business rather than family unfortunately that advice is a bit late now to help you when you cosigned you promised the bank that you would make any payments he did n't the bank does n't care why he did n't they just want their money on time getting him to repay you for covering this is strictly between the two of you and unless you signed paperwork at the time establishing a contract other than the promise to cover his loan this becomes extremely messy first step is to make the payments so the loan does n't continue acquiring fees and hurting your credit rating and keep it from falling behind again then you have to convince him to repay the money you have effectively given him depending on your relationship and financial situations you may decide to carry him for a while and trust that he 'll pay you back when he can or sic a lawyer on him you need to make that decision recognizing that it may be a matter of how much family drama you are willing to tolerate

there is no fundamental good reason i think that 's just how it 's done which is what all the other answers seem to be saying w/o coming out and admitting it just guessing but i 'll bet most of the reason is historical before up to the moment quotes were readily available that was a bit tedious to calculate update the fund 's value so enacted laws let it be done just once per day   quotes the security act of 1940 which certainly has been updated but also still might contain the results of like this there are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks though one share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock there is a finite supply of company x stock and people are trading that piece of ownership around and barter to find an mutually agreeable price   but when you buy into a mutual fund the mutual fund suddenly has more shares it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings   as a consequence the mutual fund 's price is n't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund and that 's the weighted total of its underlying stock   if you wanted to sell your ownership of mutual fund z to a friend at there would n't be any bartering you 'd just calculate the value based on the stated value of the underlying stock at that exact moment so there 's no inherent reason you ca n't instantaneously price a mutual fund   but people do n't really buy sell funds to each other they go to the fund manager and essentially make a deposit or withdraw   the fund manager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often so that 's all they do disclaimer i know very little about markets and finance but i recognize answers that are just because

even though this is n't really personal finance related i still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed i do n't know where you got the phrase pass through insurance from   what you 're describing is a self funded plan   in a self funded arrangement an employer contracts a third party administrator tpa usually one of the big health insurance carriers to use it 's provider network process and claims etc   in addition to the tpa there will be some sort of stop loss insurance coverage on each participant   stop loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime   the employer 's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage assuming the stop loss does n't have a maximum almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people   these costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues   a cancer patient can easily cost $ 1,000,000 in a year   someone 's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a surgery will in a year if we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance small group is tightly regulated   usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority there is no negotiating your group 's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums    employers have no way of obtaining any medical claim information on employees mid market is a pooled arrangement   the overall pool has a total increase and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums   employers get very minor claims data things like the few highest claims or number of claims over a certain threshold but no employee specific information large group is a mostly arrangement   generally your group receives it 's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance   in general the carrier is some risk to a stop loss carrier and employer 's get a fair amount of insight in to claims though again not with employee names self funded is obviously self contained   the employer sets up a claims checking account   the tpa has draft authority on the account   the employee 's typically have no idea the plan is self funded their id cards will have the carrier logo and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member   generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop loss activity   this committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process there are some new partially self funded arrangements which is just a really low threshold   and relatively expensive stop loss program that 's becoming somewhat popular in the mid market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend    i think when you start thinking on a micro single employee level you really lose sight of the big picture   why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease chronic problem that costs $ 50,000 per year   and logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person   i understand the logic of the argument but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month   so a mid level hr hiring manager 1 is n't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee 2 wo n't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it 's against the law 3 a company generally wo n't test the water here because $ 50,000 per year is less than 1 of the company 's annual medical expenses 4 $ 50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law suit     really the flaw in your thought process is that $ 50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot   a harsh child birth can run in the $ 250,000 range so these companies never hire women   or never hire men who could add a spouse who 's in child bearing years   or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years   a diagnosis will ratchet up $ 1,000,000 in a year   spend a bit of time in intensive care for $ 25,000 per day and you 're fired   a few thousand bucks on diabetes meds is n't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self funded plan the second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims   they do n't third you do n't hand over medical records on your resume anyway i typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything   i just wanted paint a broad picture i 'm sure things can be nit picked or focused on

the principle behind the advice to not throw good money after bad is better restated in economics terms sunk costs are sunk and irrelevant to today 's decisions    money lost on a stock is sunk and should not affect our decisions today one way or the other   similarly the stock going up should not affect our decisions today one way or the other   any advice other than this is assuming some kind of mispricing or predictability in the market   in general can not be reliably identified and stock returns are not normally predictable the only valid efficient markets reason i know of to allow money you have lost or made on a stock to affect your decision today is the tax implications you may want to lock in gains if your tax rate is temporarily low or vice versa

i 'm all in on hard silver a small portion is stored at my house for emergency expenditures and the vast majority is in a high security vault in canada that was actually the cheapest place i could find for long term storage and insurance which happened to be off shore it could turn out to be beneficial to be off shore though in the 1930s gold became illegal to privately own its very possible they could do the same this time although they did n't in 1979 oil is too high in volume to reasonably store gold is n't as undervalued as silver which i could spend a full day talking about but to sum it up in a few points there is less silver than there is gold gold has a premium for jewelry which will likely go down in a crash even though you will still see gains silver is the second most used commodity besides oil less people are in the know about it silver prices were actually higher than gold a few times in the past century simply measuring the dow in silver will show it 's further below the historical average compared to gold i 'll stop there but i could go on though on silver if people want real estate is still very expensive from the 2008 recession traditionally mortgages are $ 1.05 per dollar you would spend on renting the same property currently real estate is at like $ 1.25 + i believe it peaked at about $ i rent to save money which you can spend on other assets   if one 's willing to move to another state for lower taxes they definitely should employment is going to be harder to come by and they should get as much out of it as possible as they can if they do n't save enough they could end up just using their entire savings during the whole thing if they ca n't find a job in which case at the end you 'd never know they knew it was going to happen   overall i do n't think this crash is going to be like the great depression i do n't feel compelled to store food and buy a generator or anything i believe the living will be easier than it were to live in the 90s for those who are invested in assets everything is going to be on sale meanwhile their wealth will be increasing depending on how much they own it could be increasing faster than they need to spend it sounds like the life to me but with that said those without real assets especially the lower class will be unemployed and living on food stamps perhaps even the food stamps making more people leave the dollar and the economy this actually might not be a prediction and is what happening already but i do n't believe anybody in america at least will be starving in the 30s we had not mastered industry farming yet and we had the to make things worse    crime though i 'd own a gun the protesters are here already and i think we are just passing the half way point right now they will get   i do n't know enough about taxes to know the best country or place to store to combat taxes maybe someone else can chime in i 'm in canada to avoid high insurance and storage fees   and for careful selection of primary residence in the long haul i 'd rent a small apartment as small and cheap as possible in a safe neighborhood but not so much that a single grocery store or gas station going out of business could ruin it

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

an asset allocation formula is useful because it provides a way to manage risk rebalancing preserves your asset allocation the investment risk of a well diversified portfolio with a few etfs or mutual funds in there to get a wide range of stocks bonds and international exposure is mostly proportional to the asset class distribution if you started out with half stocks and half bonds and stocks surged 100 over the past few years while bonds have stayed flat then you may be left with say 66 stocks and 33 bonds your portfolio is now more vulnerable to future stock market drops the risk associated with stocks most asset allocation recommendations are a little more specific than a stock bond split but i 'm sure you can get the idea rebalancing can be profitable because it 's a way to enforce you to buy low sell high massive recessions notwithstanding usually not everything in your portfolio will rise and fall at the same time and some are actually negatively correlated that 's one idea behind diversification anyway if your stocks have surged chances are that bonds are cheaper this does n't always work repeatedly transferring money from bonds into stocks while the market was falling in 2008 2009 could have lost you even more money also if you rebalance frequently you might incur expenses from the trading depending on what sort of financial instrument you 're holding it may be more effective to simply channel new money into the sector that you 're light on and limit the major rebalancing of the portfolio so that it 's just an occasional thing talk to your financial adviser

there are two common types of p e ratio calculations trailing and forward and then there are various mixes of the two trailing p e ratios are calculated as current price trailing 12-month eps an alternative is the forward p e ratio which is based on an estimate of earnings in the coming 12 months the estimate used is usually called consensus and to answer your question is the average estimate of analysts who cover the stock any reputable organization will disclose how they calculate their financials for example reuters uses a trailing ratio indicated by ttm on their page for bhp so the first reason a pe ratio might not jump on an announcement is it might be forward looking and therefore not very sensitive to the realized earnings the second reason is that if it is a trailing ratio some of the annual eps change is known prior to the annual announcement for example on 12/31 a company might report a large drop in annual earnings but if the bulk of that loss was reported in a previous quarterly report then the trailing eps would account partially for it prior to the annual announcement   in this case i think the first reason is the culprit the reuters p e of nearly 12 is a trailing ratio so if you see 8 i 'd think it must be based on a forward looking estimate

gt they deficit spend they increase prosperity and thus demand   but what i 'm saying is that there are more efficient ways of accomplishing this that does n't involve any debt whatsoever if the the debt money being spent is coming from your paycheck in the form of an increased cost of living then merely increasing the ratio of wages to capital returns would provide the same benefit without debt in fact this means of driving demand is so efficient that if you take it too far it 'll drive stagflation when the cost to capital returns exceeds an optimal ratio    gt;the interesting side effect is that they are making the economy do better   yes it certainly does over a limited number of years following the debt incurred but it is only an economic benefit because that same demand has already been taken from the economy in the form of wage suppression as a ratio of returns and not absolute values if those wage returns were too high relative to returns like in the 1970s in the us then driving more demand through debt spending would be the opposite of a benefit it 's only a short term benefit because that demand has already been taken from your wages   gt;the government gives you more income than it takes from you in taxes   this is true in more ways than one and i 'm not absolutely certain in which sense you mean it in terms of say the earned income tax credit it 's nowhere near enough to cover the losses incurred through wage suppression in terms of teachers infrastructure up to a point etc these things have a productive return on investment   gt;every bit of cut spending removes income from the population   no not that the spending cuts being done are anything but harmful and costing the economy but paying people to count flies on is not helpful at all and if it results in a net positive it 's because the economy is in a bad state of mismanagement with wages as an aggregate ratio of returns too suppressed for a healthy economy it 's like cutting people and saying it benefits the economy by increasing the sale of band aids and driving demand for doctors of course the band aids help but it does n't mean the policies that makes it a benefit anything but a cost    once wages as an aggregate ratio of returns exceeds an optimal ratio like in the prod media newshour jpg then every new increase in demand results in a new deficit in supply that can not be met due to constraints on capital returns i call this a supply constrained economy as opposed to the demand constrained economy we now live in in this kind of economic environment there would even be any short term benefits to funding consumption with debt   so basically you have two choices make everybody wealthy enough to match supply while trying not to exceed it to avoid triggering too much inflation and encouraging investment in new productive capacity or suppressing wage returns too much relative to total returns inducing excessively low and potentially negative inflation making almost everybody much poorer than necessary then trying to fix the imbalance between supply and demand through debt spending i would call the second choice a fools choice   but none of this means that funding for teachers social workers etc should go away these things need their funding and we should be paying the taxes to fund them not pretending that debt spending will let of have our cake and eat it to it 's like a pot luck dinner in which people bring ious in place of dishes until people are leaving dinner hungry because there 's not enough to go around   economic trouble has nothing to do with efficiency and how much work needs to be done and everything to do with how much money people have to spend   that is in fact true in our present economic circumstances but that situation was created by wage suppression relative to total returns in aggregate but as the 1970s demonstrated the opposite can also be true this realization is what drove the reagan revolution only the fed policy operates monetary easing and all on the assumption that this is driven by the employment rate or wiki it 's not it 's driven by the aggregate ratio between capital to labor returns and leads to bad economic conditions differently at both extremes which is why they find our present economic situation an mystery    the mistake of thinking how much money people have to spend i.e. strictly demand side driven economics is what created the economic problems that lead to reagan only now the power structure takes the opposite extreme in which supply side driven economics has become an article of faith this is why the older generation like myself say and believe such bat shit crazy things about the economy today the same older generation now that now drives politics because they came of age in the 1970s when what you are saying would have been a bad policy a policy that gave us stagflation that many classical keynesian 's thought impossible before then they ca n't believe something that was so bad can now be a good thing but it in fact is because the important thing for prosperity and growth is the optimal balance between supply and demand not the argument over whether the economy is supply side driven or demand side driven because either of those agendas can push the economy out of balance   automation will pretty certainly change everything about economics in the coming years but that is not why we are in the situation we are in at this particular moment

it 's harder than you think   once card companies start seeing your debt to credit line ratios climb they will slash your credit lines quickly also cash credit lines are always much smaller so in reality such a scheme would require you to buy goods that can be converted to cash which dilutes your gains and makes it more likely that you 're going to get detected and busted think of the other problems where do you store your ill gotten gains how do you get the money out of the country how will your actions affect your family and friends also most people are basically good people the prospect of defrauding $ 100k leaving family and friends behind and living some anonymous life in a third world country is n't an appealing one if you are criminally inclined building up a great credit history is not very practical most criminals are by nature reactive and want quick results

you are assuming 100 occupancy and 100 rent collection   this is unrealistic   you could get lucky and find that long term tenant with great credit that always pays their bills but in reality that person usually buys a home they do not rent long term   so you will need to be prepared for periods of no renters and periods of non payment   the expenses here i would expect could wipe out more than you can make in profit based on your numbers have you checked to find out what the insurance on a rental property is   i am guessing it will go up probably 200 500 a year possibly more depending on coverage   you will need a different type of insurance for rental property have you checked with your mortgage provider to make sure that you can convert to a rental property    some mortgages mine is one restrict the use of the home from being a rental property   you may be required to refinance your home which could cost you more in addition if you are under water it will be hard to find a new financier willing to write that mortgage with anything like reasonable terms you are correct you would be taking on a new expense in rental   it is non deductible and the irs knows this well    as littleadv 's answer stated you can deduct some expenses from your rental property i am not sure that you will have a net wash or loss when you add those expenses   if you do then you have a problem since you have a business losing money   this does not even address the headaches that come with being a landlord by my quick calculations if you want to break even your rental property should be about this accounts for 80 occupancy and 80 rental payment   if you get better than that you should make a bit of a profit do nt worry i m sure the house will find a way to reclaim it

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

the interesting thing about an fsa is that you have access to your total annual election immediately   after electing to put $ 200 per month toward your fsa you can go have a $ 1,500 surgery on january 3rd and pay with your fsa funds   then you can leave the company on february 1st and not owe the company anything i understand that you do n't like that this is the answer but it is   the employer is on the hook for the full elected liability of an fsa plan as of the first day of the plan year   the employer is also paying admin costs that are n't passed to the employees   you contest that this arrangement could leave current employees picking up the bag for employees but there is no employee liability   fsa plans run at a net cost the the employer i 'm sure there are outlier exceptions however i disagree with your premise that   employees generally dislike that fsa plans are use it or lose it and also that there appears to be an obvious alternative that would be preferable the employees that dislike the rules of fsa accounts do n't fully understand the nuances and surely assume that fsa is a synonym for hsa   tons of employers offer their employees fsa plans and they are very well received   you can fill full prescriptions off of a debit card on the third day of the year before you 've even contributed anything hsas are great i have one but they require enrollment in a hdhp and you can only spend the funds currently available in your account   these are two huge limitations addressed by fsa plans   you can have a $ 0 deductible platinum plan with a $ 2,000 out of pocket max and an fsa debit card for virtually tax free healthcare   the caveat being if you do n't use your full fsa election you give it up in fact my biggest gripe with the fsa hsa discussion is that anyone feels the need to claim that hsa funds do n't expire at the end of a plan year as though it 's something other than a personal savings account   an fsa is a spending account or arrangement which is an entirely different animal   it would be like claiming that ira funds do n't expire as though they might somehow

banks have to disclose up front the annual percentage rate or interest rate that will be charged if you have an outstanding balance on a credit card however the apr of 19.9 is not charged all at once for example if you had a $ 100 dollar balance on your credit card you would not be charged 19.9 interest or making your new balance instead you would be charged the periodic rate which is one month 's interest you can easily calculate the period rate by dividing the apr by 12 so 19.9 equals per month this means if you had a $ 100 balance you would be charged interest or making your new balance ask the bank or look on the website for a document called cardholders agreement if you ca n't find a link ask them for a copy so you can read all the fine print ahead of time

without knowledge of the special provisions of your loan contract the one with the highest interest rate should be paid first or if one 's fixed payment is much larger than the other and it is a burden then it should be paid first but refinancing may be an option socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible economically speaking i would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades probably exceeding the term of the loan but some caveats must be handled first many would disagree but i finance the way i play poker tight aggressive

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

keep in mind this is an opinion piece the foreign sovereign act would have argentina from virtually all of these suits lets sovereigns opt out of its protections which argentina did argentina waived immunity from suit in new york state or federal court and its immunity from the attachment of its assets within the us to satisfy a judgement    in this particular case it also agreed this issuance of debt would rank with its other debt obligations and without any preference among themselves emphasis added 1994 bondholder agreement this is the clause the court used when deciding whether argentina could pay some bondholders and not others it is fairly that bondholders are all on equal footing it also added that these debt obligations would rank at least equally with argentina 's other unsecured debt    this was not a coincidence by issuing in new york and subjecting itself to new york us law argentina was able to obtain a much more favorable borrowing rate argentina was the of the debt agreement where it promised to treat all borrowers the same and it was the party who waived its inherent under us law it benefited greatly from the substantially lower borrowing costs it enjoyed by doing so    because argentina waived its sovereign the court looked to the language in the contract it states the debt will all be treated the same and will be subject to ny us law it is hard to say it is unfair for a new york court to enforce a contract argentina wrote and then subjected itself to new york jurisdiction law    note three us government agencies sided with argentina justice state treasury claiming should at least partially apply regardless of waiver they made mostly policy arguments about how sovereigns should enjoy at least partial immunity argentina 's debt contract was very liberal with its waiver of sovereign immunity so it is not surprising the court looked to the actual contract when deciding what rights bondholders have

you sold $ 10,000 worth of stock so that money is essentially yours   however you sold this stock without actually owning any which means that you through your broker are currently borrowing shares amounting to at the time of your sale $ 10,000 from someone who actually owns this stock you will be paying this person interest for the privilege of borrowing their shares the exact amount charged varies wildly and depends on factors such as short interest in the stock loads of people want to go short = shareholders can charge high interest etc if i remember correctly hovering over the position column in your portfolio in the ib should give you information about the interest rate charged   you will have to buy back these shares from the lender at some point which is why the $ 10k is n't just free money if the stock has gone up in price in the meantime you are going to be paying more than the $ 10k you got for the same amount of shares and vice versa

the market does n't really need to adjust for fees on etf funds that are often less than 1/10th of a percent the loss of the return is more than made up for by the diversification how does the market adjust for trading fees it does n't have to it 's just a cost of doing business if one broker or platform offers better fee structures people will naturally migrate toward the lower fees

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

gt if the state does n’t do it will it not happen   correct if the government state does n't provide health care then the poor are less likely to get health care   we know that is the case because we can compare the us to european countries   gt do we not want persons to eat because we object to the state raising grain   that does n't make any sense the state does n't need to raise grain in order to let everyone eat   they could buy the grain from companies that raise grain and distribute that for free for example

a cd will give you a higher rate of return   the tradeoff is you can not access your money until the cd matures if you need the ability to get your money you should choose a savings account   if you wo n't use your money for awhile choose a cd right now interest rates are so abysmal you are n't going to get much return with either so i would recommend against locking up your money in a cd

that money has to come from profits tell the fed because they 're focusing on lending amp interest rates   you ca n't look at one part of the equation and claim the totality of a solution has to come from it   and you need to model for an optimal rate of taxation just saying lower taxes are better implies your ideal rate is zero if that 's the case state it and i 'll debate that claim in it 's merits
