why because they can get away with it of course in short why not you may want to read the answers to this similar question my answer is the one accepted by the op who has the money the banks who else i have found that some banks are capable of sending receiving ach transfers faster than others i have accounts in two banks lets call them a and b. if i send money push from a to b it may take several days but if i decide to pull the money from a to b by originating the transaction through my account at b the money arrives the next day so the actual transfer only takes a night one business day its just the direction that matters if the bank has to give the money out it will do all it can including taking 2 3 days for processing to keep the money as long as possible but when another bank charges them they have no choice but to pay by the way bank b behaves better when i send the money from my account at b it arrives to a the next day as well try a similar experiment instead of originating the transaction at the sender bank try to originate it at the receiver bank see how long it takes then for the money to appear on your account after it disappeared from the other one

11 111 looks like the old tax number it is used by the tax office to know who you are it is n't good at all for the spanish company it would even change when you move inside germany   vat ids are not exclusive to but a always has one as freelancers you can get at vat id but you do n't always have to   the tax office offers a small business treatment 19 for freelancers kind of an opt out for the vat id as you do not have a vat id this is probably your case it means so what to do if i were you i 'd write them that according to 19 and the european council directive of 28 november 2006 on the common system of value added tax title chapter 1 special scheme for small enterprises you were not assigned a vat id and vat is not applicable to your bill the fact that vat is not applicable in this case does not mean that they are allowed to refuse payment   i heard a but do n't really know that a number similar to the vat id is planned also for freelancers you could go to your tax office and ask them about maybe that yields a number that satisfies spanish afaik you can go to your tax office and ask them to give you a real vat number   but careful that has the serious drawback that you have to do do an advance vat estimate and pay that to the tax office at least quarterly for bigger business monthly and afaik you are not allowed to change back to the small business treatment for several years

let 's imagine an economy where 100 of wealth creation comes from existing financial assets and 0 comes from new wealth creation that would essentially be a dead economy i do n't think it matters what your philosophy on economics is that 's a bad outcome if you do n't agree with that point we 'll stop here note if you do n't think it 's bad for this to keep going higher japan is at about 80 and we know how they 're doing   if you agree 100 would be bad then we 're 70 of the way there in the us trump 's tax plan if enacted would push us even further the question we should be asking is what is a reasonable way to encourage new wealth creation rather than protect and preserve existing wealth for starters it makes little sense to have a preferential tax rate for capital gains dividends estates as compared to earned income even if you just hate taxes and want them all to be gone i think it 's fairly easy to say if we 're going to have taxes they should not favor income transfer from existing financial assets as compared to earned income   a much more reasonable way to approach this is to say we have a lot of concentration of financial assets in the top of wealth spectrum let 's just level the tax rate so that income from financial assets is taxes at a similar rate to income from work that 's not even an eat the rich proposal it 's just a eat everyone equally proposal all it would do is tax the very substantial gains in stocks at the same rate as the very median gains from working   the fact that taxing income from financial assets at the same rate as work is a controversial idea is to me of a government completely captured by wealthy interests

given that utilizing all the funds available to you drains your retirement and leaves you with very little cushion for unforeseen events as already noted it may be best to use a smaller amount for closing and just deal with the pmi for a couple years pmi is likely less than the taxes penalties incurred from withdrawing a full 20 + closing costs let alone the lost earning on the accounts above your mortgage interest rate but personally i think the stability of significant home equity is worth more than anticipated stock gains i would recommend pulling enough to buy the house comfortably without dipping too deeply in any one area while still paying down your balance to where you can eliminate pmi quickly say 2 3 years your limits for each account are approximately roth iras   traditional iras brokerage non retirement checking things to consider    if you are current on your payments you can request pmi removal once your loan to value drops below 80 it also automatically when it is scheduled to drop below 78 not if it actually has many loans have a 2 year minimum pmi period though regardless of your loan to value ltv changes ltv changes could be from

if we 're including psychological considerations then the question becomes much more complicated will having a higher available credit increase the temptation to spend will eliminating 100 of a small debt provide more positive reinforcement than paying off 15 of a larger debt etc if we 're looking at the pure financial impact the question is simpler the only advantage i see to prioritizing the lower interest card is the float when you buy something on a credit card interest is often calculated for that purchase starting at the beginning of the next billing cycle rather than immediately from the purchase date i 'm not clear on what policies credit card companies have on giving float for credit cards with a carried balance so you should look into what your card 's policy is   other than than paying off the higher interest rate card is better than paying off the lower interest rate on top of that you should look into whether you qualify for any of the following options presented from best to worst

the answer is simple your new job pays more than your old one   as such you 're in a higher tax withholding bracket even with the same number of deductions as before your withholding is computed based on how much you make each pay period and the number of pay periods in the year   so if you were being paid weekly before then it was based on the assumption you made the same amount for every pay period in the calendar year   this is why tax varies from week to week for hourly employees and people being paid overtime   in your new job you 're being paid semi monthly which makes for 24 pay periods rather than the 52 pay periods when you were paid weekly so the amount of withholding in dollar terms is going to be much greater than when you were being paid weekly   add in the fact you 're making $ 2,000 more a month i presume so that 's $ 24,000 a year more   it 's definitely going to bump you into a different earning bracket for taxes so even with the same number of deductions you 're going to pay more now this is n't to say you wo n't be able to recoup some of that at the end of the year when you file your taxes since your current withholding rate may have you over paying   as such you 'll see a nice refund one final note you always have the option of changing your withholding if you like   many people will do that claiming minimal deductions for the first few months of the year to let the maximum withholding take place then they 'll adjust their withholding deductions in the second half of the year to capture more in each paycheck   if done right it makes no difference in the total amount withheld but it does allow the checks at the latter part of the year to be bigger than if withholding deductions were kept the same throughout

first determine the workload he will expect   will you have to quit your other work either for time or for competition   how much of your current business will be into his business if any   make sure to understand what he wants from you   if you make an agreement set it in writing and set some clear expectations about what will happen to your business e.g. it continues and is not part of your association with the client   because he was a client for your current business it can blur the lines second if you join him make sure there is a business entity   by working together for profit you will have already formed a partnership for tax purposes   best to get an entity both for the legal protection and also for the clarity of law and accounting   llcs are simplest for small ventures c corps are useful if you have lots of early losses and owners that ca n't use them personally or if you want to be properly formed for easy consumption by a strategic   most vcs and super angels prefer everybody be a straight c.   again remember to define as necessary what you are contributing to be an owner and what you are retaining your original business which for simplicity may already be in an entity   as part of this process make sure he defines the cap table and any outstanding loans   june and cousin steve might think their gifts to him were loans or equity purchases best to clear this issue up early before there 's any more money in it third with regard to price that is an intensely variable question   it matters what the cap table looks like how early you are how much work he 's already done how much work remains to be done and how much it will pay off   also if you do it expect to be diluted by other employees angels vcs other investors and so on   luckily more investors usually indicates a growing pie so the dilution may not be at all painful   but it should still be on your horizon   you also need to consider your faith in your prospective partner 's ability to run the business and to be a trustworthy partner so you do n't get and to market the business and the product to customers and investors if you do n't like the prospects then opt for cash   if you like the business but want to hedge ask for compensation plus equity   there are other tricks you could use to get out early like forced redemption but they probably would n't help either because it 'd sour your relationship or the first vc or knowledgeable angel to come along will want you to that sort of right it probably comes down to a basic question of your need for cash his willingness to let you pursue outside work hopefully high and your appraisal of the business prospects

gt;when a business entity is so large and powerful its failure threatens the safety and well being of the nation it is based present in   do n't you think we should approach this issue from the other side and say that the government should be enforcing these restrictions pre in other words firms should be prevented from attaining too big to fail status it seems a bit controversial to me for a government to go in after the fact and forcefully break up a private company where was the government beforehand   gt;the government should be able to forcefully break up the company into smaller groups or laws and regulations that promote competition and allow smaller businesses the ability to compete   how is management distributed across the new entities how is intellectual property distributed it is easy to say we should break these companies up but actually breaking them up is a nightmare each of the new companies will need a duplicate management structure and invariably they will have to source outside resources to fill these roles if one firm retains the more valuable management then it has an advantage over the other firm the same goes for intellectual property or any other rare or unique assets shareholders will not receive the same dividend yield from their shares because the two companies once split will lose out on some economies of scale should the government compensate shareholders for the lost value of their shares if not why not and how is this different from the government directly seizing assets of the shareholders even though they have not committed any crime bear in mind nearly every american citizen owns shares in these companies through their retirement funding and so any loss in market cap will affect normal people not just rich investors   preservation   once again i think we need to be asking a different question how did these firms come to exist in the first place its one thing to turn around and plead to the government to break the firms up but it as the government itself which was asleep on the job and allowed the firm to reach this point anyway should we really trust the government who let the firms come into being to break them up again

as far as i understand op seems to be literally asking why regarding the various contracts on various exchanges etc is it that in some cases they are cash settled and in some physically settled the answer is only that the exchange in question happens to offer it that way note that it 's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically and happens in the billions as a daily matter   conversely in cash settled contracts play out each day   both are totally commonplace different businesses or entities or traders would use the two varieties for reasons the different exchanges offer the different varieties ultimately i guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable   there 's no council or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering recall that a given futures contracts market is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company just like burger king sells different products i believe in another aspect of the question op is asking basically   why is there not a futures contract of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts of currency futures which is physically settled rather than cash settled if that 's the question the answer is just whatever nobody 's done it yet   or it may well exist   but it seems extremely unlikely   physically settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the sorry if the question was misunderstood

i agree with this argument finance legal and tax compliance industries are bogus and add dubious value at best the creation of more wealth helps those that created the wealth the most but it oftentimes also does help everyone else as well think steve jobs amp his company 's many creations   but i also believe that if you had a full day and redistributed all the wealth in the us so that each of us had the same amount of money we 'd each roughly have $ if my math is correct then within 1 generation you 'd already see a similar wealth distribution to what we have now most would consume rather than and it would only be a temporary fix   it 's a rarity to find people advocating for changing the system that creates inequality the fed currently being the biggest instead of simply trying to redistribute the results of that system

if you set a savings amount now and leave it totally fixed you 're likely to massively or   what is more likely is that you will adjust either your savings or your retirement expectations as things go along   if it turns out you have $ 10 m 2010 dollars at age 50 perhaps you 'll retire early and if you have $ 10k perhaps you 'll buckle down and work much longer or save much more so i think what you are looking for is an assurance that if you budget to save x% of your salary over n years and you get an after inflation after tax return of y% pa you will eventually be able to retire on an income equivalent to of your working income   it 's pretty easy to calculate that through a future value formula    for instance one set of values that works is saving 20 of income 5 real return 30 years = final income of 66 of working income   or save half your income and within 14 years you can retire and keep spending the amount you were previously spending   resist the temptation to crank up the assumed return until you get the value you want i think it would be great hubris to try to make this very precise   yes probably you will get raises of course there are taxes to take into account probably higher while you 're saving inflation and returns will vary from year to year et   you can guess at them   but they 'll change and there are bigger things that are unpredictable your personal life your health the economic future of your career or industry   i reckon this simple formula is about as good as you will get

are there other options i have n't thought of mutual funds stocks bonds to buy and sell these you do n't need a lawyer a real estate broker and a banker much more flexible than owning real estate edit re option 3 with no knowledge of investing the first thing you should do is read a few books the second thing you should do is invest in mutual funds and/or etfs that track an index such as the ftse graph that was posted index funds are the safest way to invest for those with no experience with the substantial amount that you are considering investing it would also be wise to do it gradually look up dollar cost averaging

the profits that the corporation had to earn to be able to pay you eligible dividends for the dividend tax credit were already taxed and at a somewhat high corporate rate in the case of large public companies with big profits the dividend tax credit which permits an individual to earn a lot from dividends and not pay any personal income tax essentially recognizes that the profit making up the dividend was already highly taxed to begin with via corporate income tax   it aims to eliminate double taxation fwiw if you own and run a small private business in canada and pay yourself a dividend such dividends are considered non eligible i.e. you do n't get as much a benefit from the dividend tax credit since small business corporate income tax rates are much lower

i 'm 39 and have been investing since my very early 20 's and the advice i 'd like to go back and give myself is the following 1 time is your friend compounding interest is a powerful force and is probably the most important factor to how much money you are going to wind up with in the end save as much as you possibly can as early as you can you have to run twice as hard to catch up if you start late and you will still probably wind up with less in the end for the extra effort 2 do n't invest 100 of your investment money it always me to let my cash sit idle in an investment account because the   notion of inflation eating up my money and i felt i was wasting opportunity cost by not being fully invested in something however not having enough investable cash around to buy into the fire sale dips in the market made me miss out on opportunities 3 diversify the bubble taught me this in a big hairy painful way i had this idea that as a i really understood the tech bubble and over invested in tech stocks i just knew that i was on top of things as an industry insider and would know when to jump yeah that did n't work out so well i lost more than 6 figures at least on paper diversification will the ups and downs somewhat and make the market a lot less scary in the long run 4 mind your expenses it took me years of paying huge full service broker fees to realize that those clowns do n't seem to do any better than anyone else at picking stocks even when they do the transaction costs are a lead weight on your returns the same holds true for mutual funds etfs shop for low expense ratios aggressively it is really hard for a fund manager to consistently beat the indexes especially when you burden the returns with expense ratios that skim an extra 1 or so off the top the expense ratio broker fees are among the very few things that you can predict reliably when it comes to investments take advantage of this knowledge 5 have an exit strategy for every investment people are emotional creatures it is hard to be logical when you have skin in the game and most people are n't disciplined enough to just admit when they have a loser and bail out while they are in the red or conversely admit when they have a winner and take profits before the party is over it helps to counteract this instinct to have an exit strategy for each investment you buy that is you will get out if it drops by x% or grows by y% in fact it is probably a good idea to just enter those sell limit orders right after you buy the investment so you do n't have to convince yourself to press the button in the heat of a big move in the price of that investment do n't try to predict tops or bottoms they are extremely hard to guess and things often turn so fast that you ca n't act on them in time anyway get out of an investment when it has met your goal or is going to far in the wrong direction if you find yourself saying it has to come back eventually slap yourself   when you are trying to decide whether to stay in the investment or bail the most important question is if i had the current cash value of the stock instead of shares would i buy it today because essentially that is what you are doing when you stick with an investment 6 do n't invest in fads when you are investing you become sensitive to everyone 's opinions on what investment is hot and what is not if everyone is talking about a particular investment avoid it the more enthusiastic people are about it even experts the more you should avoid it when everyone starts forming investment clubs at work and the stock market seems to be the preferred topic of conversation at every party you go to get out   i 'm a big fan of contrarian investing take profits when it feels like all the momentum is going into the market and buy in when everyone seems to be running for the doors

there may well be several such graphs i expect googling will turn them up but the definition of risk is actually quite important here my definition of risk might not be quite the same as yours so the relative risk factors would be different for example in general stocks are more risky than bonds   but owning common shares in a blue chip company might well be less risky than owning bonds from a company on the edge of bankruptcy and no single risk number can really capture that another example while i can put all my money in short term deposits and it is pretty safe if it grows at 1 so that my investment portfolio can not fund my retirement then i have a risk that i will run out of money before i shuffle off this mortal   how to capture that risk in a single number so you will need to better define your parameters before you can prepare a visual aid good luck

hitting the 25 marginal rate does not mean all of your earnings are taxed at 25 only those that exceed the top of the 15 bracket you can deduct any expenses for upgrading or repairing your apartments those are subtracted from the earnings before tax is calculated as income so you will probably stay in a lower marginal rate property tax will hit you annually and capital gains tax will hit you when you sell them at the end if you already have experience with this business in your home country then this sounds like a good option for you the only caution that i would give you is to find an accountant to help you with your taxes and pay for a consultation before you get started so that you know what to track that will help him her minimize your tax bill

see and the articles linked from it the issue with holding a levered etf past 1 day is that investors expose themselves to path dependency in the underlying the reason for the difference in payouts comes from the fact that the manager of the levered etf promises you a multiple of the daily returns of the underlying to be able to promise you these daily returns the etf manager has to buy sell some of the underlying every day to position himself to have a constant leverage ratio the next day the short video below explains this process in detail for a 2x long etf but the same result holds for a 2x short etf the manager has to buy more of the underlying on a day when the underlying increases in value and sell more of the underlying when the underlying goes down in value

thirty thousand in credit card debt is a big elephant to eat so to speak   but you do it by taking a bite at a time   one positive is that you do not want to borrow from your 401k.   doing so is a horrible idea the first question you have to ask yourself and understand is how you accumulated 30 k in credit card debt in the first place   most people get there by running up a relatively small amount say 5 k and playing the zero transfer game a few times   then add in a late payment and a negative event or two like the car breaking down or a trip to the emergency room and poof a large amount of credit card debt    obviously i have no idea if this is how you got there and providing some insight might help    also your age approximate income and other debts might also help provide more insight   i assume you are still working and under age 59.5 as you are talking about borrowing from your 401k. where i come from is that my wife then girlfriend found ourselves under stifling debt a few years ago   when we married we became very intentional and focused on ourselves of debt and now sit completely debt free including the house   during our debt payoff time we lived off of less than 25 of our salary   we both took extra jobs when we were able   intensity was our key      if i were you i would not refi the house   there are costs associated with this and why would you put more debt on your home i might cash out the annuity provided that there are no negative tax consequences and depending on how much you can get for it   numbers are the key here   however i feel like doing so will not retire this debt the first thing you need to do is get on a written budget   a game plan for spending and stick to it   if you are married your spouse has to be part of this process   the budget has to be fresh each month and each month you and your wife should meet   to deviate from the budget you will also need to have a meeting   my wife and i still do this despite being debt free and enjoying very healthy incomes secondly it is about cutting expenses   cable off   no eating out or vacations   cut back on cell phone plans only basic clothing   gift giving is of the $ 5 variety and only for those very close to you   forget lattes etc   depending on your income i would cut 401 k contributions to zero or only up to the company match if your household income is above 150k year third it is about earning more   ebay deliver pizzas cut grass overtime whatever    all extra dollars go to credit card balance reduction   at a minimum you should find an extra $ 1000/month however i would shoot for   if you can find 2 k you will be done with this in 13 months   i know the math does n't work out for that but once you get momentum you find more how good will it feel to be out from under this oppression next march   i know you can do this without cashing in the annuity or refinancing   do you believe it

i have traded options but not professionally i had n't come across this terminology but i expect it counts how far in the money as an an option is relative to the distinct strike prices offered for the option series a series being the combination of underlying symbol expiration date and option type call put e.g. all january 2015 xyz calls no matter the strike for instance if stock xyz trades today at $ 11 and the available january 2015 xyz calls have strike prices of $ 6 $ 8 $ 10 $ 12 $ 14 and $ 16 then i would expect the $ 10 call could be called one strike in the money the $ 8 two strikes in the money etc similarly the $ 12 and $ 14 calls would be one and two strikes out of the money respectively however if tomorrow xyz moves to $ 13 then the $ 10 previously known as one strike in the money would now be two strikes in the money and the $ 12 would be the new one strike in the money perhaps this terminology arose because many option strategies frequently involve using options that are or near the money so the one strike in or out of the money contracts would tend to be those employed frequently perhaps it makes it easier for people to describe strategies in a more general sense without citing specific examples however the software developer in me dislikes it given that the measurement is relative to both the current underlying price which changes quickly and the strike prices available in the given option series hence i would n't use this terminology myself and i suggest you eschew it too in favor of something concrete e.g. specify your contract strikes in dollar terms especially when it matters

if you mortgage after the fact you will usually pay an extra .25 higher on the interest rate because a cash out refinance is treated as riskier than a new home purchase mortgage you might save enough on the purchase price of the home with a cash offer to make that higher interest rate worth it but in most cases if you are planning to hold the loan for a long time it 's best to get that mortgage at the time of purchase you might be able to get the same deal with an offer that says you will pay cash if there are any problems getting the loan approved

first of all it 's pretty rare that would cash out your entire traditional ira at once when you retire that would incur major taxes and negate much of the tax deductibility benefit instead you 'd want to take distributions of just what you want to live on which are taxed at income rates and let the rest continue to grow tax free until you need want it as to your main question if you do n't expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement then yes roth makes sense but this is a pretty major assumption when you 're working your salary pushes you into higher tax brackets once you 're retired you do n't have as many sources of income it could be mostly distributions from retirement accounts and even coming from a traditional ira a lot of that will be tax free or taxed at a low rate e.g. 15 if when it was earned it would have been taxed at a higher marginal rate e.g. 25 then the traditional ira was a better choice than the roth traditional versus roth if both are options to you with deductibility for the traditional all comes down to tax rate now versus what you expect your tax rate to be in retirement there is no universal answer

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

why simply because it has been mandated as law and so you may have no choice in the matter whether to contribute or not quoting from gov.uk workplace pensions automatic   a new law means that every employer must automatically workers    into a workplace pension scheme if they next even if you think you will work until you die you can still access the money saved in the pension scheme when you attain the required minimum age for withdrawals under your scheme for instance that may be age 55 but it may also vary by scheme becoming fully retired as in stopping all work is not a requirement to access retirement income from your pension scheme in the eyes of a pension scheme retirement is typically when you elect to take your income benefits according to the established rules of the scheme quoting from working past state pension age continuing in work and your workplace pension   if you reached the age at which you can start claiming your workplace    pension scheme you do n't need to stop work in order to claim you have    a number of options including taking some of the pension you 've built    up while continuing to work for the same employer as to why things are set up this way while some younger folk may today expect to continue working until death for a variety of reasons that is n't always possible two typical such reasons are disability and involuntary unemployment i.e. willing and able but still ca n't land the next job moreover plans change young workers with health and vitality may expect they 'll always feel but end up learning otherwise over time and may come to appreciate the savings that were forced upon them the forced savings aspect of state and state sponsored pension schemes are meant to provide some safety net for those later years when it is a strong possibility that one ca n't continue to work the alternative is to be a 100 burden on family and/or society

the rich pay more in taxes it would be hard to cut taxes in a way that did nt help the rich i 'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes i do n't care that much if it helps the rich   edit okay so let 's say you give the top third of the population by income a 1 income tax cut the middle third got a 5 cut and the bottom third got a 10 cut in dollar value the rich are still getting a larger cut simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes   someone made a point about property tax speaking very generally poor people rent and rich people own so a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy because they own more property certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non wealthy simply because they spend more money   but what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy such as with the headline of ops article as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich as i stated above i do n't care that it helps the rich as long as it 's helping the rest of us too and if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than i am by virtue of being rich i 'm not bothered because i can do math

is that basically it trading off between withdrawing anytime vs paying capital gain tax no another significant factor is dividends in an ira they incur no immediate tax and can be reinvested this causes the account value to compound over the years historically this compounding of dividends provides about half of the total return on investments in a non ira account you have to pay taxes each year on all dividends received whether you reinvest them or not so outside of an ira you have a tax drag on both capital gains and dividends

the example you give would clearly be illegal and so unenforceable in court   if a contract contains a clause which is deemed legal but so unreasonable completely unfair it is unenforceable by the court then the court can replace that cause with a more reasonable clause   i think it would be a fairly expensive and likely losing argument to convince a court that this particular contract was unfair   but if you did it would probably mean only a change in the penalty clause to make it reasonable

suppose that i work from home but do not qualify for a business use    of home deduction as i understand it this means i can not deduct    trips from home to another work location e.g. going to a client 's    home or office to do work there i do not think this is true you can not deduct trips to your main business location i.e. you can not deduct trips to your office or client 's location if this is your main client and you routinely work on site however if you only visit your clients on occasion for specific events while doing your routine work at home you can definitely deduct those trips the deduction of the home usage itself has nothing to do with it however there 's a different reason they refer to pub your home must qualify as principal place of business even if it does n't qualify for deduction the qualifications of principal place of business are described in pub if for some personal reason you do not go directly from one location to the other you can not deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second what is not clear to me is what exactly is deductible if there are    significant time gaps within a single day between trips to different    clients you got it right what this quote means is that if you have client a and client b and you drive from a to b you can only deduct the travel between a and b nothing else i.e. if you have 2 hours to kill and you take a trip to the mall you can not deduct the mileage attributable to that trip you only deduct the actual distance between a and b as it would be had you driven from a to b directly the example you cite re first client being considered as the place of business is for the case where your home does n't qualify as principal place of business in this case you start counting miles from your first client and only for direct trips from client to client if you only have 1 client in that day tough luck nothing to deduct also it 's not clear whether between clients would really be    personal reasons since the appointment times are often set by the    client so it 's not as if the delay between a and b was just because i    felt like it there was never the option of going directly from a to    b. that 's what is called facts and circumstances you can argue that you had enough time between meetings to go back to your home office to continue working the irs agent auditing you and you 're likely to get audited will consider that maybe will accept it maybe not if i had a gap like that described above i could save on my taxes by    going to the park or a hamburger stand instead of going home between a    and b but then you would n't be at home so why would it be principal place of business if you 're not there boom lost deduction for the trip to the first client i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state you 're dealing with deductions that are considered red flags for the irs i.e. many people believe that these deductions business use of your home car trigger audits to substantiate business use of your car you need to keep very good track of your travels literally travel log they sell them at staples and make sure to distinguish between personal travel and business travel keep proofs that the meetings took place although keeping a log is a requirement it can be faked so if audited the irs will want to see more than your own documentation a good tax adviser will educate you on all these rules and also clarify the complexities you were asking about here i 'm not a tax adviser so do n't rely on this answer when you 're preparing your tax return or responding to the irs audit in your edit you ask this specifically what i 'm wondering is whether it is possible for a home    to qualify as a principal place of business for purposes of    deducting car expenses but not for the home office deduction the answer is yes deductibility is determined by exclusivity of use among other things but the fact that you manage your business from your kitchen does n't make your kitchen any less of a principal place of business it is non deductible because you also cook your dinners there but it is still nonetheless your principal place of business the pub which i linked to has these qualifications your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if    you meet the following requirements you use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management activities of your trade or business you have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business as you see exclusivity of the usage of your home area is not a requirement here the exclusively and regularly in the quote refers to your business not using any other location and managing it from home regularly i.e. if you manage your business a day in a year that 's not enough for it to be considered principal if you manage your business from your office and your home you can not consider home as principal

if you are interested in a career in algorithmic trading i strongly encourage you to formally study math and computer science   algorithmic trading firms have no need for employees with financial knowledge if they did they 'd just be called trading firms   rather they need experts in machine learning statistical modeling and computer science in general of course there are other avenues of employment at an algorithmic trading firm such as accounting clearing exchange relations etc   if that 's the sort of thing you 're interested in again you 'll probably want a formal education in those areas as opposed to just reading about finance in the news if you edit your question or add a comment below with information about your particular background i could perhaps advise you in a bit more detail edit given your comment i would say you have a fine academic background for the industry   when hiring mathematicians firms care most about the ease with which you can explore and extract features from massive datasets especially time series regardless of what the dataset might represent   an intelligent firm will not care whether you arrive at their doorstep with zero finance knowledge they will want to teach you everything from scratch anyway nonetheless some domain knowledge could be helpful but you 're not going to get more of it from reading any mass market news source whether you have to pay for it or not   that 's because   some non mass market news sources in the industry are   these are subscription only and actually discuss real information that real professional investors care about   they are loaded with industry jargon they 're extremely opinionated and in my opinion they 're useless   i ca n't imagine trying to learn about the industry from them but if you want to spend money for news in order to be exposed to the of the industry then either of these is far better than the financial times   despite requiring a subscription the financial times still does not cover the technical details of professional trading instead of trying to learn from news then i would suggest some old favorites and above all else read everything in the navigation box on the right side under financial markets and financial instruments

if the stock has dropped from $ 10 to $ 2 and now is range trading between $ 2 and $ 3 and you were not able to sell your shares earlier then i would no be holding on to them now as soon as the price hit $ 3 sell them after you have sold them and you noticed the stock still range trading one strategy you could apply is to go long after the price bounces off the $ 2 support placing a stop just below $ 2 then as the price moves up you trail your stop up with the price as it starts getting close to $ 3 tighten your stop if it keeps range trading and bounces off the resistance at $ 3 and you get stopped out you can either go short and reverse the process or wait for it to bounce off the support at $ 2 again one word of warning though the longer a stock range trades the bigger the outbreak out of the rage either up or down will be that is the reason why you should first wait for confirmation that the price has bounced off support resistance before opening a position and secondly why you should use a stop loss to get you out instead of just selling when it hits $ 3 because if it breaks through $ 3 you can continue profiting as it moves up

two different questions is it better to be in debt or to pay off the debt and is it better to have student debt than other debt   any debt needs to be paid off eventually and any debt makes you less flexible so if you have the choice between spending wasting your money and paying off debt i would recommend paying off the debt   the other question is whether having student debt is better than having other debt you need to look at the terms of your student debt pay off the debt with the worst conditions first loan sharks in britain pay day loans must be paid first credit cards debt must go next then general loans depending on your situation you may want some savings as well in case you lose your job for example so if you have $ 8,000 saved and an $ 8,000 student loan you might consider waiting a bit before you pay back the loan no job + $ 8,000 student loan + $ 8,000 in the bank is better than no job + no debt + no money in the bank

when you send money with western union it is essentially a cash transaction   you supply western union with the name of the recipient and a location   your recipient then shows up at a western union office shows some identification and receives cash   at this point the transaction is over   it is impossible to retract it at this point because western union has already handed out cash and they have no way of contacting the recipient any longer this is the reason why you might want to legitimately use western union   it is an instant way to send cash to anyone anywhere in the world   let 's say that your best friend is stuck in a foreign land and desperately needs money   you can give him cash just as fast as each of you can get to a western union office and you do n't even need a local bank account to do so unfortunately however the nature of the service also makes it useful for scammers   you should never use this service to pay for something from someone you do n't know because there are absolutely no safeguards as mentioned by in the comments you can indeed cancel a western union money transfer if you do so before the money is picked up by the recipient   but after they pick it up the cash is gone

as for the letting the wise people only make the decisions i guess that would be a bit odd in the long run especially when you get more experienced or when you do n't agree with their decision what you could do is make an agreement that always 3/4 + of the partners must agree with an investment this promotes your involvement in the investments and it will also make the debate about where to invest more alive fun and educational as for the taxes i ca n't give you any good advice as i do n't know how tax business stuff works in the us here in the netherlands we have several business forms that each have their own tax savings the savings mostly depend on the amount of money that is involved some forms are better for small earnings 80k or less other forms only get interesting with large amounts of money 100k or more apart from the tax savings there could also be some legal technical reasons to choose a specific form again i do n't know the situation in your country so maybe some other folks can help a final tip if your also doing this for fun try to use this investment company to learn from this might come in handy later

for a lease your payment is a function of sale price minus residual value if the car has a low residual value then the lease payments will be higher if it has a high residual value then lease payments will be lower but the purchase price at the end of the lease will be higher potentially even higher than the kbb of the car there is no gaming the system whether you buy now or lease now and buy later you will be paying for the entire car    calculate the payments in both scenarios with appropriate interest rates money factors sale price and residual value this will demonstrate there is no free lunch to be had here also do n't forget that financing the vehicle after a three year lease will probably mean a higher interest rate than if you were to finance it all now with a purchase now you will likely get more favorable financing terms and be able to talk them down on sale price leasing will not allow such flexibility generally    tldr no that 's not how it works if you plan on owning the car for the duration of a loan e.g. 5 years it will be cheaper to just finance now

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

if one wants to have a bound on the loss percentages that are acceptable this is would be a way to enforce that for example suppose someone wants to have a 5 stop loss but does n't want this to be worse than 10 as if the stock goes down more than 10 then the sell should n't happen thus if the stock opened in a gap down 15 one day this triggers the stop loss and would exit at too low of a price as the gap was quite high as i wonder how familiar are you with how much a stock 's price could change that makes the prices not be as continuous as one would think at least this would be my thinking on a volatile stock where one may want to try to limit losses if the stock does fall within a specific range

first to answer the question   the benefit of a 401k is that you do n't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates   you get that with the restriction that you ca n't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account and you are taxed on withdrawals more severely if you do it before you are 65   similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits   now for the 7000 not providing benefit   assuming a very modest 4 growth over 40 years 7000 becomes not something to sneeze at inflation risk reward blah blah blah it is less than it looks but 4 is really pretty low the stock market averages anywhere from and iirc the bond market is somewhere around 5   now certainly to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw   however if it is possible you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account   the penalties and lost earning opportunities are pretty significant   /u has the r finance for how much you lose by doing an early withdraw   do n't do this lightly and i would suggest avoiding cashing out the whole thing if you can

i do n't even know where to begin you 're truly all over the place the number of upvotes on your post has absolutely zero relevance to the fact that you believe trump has caused this minuscule reduction in the deficit you literally said it yourself you posted an article and stated let 's discuss and then when it was discussed your argument was completely refuted in a heartbeat why did n't you respond to 's post he laid out a rational argument to refute your opinion however you unfortunately did n't have the facts or understanding on the subject to back your opinion so instead you stayed away from that comment argument because it did n't reflect your biased way of thinking this is the basis of which the shrinking pro trump base now stand they project their opinions then cherry pick the feedback that helps them feel good about their opinions while refusing to respond to any arguments that have factual information amp merit   i 'm going to give you some advise is n't a good place for you to learn about the basics of economics and i know you do not know the bare basics because anyone with any clue about how modern economics works knows that a president can not enact true economic growth or can significantly reduce a national budget deficit in 8 months while not introducing amp passing one piece of meaningful legislature or enacting any piece of their economic agenda which both sides of the aisle are fully aware amp accept that trump has n't been able to accomplish yet   now this is going to put you in a tough spot the s&amp;p under obama was up 30 after his first 8 months in office by your rational obama grew the overall wealth of the top 500 companies in the u.s. by 30 before he was able to enact any legislature but no obama could n't have done that because he only introduced destructive economic legislature from the get go therefore the president must have no control over economic success or failure within their first year of the presidency before they can make use of their economic agenda however that would go against your entire argument you set forward in this post puts you in a bit of a    sorry for the long response it 's just tough seeing someone make repeated simple basic economic mistakes in the subreddit feel free to pm me if you 're looking for some good books to get you started

in a business environment this phenomenon could be easily explained by operational leverage operational leverage is the principle that increasing revenues by a small amount can have a disproportionately large impact on net income consider this example you run a business that rents out a factory and produces goods to sell to consumers the rent costs you $ 10k month and all of your other costs depend on how many goods you produce assume each good gives you $ 10 in profit after factoring your variable costs if you sell 1,000 units you break even because your variable profit will pay for your rent if you sell 1,100 units you make $ 1,000 net profit if you sell 1,200 units you double your overall profit making $ 2,000 for the month operational leverage is the principle that adding incremental revenue will have a greater impact than the revenue already received because your fixed costs are already paid for similarly in personal finance consider these scenarios you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,000 your monthly savings and therefore your wealth will be zero   you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,100 your monthly savings will be $ 100 per month you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,200 increasing your income by ~10 has allowed your monthly savings double at $ 200 per month you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 2,000 your monthly savings are 5 times higher when your income only increased by now in the real world when someone makes more money they will increase their expenses this is because spending money can increase one 's quality of life so the does not happen quite so quickly as pointed out by there comes a point where increased spending provides someone with less increase in quality of life at that point savings really would quickly ramp up as income increases incrementally but assuming you live the same making $ 2,000 month as $ 1,000 month you can save every month a full month 's worth of living expenses this does n't even factor in the impact of earning investment income on those savings as to why the wealth exceeds income at that specific point i could n't say but what i 've outlined above should show how it is quite reasonable that the data is as reported

two different takes on an answer the net loss concept you mentioned and a core business concept if a store is actually a net loss and anybody is willing to buy it it may well make sense to sell it   depending on your capital value invested and how much it would take you to make it profitable it may be a sound business decision to sell the asset   the buyer of the asset is of course expecting for some reason to make it not a net loss for them perhaps they have other stores in the vicinity and can then share staff or stock somehow the core business is a concept   investors seem to go in cycles like can like well diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector but then they also like so called pure play companies where you are clear on what you are owning   to try an example which is likely not the case here lets say that in 5 of its stores had migrated away from a gas station model to a one stop gas and repairs model therefore they had to have service parts and trained staff at those locations   these things are expensive and could be seen as not their area of expertise selling gas so as an investor if i want to own gas stations i do n't want to own a full service garage so perhaps i invest in somebody else once they sell off their non core assets they free up capital to do what they know best it is at least one possible explanation

from what you have typed up this is very impressive i would not be surprised if you could squeeze another 50,000 100,000 out of this car honda has a good reputation for making reliable cars also from your post you mentioned that your are not too car savvy dealership repair are usually unnecessary after the car is off warranty reason being that most if not all repairs will be 2 3x more than a good reputable local shop also many aftermarket parts are just as good if not better than dealership car parts and not to mention that with the options are endless parts are easy to come by buying a new car has some benefits but usually it ends up being more expensive to go new vs maintaining an older car at this point in time you can save the most money by finding a local reputable shop to do your repairs there is no point in going with the dealer also if you are using regular motor oil not synthetic you do n't need to change it every 3,000 miles like the dealer says oil technology has improved so much that you can go 5,000 miles with no problem just make sure your oil level it topped off i will say this though anything electrical that is an issue is a good reason to get rid of the car

for the most part saving money usually depends upon having a budget and being able to stick to it the toughest part of budgeting is usually setting it up how much do i need for x and sticking to it each month in regards to sticking to it there is software that you can use that helps figure out how much you are spending and how much you have left in a given category and they all pretty much do the same thing track your spending and how much you have left in the category if you are good with spreadsheets you might prefer that route cost free but software that you can buy usually has value in that it can also generate reports that help you spot trends that you might not see in the spreadsheet sticking to a budget can be tough and a lot of what people have said already is good advice but one thing that helps for me is having play money that can be used for whatever i want in general this should be a fairly nominal amount $ 20 or $ 40 a week but it is enough that if you see a new book you want or what to go out for lunch one day you can do it without impacting the overall budget in some way likewise having bigger savings goals can also be useful in that if times get tough it is easier to stop putting $ 100 a month to the side for a vacation than it is to cut back your grocery budget

unless you suffer from the illusion that you can time the market it honestly does n't matter much the difference is lost in the noise that may be true even if you do suffer from that illusion   also as discussed here previously the drop in a stock 's price right after the dividend has been paid just reflects the fact that you are n't about to get an immediate refund in the form of a dividend if you look at the real cost per share it 's meaningless and can should be ignored buying after the dividend is paid may save you a tiny fraction of a cent of short term income tax but that 's meaningless in real terms

you can not determine this solely by the ticker length however there are some conventions that may help steer you there nasdaq has 2 4 base letters bats has 4 base letters nyse equity securities have 1 4 base letters nyse mkt formerly amex have 1 4 base letters nyse arca has 4 base letters otc has 4 base letters security types other than equities may have additional letters added and each exchange and data vendors have different conventions for how this is handled so if you see t for a us listed security it would be only be either nasdaq nyse or nyse mkt if you see then you can not tell which exchange it is listed on   in this case networks is actually a nyse stock for some non equity security types such as hybrids and debt instruments some exchanges add p to the end for nasdaq and otc and nyse nyse mkt have a variety of methods including not adding anything to the ticker   examples include nyse nasdaq   it all becomes rather confusing given the changes in conventions over the years essentially you require data that provides you with ticker listing location and security type the exchanges allocate security tickers in conjunction with the sec so there are no overlaps   eg the same ticker can not represent two different securities however tickers can be re used   for example the ticker ab has been used by the following companies

depends on the stock involved but for the most part brokerages allow you gain entry at 50 meaning you can short twice the cash on hand you have    going forward you need to maintain 30 so on a $ 10,000 short you 'd have to maintain $ 3000 in your account example an account with $ 5000 cash you can short $ 10,000 securities   let say 100 shares of xyz at $ 100 per share after trade settles you wo n't receive a margin call until your balance falls to $ 3000 probably right around the time xyz rises to $ 120 per share   riskier stocks will have higher margin maintenance requirements leveraged vehicles like triple leveraged require 90 margin if they are allowed to be shorted at all

great topic as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank in the simplest form an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties    say party a has a $ 100 loan with a fixed 4.25 interest rate and party b also has a $ 100 loan with a variable rate lets say prime plus 1 prime is 3.25 so b is also paying 4.25    party a thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense while party b is a small company and does n't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget   party a and b agree to enter into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of $ 100 where party a agree to pay b prime plus 1 fixed for floating and party b agrees to pay a 4.25 floating for fixed for some period of time they agree upon usually the maturity of the loan   now from the start the swap has a market value of $ 0 since a and b both receive the same as they are paying as interest rates move the value of the swap moves say interest rates fall and prime is now 2 b still pays 4.25 to a he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25 no matter what and a only pays 3 prime plus 1 to b. remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change so a owes $ 4.25 to his bank and b owes $ 3 to his bank party a uses the $ 4.25 from b to pay his bank and pays $ 3 to b. party a has lowered his interest expense by $ 1.25 and his position is considered in the money which means he is benefitting from the transaction party b gets $ 3 from a but still owes his bank $ 4.25 in reality the transaction nets out to b paying a $ 1.25 rather than both a and b paying each other different amounts b is out of the money because in aggregate he is paying a. the market value of the swap would be the present value of that $ 1.25 benefit a receives discounted using expected future interest rates the same number but negative is the value to b   please ask if you have additional questions or need

yes an index is by definition any arbitrary selection in general to measure performance there are 2 ways by absolute return meaning you want a positive return at all times ie 10 is good -1 is bad by relative return this means beating the benchmark for example if the benchmark returns -20 and your portfolio returns -10 then it has delivered + 10 relative returns as compared to the benchmark

there are three or four ways that a company can grow crowdfunding is a relatively new in mainstream businesses alternative financing method where people will finance a company with the expectation that they will benefit from the product or service that they provide obviously a startup has no prior income to use so it must either raise money through equity or debt people say that one must borrow contingent on their salary banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest   for individuals their income is their primary source of cash flow so yes it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan   for a business the key factor is future cash flows   so a business will borrow money say to buy a new asset like a factory that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt   if the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest they 'll loan the money equity investors are essentially the same but since they do n't get a guaranteed payback they only get paid through non guaranteed dividends or liquidation their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns so the question i 'd have as a bank or equity investor is what are you going to do with the money   what is your business strategy what are you going to do that will make profits in the future   do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business   crowdfunding would be similar people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service so any business either starts small and grows over time which is how the vast majority of businesses grow or has some special idea asset skill or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan i know again that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes the unfortunate reality is that most startups fail   which may sound bad but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are ok with failing   they are people that are willing to fail 9 times with the thought that the 10th one will take off and make up for the losses of the first 9    so i would say if you have some great idea or skill and a viable strategy and plan to take it to market then go for it you do n't need a huge salary to start off   you need something that you can take to market and make money   most people myself included either do not have that idea or skill to go out on their own or do n't have the courage to take that kind of risk   but do n't go in assuming all you need is a loan and you 'll be an instant millionaire   you might but the odds are very long

your heart is in the right place especially since they 've got a kid if you really want to help them have the uncomfortable conversation with them that they need to have about money specifically how to develop and stick to a budget it is a painful but valuable lesson for life   depending on what type of relationship you have with them you can approach it in different ways just giving them friendly advice is perhaps the touch you could have but might not make the impression you need   if they are asking you for money i would personally make it a condition that they work through their personal budget with you and then start living within that budget if you 're lending money it 's not too much to ask to follow their accounts or finances so that you can see that they 're on the right track if you 're a close enough friend you could really walk them through it and help them to develop the habits of estimating how much they will earn in a month estimating how much they should spend in a month   tracking how much they are actually spending and   comparing how much they actually earn with how much they actually spend   doing this every month until they get out of the weeds they should at least do it every 3 months when they 're in good financial shape but even then each month does n't hurt setting them up with something like mint.com if they 're in the us would be a handy place to start you can share the login information with them if they trust you and then they can change it once whatever agreed upon terms come around   it sounds weird i know but i have helped two friends out of credit card debt this way the hardest part is getting around the discomfort taboo shame of them knowing they need help and not wanting to accept it

ok this gives us something to start on i am owner of a company that our best selling product is government designed    your position is that there is no profit incentive if government invests in a company i know from first hand experience that is not true if government were funding your whole company and you as an owner had no skin in the game then yes that would be true however that is not what government does i have experience from receiving government grants for our own innovation as well as receiving the right to sell a government designed product    our company competes with a number of other companies that do the same this investment in our work has given our company a great boost which has lead to other ideas and inventions as well as growth and expansion the end user has gotten the benefit of that too as the government is n't really good at mass production and sales but we are however if the government had n't made this investment we would still be doing what we are doing it would have just taken us a little longer to get here    you other position is that they only listen to special interests who would like it if the project is as expensive as possible there is some truth to that and there are definitely projects where we have seen that but that is more the exception than the rule what usually happens is eventually these companies piss off an end user who receives the product which is the result of these bloated contracts when it gets bad enough people run to their representatives and there is a major investigation i know of a couple of people who have spent time in the federal including the owner of another small business in the city where my company is a lot of times these companies are banned or are moved to the fringe where they go into a death spiral    competition is the of capitalism and our company has grown and succeeded because we pick up business all the time from larger companies who bloat and laziness has caused them to be noncompetitive

i suggest that you use your own judgement on this you can assign a reasonable percentage since it is impossible to monitor the hours using those assets example 40 personal and 60 for business it 's really your call i also suggest that you should be conservative on valuing the assets record the assets at it 's lowest value this is one of the most difficult scenarios in making your own financial statements you can also use this approach i will record the assets at its original cost then use a higher depreciation rate or double declining method of depreciation if the assets have a depreciation rate of 20 per year useful life of 5 years i will make it 30 the other 10 will add more expense and helps you not to overstate your financial statement you can also use the residual value of the asset but if you do this you should figure out the reliable amount i understand that this is not for tax reporting purposes therefore there 's no harm if you overstate your financial statement and even if you overstate you can still adjust the cost of the asset along the way in the middle of the year or year end you will figure out the cost of the asset if it 's over valued once the financial statement is done

brokerages offer you the convenience of buying and selling financial products they are usually not exchanges themselves but they can be typically there is an exchange and the broker sends orders to that exchange the main benefit that brokers offer is a simpler commission structure not all brokers have their own liquidity but brokers can have their own allotment of shares of a stock for example that they will sell you when you make an order so that you get what you want faster regarding accounts at the exchanges to track actual ownership and transfer of assets it is not safe to assume that s how that works there are a lot of shortcomings in how the actual exchange works since the settlement time is 1 3 business days depending on the product so upwards of 5 to 6 actual days in a fast market the asset can change hands many many times making the accounting completely incorrect for extended time periods better to not worry about that part but if you 'd like to read more about how that is regulated look up failure to deliver regulations on short selling to get a better understanding of market it is a very antiquated system

if it helps you to think about it long is equivalent to betting for the upside and short is equivalent to betting for the downside if you are long on options then you expect the value of such options to increase   if you are long an option then you own the option   if you are short an option then generally you sold the option   someone who is short a call sometimes called the writer or occasionally the issuer has sold a call option to someone who is now long a call buying a call option that will increase in value is itself a form of investment just as it 's investment to buy stock or other instruments hoping they will appreciate in value   an option 's value will rise or fall with the underlying so being long an option is a way to be long in the underlying   someone can be long in a stock by buying the stock or long in a call by buying call options in the stock   the long call generally requires less initial investment than buying the underlying and lets the option holder avoid the asset downside during the option term   the risk is that the asset may not appreciate to the point that the call option will pay off in the conceptual sense a share of stock is a particular right to the profits and assets of a corporation both in form of dividends and in liquidation   an option is a particular right to the the share of stock   it 's just a further way to formalize and the various property rights that exist in a corporation   if you can buy a piece of paper with particular rights to corporate profits and assets then you can buy another piece of paper with particular rights to the former piece of paper

credit card fraud is an extremely to stress extremely small proportion of total credit card transactions   the card issuing entities all offer zero fraud liability even on debit cards   there are millions of transactions every day and fraud loss just is n't worth developing and supporting an additional authentication layer that faces the consumer to be clear the downside is cost   cost to develop cost to implement cost to maintain cost to support   all of this to stop something that millions of people have yet to even experience

first you need to be aware that the credit score reported by mint is equifax credit score equifax credit score like fico vantagescore and others is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available   every score is calculated with a different formula and can vary from each other widely   lenders almost exclusively only use fico scores so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use second understand that the advice you see from places like mint and credit karma will almost always tell you that you do n't have enough credit card accounts   the reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications   they have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards finally realize that credit score is just a number and is only useful for a limited number of things   higher is better to a point and after that you get no benefit from increasing your score    my advice to you is this do n't stress out about your credit score especially a free score reported by credit karma or mint   if you really have a desire to find out your score you can pay fico to get your actual score but it 's not cheap   you can also sometimes get your fico score by applying for a loan and asking the lender   i last saw my fico scores there were three one from each credit bureau when i applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free   but honestly knowing your score does n't do much for you as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait do n't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry   the thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time   despite what you commonly read about credit scores i 'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts   at the time i applied for my last mortgage i only had 2 open credit cards still true and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old   the average of my 3 scores was just over 800   but i 've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now   only get credit cards that you actually want and close the ones you do n't want

unfortunately in this market environment your goal is not very realistic at the moment real interest rates are negative and have been for some time   this means if you invest in something that will pay out for sure you can expect to earn less than you lose through inflation   in other words if you save your $ 50 k when you withdraw it in a few years you will be able to buy less with it then than you can now you can invest in risky securities like stocks or mutual funds   these assets can easily generate 10 per year but they can and do also generate negative returns   this means you can and likely will lose money after investing in them   there 's an even better chance that you will make money but that varies year by year   if you invest in something that expects to make 10 per year meaning it makes that much on average it will be extremely risky and many years it will lose money perhaps a lot of it   that 's the way risk is   are you comfortable taking on large amounts of risk good chances of losing a lot of your money you could make some kind of real investment   $ 50 k is a little small to buy real estate but you may be able to find something like real estate that can generate income especially if you use it as a down payment to borrow from the bank   there is risk in being a landlord as well of course and a lot of work   but real investments like that are a reasonable alternative to financial markets for some people another possibility is to just keep it in your bank account or something else with no risk and take $ 5000 out per year   it will only last you 10 years that way but if you are not too young that will be a significant portion of your life   if you are young you can work and add to it unfortunately financial markets do n't magically make people rich   if you make a lot of money in the market it 's because you took a risk and got lucky   if you make a comfortable amount with no risk it means you invested in a market environment very different from what we see today edit to get an idea of what risk free investments after inflation earn per year at various horizons see this table at the treasury   at the time of this writing you would have to invest in a security with maturity almost 10 years in order to break even with inflation   beating it by 10 or even 3 per year with minimal risk is a pipe dream

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

edit quid identified the reverse split in may 2017   in a reverse split your shares are worth 7 times as much per share but you have the amount of shares   a share worth $ now was worth all else being equal $ a month ago    so a call with a $ 2.50 strike a month ago was well out of the money and would now be the equivalent of a call with a $ strike   a $ call with a $ underlying or a $ 2.50 call with a $ underlying would reasonably be worth only 5 cents so i now suspect that the quote is a stale quote that existed pre split and has n't been adjusted by the provider old answer i can find no valid reason why those calls would be so cheap   the stock price has been trending down from its onset in 2000 so either no one expects it to be above $ 2.50 in a month or it 's so illiquid that there 's not any real data to evaluate the options   they did pay some massive 30 dividends in 2010 and 2012 they 've been cash for the past 4 years at least and i have found at least on strong sell rating so there 's not much to be optimistic about   nasdaq does not list any options for the stock so it must be an otc trade    with an ask size of 10 you could buy calls on 1,000 shares for $ 0.05 so if you can afford to lose $ 50 and want to take a flyer you can give it a shot but i suspect it 's not a valid quote and is something that 's been manufactured by the option broker

in fact markets are not efficient and participants are not rational that is why we have booms and busts in markets emotions and psychology play a role when investors and/or traders make decisions sometimes causing them to behave in unpredictable or irrational ways that is why stocks can be undervalued or overvalued compared to their true value   also different market participants may put a different true value on a stock depending on their methods of analysis and the information they use to base their analysis on this is why there are always many opportunities to profit or lose your money in liquid markets doing your research homework or analysis can be related to fundamental analysis technical analysis or a combination of the two for example you could use fundamental analysis to determine what to buy and then use technical analysis to determine when to buy to me doing your homework means to get yourself educated to have a plan to do your analysis both fa and ta to invest or trade according to your plan and to have a risk management strategy in place most people are too lazy to do their homework so will pay someone else to do it for them or they will just speculate on the latest hot tip and lose most of their money

yes the interest rate on a treasury does change as market rates change through changes in the price but once you purchase the instrument the rate you get is locked in the cashflows on a treasury are fixed so if the market rate increase the present value of those future cashflows decreases so the price of the treasury decreases if you buy the bond after this happens you would pay a lower price for the same fixed cashflows hence you will receive a higher rate note that once you purchase the treasury instrument your returns are locked in and guaranteed as others have mentioned also note that you should distinguish between treasury bills and treasury bonds which you seem to use interchangeably straight from the horse 's mouth treasury bills are short term securities with maturity up to a year treasury notes are medium term securities with maturity between 1 and 10 years and treasury bonds are anything over 10 years

the editorial highlights some reasonable consistent and transparent and then seemingly takes a left turn this concept or cutting out the middle man is a fantasy born of a time when local doctors provided affordable but limited care to a limited population it 's been a hollow talking point perpetuated by industry lobby in response to single payer proposals keeping health care between patient and doctor does n't address the key reasons why health insurance exists in the first place    the author suggests government funded escrow accounts for those who ca n't afford the cost of healthcare what about those just above the needs tested cutoff it seems that this approach and therefore punishes the middle class must those with chronic illness become indigent before the government will assist in their care the point of insurance is that when you get sick you are n't left spending your life savings on medical care level and transparent pricing does n't change the fact that certain treatments are still going to be expensive the auto insurance comparison always frustrates me because people are not cars if your car is breaking down every 30 miles you can take out a loan and get a new car a new body not so much furthermore every auto insurance claim raises your premium all of this amounts to a tax on sick people    single payer or even medicaid for all who want it means the government has enormous pool of patients or consumers if you wish with which to negotiate pricing do you really think st. xyz hospital is going to cut you an individual a deal for no reason where is the leverage particularly in the case of emergencies   it is n't perfect but and the tragic case of a brain dead infant does not strengthen your argument charlie 's case was not a matter of death panels it was a matter of parents in denial that their children was not going to get better it 's indeed an ethical and no doubt a tragedy but the of the situation was not dictated by a heartless government but by health care professionals    this is much more than i wished to say initially but i am tired of seeing simplified fantasy being sold as panacea for what is an extremely complicated subject also i 'm not a public policy scholar but i think i 've done a better job than the author

here 's my view as a old who grew up in auckland when you purchase a residential property whether or not you intend to live in it you 're essentially counting on the possibility that one of the following will occur this report by the nz royal society going by memory from a presentation i attended predicts ongoing population growth in nz mainly driven by immigration and mostly in auckland building of new housing is n't keeping up with population growth so my bet would be that the property values especially in auckland are going to continue to climb   other factors that might influence your decision are things only you can know such as where you might be likely to settle down how much risk you 're willing to take how much capability you have to look after a rental property and how much knowledge you have about the property market bear in mind that government schemes and world events may change the outlook for number of houses being built and immigration levels both of which heavily affect property values my personal view is that the government is n't doing nearly enough to provide affordable housing for our young adults in nz not only that the govt is essentially responsible for the problem in the first place as zoning rules for local authorities artificially inflate land prices which prevent the building of affordable houses furthermore foreign investment in rental properties is unregulated and both these problems could be resolved with appropriate legislation though central city prices are unlikely to be relieved as much as other areas simply because prices are also inflated due to the desirability to live centrally the problem is a severe one and high housing prices for even the smallest are going to make inequality and the social problems that go with it far worse i 'd like to see new cities or towns being planned and built from scratch such as and

you can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer 's 401k e.g. you can buy your employer 's stock at discounted rates within the 401k and this is a good investment according to your friends neighbors and brothers in law you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an ira where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs e.g. mutual fund fees than in a typical employer 's 401k plan on the other hand 401k assets are better protected than ira assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages the plaintiff can not come after the 401k assets if you can not pay   to answer the question of how you need to talk to the hr people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll over from another tax deferred plan not all plans are agreeable to do this and get any paperwork from them especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent and to whom it should be payable then talk to your previous employer 's hr people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer fill out the paperwork make sure they know to whom to cut the check to and where it is to be sent etc in my personal experience i was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new ira account and i had to send it on to the custodian my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian the following january you will receive a 1099-r form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax deferred account

i 'm being realistic they 're dumping tens of millions of dollars into an operation that shows no real signs of earning any kind of profit in anything that approaches the short or medium term they 're making expensive cars at ferrari volumes for bmw prices in limited markets while the major automakers introduce more and more electric and hybrid cars once mercedes and ford and honda have full electric cars on the road serviced and backed by their huge network of dealerships what does tesla offer anyone toyota is happy they pumped a relatively small amount of money into tesla and have all but locked up rights to their ip should the company go bust   tesla is trying to capitalize on being first to market but they 're in a kind of catch 22 there is n't huge demand for electric cars right now which means they wo n't be able to sell the volumes they need to grow their business and return a profit as soon as the market is large enough for them to make a profit the big guys are going to catch up and run them over who 'd buy a model s when they could get an electric 5 series for the same money who 'd buy a tesla roadster if they could get an electric or 911

yes an estate plan can be very important   estate planning typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in in general your estate includes all of your assets less all debt plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust the biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or prevents you from acting for yourself in addition tax is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates to create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney when you consult with an estate planning attorney the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax strategies that would be appropriate and appealing what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of and any complicating family issues to deal with these issues your attorney will need full and accurate information about you including when an estate plan is created be sure you understand what the attorney is saying estate planning ideas can be confusing it is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorney 's fee for any legal service some articles and resources get ahead of your estate planning estate planning by cba

the value of an option has 2 components the extrinsic or time value element and the intrinsic value from the difference in the strike price and the underlying asset price with either an american or european option the intrinsic value of a call option can be locked in any time by selling the same amount of the underlying asset whether that be a stock a future etc   further the time value of any option can be by delta hedging the option i.e. buying or selling an amount of the underlying asset weighted by the measure of certainty delta of the option being in the money at expiry instead the extra value of the american option comes from the financial benefit of being able to realise the value of the underlying asset early for a dividend paying stock this will predominantly be the dividend but for non dividend paying stocks or futures the buyer of an in the money option can realise their intrinsic gains on the option early and earn interest on the profits today but what they sacrifice is the of the option   however when an option becomes very in the money and the delta approaches 1 or -1 the discounting of the intrinsic value i.e. the extra amount a future cash flow is worth each day as we draw closer to payment becomes larger than the theta or time value decay of the option then it becomes optimal to early exercise abandon the optionality and realise the monetary gains upfront for a non dividend paying stock the value of the american call option is actually the same as the european the spot price of the stock will be lower than the forward price at expiry discounted by the risk free rate or your cost of funding this will exactly offset the monetary gain by exercising early and banking the proceeds however for an option on a future the value today of the underlying asset the future is the same as at expiry and its possible to fully realise the interest earned on the money received today hence the american call option is worth more for both examples the american put option is worth more slightly more so for the stock as the stock 's spot price is lower than the forward price the owner of the put option a higher intrinsic profit from selling the stock at the higher strike price today than waiting till expiry as well as realising the interest earned liquidity may influence the perceived value of being able to exercise early but its not a tangible factor that is added to the commonly used maths of the option valuation and is n't really a consideration for most of the assets that have tradeable option markets it 's also important to remember at any point in the life of the option you do n't know the future price path you 're only modelling the distribution of probable outcomes what subsequently happens after you early exercise an american option no longer has any bearing on its value this is now zero whether the stock subsequently crashes in price is what is relevant is that when you early exercise a call you give up all potential upside protected by the limit to your downside from the strike price

a company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued share price and strike price both at $ 1 what country is this related to    i ask because in the us most people i know associate a call option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares    so 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares which exceeds the number of shares you 're saying the company has    i do n't know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air or whether it means you 're thinking of a different type of option perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees   each one of those is equivalent to a single share   they just are n't called call options in the rest of my answer i 'm going to assume you meant stock options i assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution i do n't think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place   said another way a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock   they then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool rather than outright grants of the stock for various reasons   one of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no us tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock an alternative scenario when the company shares are traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised   in this case the company needs the cash on hand or cash flow to take money from to buy those shares at current prices anyway in either case there is no dilution happening when the options get exercised   any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created    meaning the total number of shares in the company was already pre set at an earlier time   as a result the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock however price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments    this is almost the same thing you 're asking about but it is technically different as to timing if this is the case can this be factored into any option pricing models like black scholes you 're including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling

if john signs the lease he is entitled to stay there for the duration of the lease regardless of the foreclosure status    i would suggest that signing a year lease even by email with the plan to leave as early as possible is a good thing   the key will be to make sure the penalty for leaving early is nothing john does n't know the status of the foreclosure how long it will take who might own afterwards and a lot of other unknowns   the worst case is to be unsure of where you are living sign the lease and be secure for one whole year that you know where you will be living   spend that year finding a new place to live    if the bank does n't offer you clear and obvious ways to submit rent open an account at the bank and deposit the rent there on time you are establishing credibility that you deserve to stay   you still owe the rent so pay it they do n't want to be your landlord but do n't let a bank bully you around

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

the best way to determine how much it will cost you is to call the insurance companies to get a quote from them for all the vehicles that you are planning on purchasing   they will have a set amount depending on the year make model of the car combined with all your personal details like where you live age sex occupation   there are many online sites where you an get quotes as well though talking with a rep may be the better option since you have a lot of questions   if you are still living with your parents you may be able to get a cheaper rate with that company as you might qualify for a multi vehicle discount or combined property vehicle insurance with them   you might also be able to get a better rate since you were probably insured as a secondary driver with that company for several years the cost of your auto insurance will depend also on what type of premium you choose   for instance it will be cheaper if you opt to only purchase 3rd party liability insurance which only covers the cost of repairing the 3rd party 's vehicle ie the person you hit   you may also get discounts for having certain optional safety equipment options like snow tires    you will need to have your insurance purchased and sorted out before you are able to drive your car out of the dealership    for a male with ~10 years driving experience and a clean record   you could probably find something good for about $ 120 a month   of course this depends on the many factors listed above

my wife and i use a digital form of the envelope system we call it a budget we record how much we want to allocate each month to spend for each category of expense in a spread sheet why use prepaid cards why not open a bunch of bank accounts and use debit cards from each if you want to separate the money you could also keep a ledger for each account that you spend from on a smart phone or even in a physical ledger   the reason for the envelope method is that it psychologically hurts some people to physically part with cash once you it in some factor you lose what is the primary touted benefit and it 's no longer the envelope system the secondary benefit that once the budget for one category is gone it 's gone is only as good as the discipline you have to not rob cash from another envelope why is this any easier than the discipline of not debiting beyond the bottom of the ledger so a budget is a digital version of the envelope system once the physical cash is removed from the equation it 's definitely not the envelope system sorry for the contrarian take on this question but i 've never been a fan of the envelope system for many of the reasons you have described i guess i 'm too young for the cash psychology to work for me

yea there is an easy fix   raise the minimum wage   look into how it has changed over the years   cost of living has gone up but wage has not   its almost impossible to live on a minimum wage   compared to a good 40 years ago and adjusted for inflation it was something like 15 17 dollars an hour   if people where paid a real wage then they could afford to purchase other items than just the bare necessities to survive   they need to really learn more about trickle up economics and stop believe that trickle down works

no one is quite sure what happened yet   speculation includes the interesting thing is that gamble stock got hammered as did accenture   both of which are fairly stable companies that did n't make any major announcements and are n't really connected to the current financial instability in greece   so there is no reason for there stock prices to have gone crazy like that   this points to some kind of screw up and not a regular market force apparently the trades involved in this event are going to be canceled edit 1 one thing that can contribute to an event like this is automatic selling triggered by stop loss orders   say someone at citi makes a mistake and sells too much of a stock   that drives the stock price below a certain threshold   computers that were pre programmed to sell at that point start doing their job   now the price goes even lower   more stop loss orders get triggered   things start to snowball   since it 's all done by computer these days something like this can happen in seconds   all the humans are left scratching their heads no idea if that 's what actually happened edit 2 spectrum has a pretty concise article on the topic   it also includes some links to follow edit 3 reuters is now reporting that a trader at reed triggered all of this but not through any wrongdoing edit 4 reed claims they did n't do it   the house financial services subcommittee investigated but they could n't find a smoking gun   i think at this point people have pretty much given up trying to figure out what happened edit 5 the sec still has no idea   i 'm giving up

i would go to the bank and just express the concern that the check sent to you might not fully clear you do n't want to spend it until you 're sure it cleared i 'd ask for a manager to tell you when it will clear then confirm after that date that it 's cleared with the same guy   perhaps someone in the industry can explain how long the bank has before deciding the check is bad 10 days 2 weeks really it should either clear or bounce by the second night   i 'd not risk doing this for anyone anyone i know personally can cash their own check and i 'd not get involved with anyone i do n't know on a financial matter like this edit see littleadv comment below good checks clear fast a forged check has time for the victim to go to the bank and challenge the signature and cashing of the check the victim can have 60 days to do this that 's the issue i am wrong the bank manager could n't confirm the check was good so soon

it certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency   and yes if the bank makes some bad loans it can the problem generally this does not happen though   remember that banks usually have lots of customers and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day so there is usually enough on hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day   they also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default   a bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit making activity e.g. issuing loans and satisfying its account holders in the event of a major withdrawl demand there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency there are regulations that specify a reserve requirement   the bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand so they ca n't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once   regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation if a bank does run into trouble it can take out a short term loan   either from another bank or from the central bank e.g. the us federal reserve   banks do n't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do so if they are regularly borrowing money they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly if all else fails and the bank ca n't meet its obligations e.g. the fed loan fell through the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid   in the us this is what the fdic is for   worst case the bank goes under but your money is safe these protections have worked pretty well for many decades   however during the recent financial crisis all three of these protections were under heavy strain   so one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing   these tests showed that some banks did n't have enough money in reserve   not long after banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money loan it out invest it etc the current financial landscape would change considerably

given the combination of the admitted delays and then the failure of the money to arrive with only their word they have sent it i would be worried that the solicitor is having financial problems and has not really sent your money because they do n't have it this should n't be possible unless they were already acting by not properly client money but that possibility does always exist i would consult the solicitor 's regulation authority for advice as quickly as possible they may not be the right people to initially deal with the problem but they should be able to advise on the appropriate next steps and it might help them match up your problem with any other reports they have received

e spend a small amount of that money on getting advice from a paid financial planner not a broker or someone offering you free advice their recommendations may be biased toward what makes them the most money   a good financial planner will talk to you about your plans and expectations both short and long term and about your risk tolerance would a drop in value panic you even if you know it 's likely to recover and average out in the long run that sort of thing and about how much time and effort you want to put into actively managing your portfolio from those answers they will generate an initial proposed plan which will be tested against simulations of the stock market to make sure it holds up typically they 'll do about 100 passes over the plan to get a sense of its probable risk versus growth potential versus volatility and tweak the plan until the normal volatility is within the range you 've said you 're comfortable with while trying to produce the best return with the least risk this may not be a perfect plan for you but at the very least it will be an excellent starting point until you decide if you ever do decide that you 've learned enough about investing that you want to do something different with the money it 's likely to be better advice than you 'll get here simply because they can and will take the time to understand your specific needs rather than offering generalities because we 're trying to write something that applies to many people all of whom have different goals and time horizons and financial fortitude as far as a house goes making the mistake of thinking of a house as an investment is a large part of the mindset that caused the great recession property can be an investment or a business or it can be something you 're living in never make the mistake of putting it in both categories at once the time to buy a house is when you want a house find a house you like in a neighborhood you like expect not to move out of it for at least five years can afford to put at least 20 down payment and can afford the ongoing costs owning your home is not more grown up or necessarily financially advantageous even with the tax break or in any other way required until and unless you will enjoy owning your home i bought at age because i wanted a place around the corner from some of my best friends because i wanted better noise isolation from my neighbors because i wanted a garden because i wanted to do some things that almost any landlord would object to and because i 'm handy enough that i can do a lot of the routine maintenance myself and enjoy doing it buy a house get a free set of hobbies if you 're into that and part of the reason i could afford this house and the changes that i 've made to it was that renting had allowed me to put more money into investments my only regret is that i did n't realise how dumb it was not to max out my 401(k match   until i 'd been with the company for a decade that 's free money i left on the table

congratulations you are in great shape financially at a very young age   great income nice equity in a home and mostly debt free    it seems like you are looking at taking out a loan of 400 k and to do so you will have to put your own home at risk as you do not have the 80 k cash for a down payment   correct   it also looks like after 2.1 k per year without regard to taxes maintenance bad tenants or vacancies   as such this will likely be a negative cash flow situation   i would say you should plan on a cost   are you okay with that   while your income can probably cover this no problem is that your objective to have this property have a negative return for the next 10 15 years or so for me this is a no   way too much risk for a negative cash flow it is hard to talk to the upside as you did not give any profit predictions and i am unsure of the market    why would you risk your great financial situation with a hail mary attempt to make money   slow down you will get there   save for a few years so there is no need to tap your home 's equity to make a down payment   it would really bother me to owe 600 k on a 121 k salary k

the plan is perfectly valid and legal as tax rules currently stand there is no limit to the amount you can rollover or convert to roth assuming your 401(k is traditional pre tax you 'll have to pay income taxes on the amount you convert above personal exemption + standard deduction which is currently about $ 10k year for single filers the other caveat is you 'll need funds to live off of while your conversion money is for 5 years in your roth ira if you start the conversion while you are still working you 'll be paying taxes on it in your marginal bracket which will negate much of the benefit of the pre tax 401(k if your living expenses are low you can convert about $ 10k year without federal income taxes while living off capital gains from a taxable account which have a 0 rate in the 15   income tax bracket goes up to about $ year

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

your question seems to be making assumptions around investing that investing is only about stock market and bonds or similar things i would suggest that you should look much broader than that in terms of your investments investment types your should consider and include some or all of the following for your investments depending on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc i love ’s explanation of diversification into other asset classes producing a lower risk portfolio excellent all the above need to be considered in this spread of risk depending as i said earlier on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc stock market investment i ’ll focus most of the rest of my post on the stock markets as that is where my main experience lies but the comments are applicable to a greater or lesser extent to other types of investing we then come to how engaged you want to be with your investments two general management styles are passive investment management versus active investment management says   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs    across asset classes and just leave them the difficulty with this idea is that profitability is very dependent upon when the stocks are purchased and when they are sold this is why active investing should be considered as a viable alternative to passive investment   i do n’t have access to a very long time frame of stock market data but i do have 30 or so years of ftse data so let ’s say that we invest £ 100,000 for 10 years by buying an etf in the index i know this is n't de risking across a number of asset classes by purchasing a number of different but the logic still applies if you will bear with me passive investing i have chosen my example dates of best 10 years and worst 10 years as specific dates that demonstrate my point that active investing will usually out perform passive investing from a passive investing point of view here is a graph of the ftse with two purchase dates chosen for maximum effect to show the best and worst return you could receive note this ignores brokerage and other fees in these time frames of data i have    these are contrived dates to illustrate the point on how ineffective passive investing can be depending if there is a bear bull market and where you buy in the cycle   one obviously would n’t buy all their stocks in one tranche but i ’m just trying to illustrate the point active investing let ’s consider now active investing i use the following rules for selling and this is obviously a very simple technical trading system and i would not recommend using it to trade with as it is overly simplistic and there are some flaws and inefficiencies in it so in my simulation   these beat the passive stock market profit for their respective dates summary passive stock market investing is dependent upon the entry and exit prices on the dates the transactions are made and will trade regardless of market cycles active stock market trading or investing engages with the market using a set of criteria which can change over time but allows one ’s investments to be in or out of the market at any point in time my time frames were arbitrary but with the logic applied which is a very simple technical trading methodology i would suggest that any 10 year time frame active investing would beat passive investing

there is more than one kind of tax it is a little confusing because in reality the tax revenues collected by the government are n't earmarked to a particular usage based on where they came from usually well the gov't often claims they do but for all practical matters it all goes in a big bucket so just because a business or individual is n't paying income taxes does n't mean they are n't paying anything for the use of government furnished infrastructure services you are limiting the scope of your question to income taxes which are taxes paid on profits to a business or individual it makes perfect sense that you would n't pay a tax on something you did n't get however you are n't considering taxes that are being paid even by a company that is n't profitable for example consumption taxes employment taxes and other fees that same company paid sales tax on all the supplies it purchased and probably collected paid sales taxes on anything it sold to take one of your examples it paid for its share of using the roads through government imposed taxes on fuel   do n't worry about the government they know how to get theirs they might not pull it from your right pocket but they will make sure to get it from the left

sorry for your loss like others have said debts can not be inherited period in the us however assets sometimes can be made to stand for debts in most cases credit card debt has no collateral and thus the credit card companies will often either sell the debt to a debt collector or collections agency sue you for it or write it off collecting often takes a lot of time and money thus usually the credit card companies just sell the debt to a debt collector who tries to get you to pay up before the statute of limitations runs out that said some credit card companies will sue the debtor to obtain a judgement but many do n't in your case i would n't tell them of your loss let em do their homework and waste time do n't give them any info and consult with a lawyer regarding your father 's estate and whether his credit card will even matter often unscrupulous debt collectors will say illegal things per the fdcpa to pressure anyone related to the debtor to pay do n't cave in make sure you know your rights and record all interactions calls you have with them you can sue them back for any fdcpa some attorneys might even take up such a case on contingency i.e they get a portion of the fdcpa damages you collect do n't pay even a penny this often will extend or reset the statute of limitations time for the debt to be collectable i.e ex if in your state the statute of limitations for credit card debt is 3 years and you pay them $ 0.01 on year 2 you just bought them 3 more years to be able to collect tl;dr ianal most credit card debt has no collateral so do n't pay or give any info to the debt collectors anytime you pay it extends the statute of limitations consult an attorney for the estate matters and if the debt collectors get too aggressive and record their calls and sue them back

of course i know nothing about real estate or owning a home i would love to hear people 's thoughts on why this would or would not be a good idea are there any costs i am neglecting i want the house to be primarily an investment is there any reason that it would be a poor investment   i live and work in a college town but not your college town you like many students convinced to buy are missing a great many costs there are benefits of course there 's a healthy supply of renters and you get to live right next to campus but the stuff next to campus tends to be the oldest and therefore most repair prone property around which is where the bad neighborhood vibe comes from a lot of the value of your property would be riding on government policy could involve drastic cuts to their size in the near future and student loan reform could backfire and become even less available even city politics comes into play when property developers lobby city council to your neighborhood for apartments you could end up either surrounded with cheaper units or possibly eminent i 've seen both happen in my college town if you refuse to sell you could find yourself facing an oddly high number of rental inspections for example so on to the general advice firstly real estate in general does n't reliably increase in value at best it tends to track inflation most of the flipping and such you saw over the past decade was a prolonged bubble which is slowly and reliably tanking    beyond that property taxes insurance pmi and repairs need to be factored in as well as income tax from your renters and if you leave the home and continue to rent it out it 's not a owner occupied property anymore which is part of the agreement you sign and determines your interest rate there 's also risks if one of your buddies loses their job wrecks their car or loses financial aid you may find yourself having to eat the loss or evict a good friend or if they themselves just for an example alcohol poisoning it could land on your homeowners insurance or maybe the plumbing breaks and you 're out an expensive repair finally there are significant costs to transacting in real estate you can expect to pay like 5 6 percent of the price of the home to the agents and various fees to inspections it will be exceedingly difficult to recoup the cost of that transaction before you graduate you 'll also be anchored into managing this asset when you could be pursuing career opportunities elsewhere in the nation take a quick look at three houses you would consider buying and see how long they 've been on the market that 's months of your life dealing with this house in a bad neighborhood

you are already doing everything you can if your employer does not have a 401(k you are limited to investing in a roth or a traditional ira roth is post tax money traditional ira gives you a deduction so it is essentially pre tax money   the contribution limits are the same for both and contributing to either adds to the limit so you ca n't duplicate cnn wrote an article on some other ways to save one thing you may want to bring up with your employer is that they could set up a sep ira   this allows them to set a up to 25 that they contribute pre tax to an ira for everyone at the company that has worked there at least 3 years   if you are at a small company maybe everyone with that kind of seniority would take an equivalent pay cut to get the automatic retirement contribution   note that a sep ira has to apply to everyone equally percentage wise that has worked there for 3 years and the employer makes the contribution not you

the question regarding your snapshot is fine but the real question is what are you doing to improve your situation   as john offered one bit of guidance suggests you have a full year 's gross earnings as a saving target in my opinion that 's on the low side and 2x should be the goal by 35   i suggest you look back and see if you can account for every dollar for the prior 6 12 months this exercise is n't for the purpose of criticizing your restaurant spending or cost of clothes but to just bring it to light often there 's some low hanging fruit in this type of budgeting exercise spending that you did n't realize was so high   i 'd also look carefully at your debt what rate is the mortgage and the student loans by understanding the loans rates terms and tax status e.g. whether any is a deduction you can best choose the way to pay it off if the rates are low enough you might consider funding your 401(k accounts a bit more and slow down the loan payments   it seems that in your 30 's you have a negative net worth but your true asset is your education and future earning potential   from a high level view you make $ taking $ 50 k off the top which after taxes gives you $ 30 k to pay your student loan you are still earning $ 130 k putting you at or near top 10 of families in this country this should be enough to afford that mortgage and still live a nice life   in the end there are three paths earn more why does hubby earn half what you do in the same field spend less or reallocate current budget by changing how you are handling that debt

note that the new zealand cpi in 2014 q2 is 1.6 year on year that is it is the inflation rate from 2013 q2 to 2014 q2 the quarterly change from 2014 q1 to 2014 q2 is 0.3 check out this inflation calculator at the same time the official interest rate in new zealand was just raised on 24th july 2014 by 25 basis points to 3.5 so your savings in the bank at a rate of 4.5 is beating inflation but once you deduct any tax from the interest earned you are just beating the current inflation rate which is not really a good long term investment choice

well i 'm not an expert and you sound pretty credible however i still do n't see anything to back up what your saying in the sources that i 've found   gt active business income can still be earned by foreign subsidiaries if you can prove to revenue canada that it is a real corporation and taxed at better offshore rates if 90 or more of its income comes from third party transactions    this seems to be consistent with my definition   business profits earned by a foreign sub are taxed when profits are repatriated certain tax credits are available for foreign taxes paid and certain dividends out of surplus are tax free to the corporation not individuals      so when foreign sub pays dividends to the parent corp they are still charged repatriation just like in the us   again this sounds consistent with my previous comment canada has a corporate tax rate that is over 10 lower than the us so this is still a very good deal in its own right    maybe you can explain in more detail or provide a source that has some additional detail i also ca n't find any pieces on this or the deal that suggests beneficial repatriation rules

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

this entirely depends on two factors now let 's look at what applecare gives you what it covers is any manufacturing defect it also covers you for phone support as otherwise it 's a $ incident charge even for simple issues it also covers any software issues that you may come across as long as the issues pertain to apple software or the operating system itself what it does n't cover is any damage caused by the user if you snap the corner of the screen drop it spill liquid on it modify it etc then you 're responsible for paying the repair costs if you 're outside of phone support then you 're going to have to pay someone to fix any problems you come across now if we 're to trust this handy study done in 2009 then we can say that the 3-year failure rate for and macbook pros is we could go ahead and say that $ 350 $ 2000 = 17.5 so the chances match up but what 's the likelihood that apple is going to cover the full $ 2000 only under extreme cases are you losing the full $ 2000 theft shock damage etc and those are all cases that apple wo n't cover anyways instead we 're looking at cases such as please keep in mind it has been several years since i worked for apple so these figures may be off so this reduces our possible savings significantly let 's then also look at what the warranty becomes after they fixed a part a replacement part or apple product including a user part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by apple assumes the remaining term of the warranty or 90 days from the date of replacement or repair whichever provides longer coverage for you which means in this case that you have a 90-day warranty after they 've fixed an issue this significantly reduces the likelihood of a same part going bad multiple times in a row therefore the chances of that $ 350 being worthwhile are very much against you even if the system does fail in some way it is likely that the repair would be cheaper than the applecare the chances of running into a repair or series of repairs that pays for the applecare and then some are astonishingly low i would still get it if you were giving it to someone who was significantly lacking in any technology concepts such as a parent or grandparent as they are more likely to utilize the extended phone support especially for smaller things that they might you about

i 'm going to make an educated guess on 1 money markets invest in bonds with a very short time to maturity an mma at a bank will be invested in government bonds yields on these bonds are really low right now thus the yield on that mma is going to be pretty low when you make a deposit in a savings account the bank uses some of that money to lend back out to its customers in the form of car loans mortgages etc these rates are higher so the bank is willing to pay you a bit more than the yield mma so they can use your money for these loans for 2 your time window is short so there are n't really a lot of options for you keeping your money where it is will actually cost you money in fees you can do as i suggested in my comment above close the current savings account that 's hitting you with fees and open a free high yield savings account you might get 1.1 if you average $ 60k in the account over the next 6 months you 'll earn $ 200 250 after taxes you did n't ask about cds but lately shorter term cds are paying less than savings accounts going out to a year will get you just above the rate on a high yield savings account two years just a little more these are outside your goal window so they are n't an option for you

you are faced with a dilemma if you use a 529 plan to fund your education the short timeline of a few years will limit your returns that are tax free most people who use a 529 plan either purchase years of tuition via lump sum when the child is young or they   put aside money on a regular basis that will grow tax deferred tax free some states do give a tax break when the contribution is made by a state taxpayer into a plan run by the state the long term plans generally use a risk profile that starts off heavily weighted in stock when the child is young and becomes more fixed income as the child reaches their high school years the idea is to protect the fund from big losses when there is no time to recover if you choose the plan with the least risk the issue is that the amount of gains that are being protected from federal tax is small if you pick a more aggressive plan the risk is that the losses could be larger than the state tax savings look at some of the other tax breaks for tuition to see if you qualify credits an education credit helps with the cost of higher education by    reducing the amount of tax owed on your tax return if the credit    reduces your tax to less than zero you may get a refund there are    two education credits available the american opportunity tax credit    and the lifetime learning credit who can claim an education credit there are additional rules for each credit but you must meet all    three of the following for either credit if you ’re eligible to claim the lifetime learning credit and are also    eligible to claim the american opportunity credit for the same student    in the same year you can choose to claim either credit but not both    you ca n't claim the if you were a nonresident alien for any part    of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for    federal tax purposes for more information about and foreign    students visit american opportunity tax credit information for    foreign students deductions tuition and fees deduction you may be able to deduct qualified education expenses paid during the    year for yourself your spouse or your dependent you can not claim    this deduction if your filing status is married filing separately or    if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his    or her tax return the qualified expenses must be for higher    education the tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income    subject to tax by up to $ 4,000 this deduction reported on form    tuition and fees deduction is taken as an adjustment to income this    means you can claim this deduction even if you do not itemize    deductions on schedule a form 1040 this deduction may be beneficial    to you if for example you can not take the lifetime learning credit    because your income is too high you may be able to take one of the education credits for your    education expenses instead of a tuition and fees deduction you can    choose the one that will give you the lower tax

that may be true but on the flip side any monkey can increase security simply by preventing people from doing things the people who are worth paying for are the ones that enable people who actually contribute to the core business to work as efficiently as possible without setting up roadblocks that provide incentive for bypass

the key point is from the sentence in your second paragraph for which you have already paid taxes when you receive a dividend or realise a capital gain you get taxed on that then and you should n't have to pay taxes on it again in future so the cost basis gets adjusted to reflect that

here 's an alternative there are hundreds maybe thousands of contract engineering firms job shops in the united states probably hundreds in california alone   they are in the business of doing what your employer wants you to do they know how to do it they have been doing it for decades working with the biggest most established companies in the country   they have forgotten more about providing engineering services to clients and paying the engineers than you can learn in a lifetime call a few of them   set up meetings   budget a few hours for it   you want to talk with the most experienced recruiter in the office the old guy who has been there and done that   explain your situation and tell them that rather than go through all of the headaches yourself you want to investigate the possibility of them handling all the headaches for their usual markup of course   you can probably word this better than i can but you get the idea the shop may or may not be willing to talk about their markup   my personal opinion is that this is perfectly ok   what they make off of you after your rate is paid is their business also talk about what you do and your recommended rate   it would not surprise me to learn that you are currently grossly underpaid and mention that if the client declines you 're going to be available immediately and you 'd certainly be open to working with them   you will see this again   in fact if they have any current leads that you fit you would certainly be interested in hearing about them   they may already have a from another client for which you fit for which the client is willing to pay much more than your current employer if it were me personally i 'd start with and maybe tad technical   these are three of the oldest and best i 'd also hit up ce weekly get a subscription and find some other shops with offices in your area once you have a shop lined up then ask your employer if rather than you setting up a personal corporation they 'd be willing to work with an established contract engineering firm   who does this kind of thing for a living who does this every day who has been doing this for decades   doing this is simpler for everyone and by going through an established firm they avoid having to teach you how to do business with them   they also avoid the risk of having you reclassified by irs as an employee which exposes them to all kinds of legal and financial liability if they say no walk away from them   immediately   they 've just thrown up a huge red flag   this is where the other discussions with the shop come into play

the app market in 2017       1 is saturated    2 is fragmented by millions of suppliers due to low barriers of entry    3 is rewarding free apps over paid apps       so unless you have a solid amount of advertising budget your choices are     1   paid app -&gt small downloads if at all    2   free app + ads + purchases -&gt shitty user experience    3   free app -&gt no to low income

i would n't be turned off due to the difficult of parsing english for a few reasons firstly you do n't have to perfectly parse to find meaning   you can look for keywords and write some algorithms to approximate and of course if you get enough of a statistical advantage and can repeat it you can make money second it probably is n't long before third party software is made available either to do something like this or to provide a framework for it   in fact it probably already is available somewhere   note the influx of silicon valley types to new york as more machine intelligence is applied to trading and journalism thirdly as hinted by the mention above of journalism there 's already software using numerical data to write pretty human articles   some are pretty robotic and you can catch them i noticed one and searched for a key phrase to discover several very much like it each having a different fake author name   this will mean not only a continued improvement of parsing but also more push for more data to be released in machine readable formats such that press releases will be increasingly finally to your idea the keyword approach has been done with some success   try this link and note the additional links on the same topic if you have the time and processing resources you might like to try your idea by training a neural network to find correlations of keywords and phrases that 's important too with trends in the market
