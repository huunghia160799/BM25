one reason a lot of bond etfs like financials are because of how financial companies work   they usually have amazing cash flows due to deposits and fees and therefore have little risk associated with paying their debts in the short term the rest of contains companies with low default risk and good cash flow generation as well this is of course the objective of banks themselves issue a lot of bonds to raise cash to lend for other purposes   banks are intermediary and help make funds liquid for investors and spenders   hope that helped answer your question   if not comment below and i 'll try to adjust the answer to be more complete

for example for my employer i received a signing bonus and a    relocation lump sum separate from that signing bonus the relocation    lump sum is taxed and will appear as income on my w-2 and i can spend    it on anything i want that said should the relocation lump sum count    towards the entry quoted above in form or would it be considered    the same as any other bonus thus allowing me to take a full deduction    for all of my deductible travel expenses the signing bonus and relocation lump sum will appear as regular income on your w-2 you can think of the relocation bonus as something to cover the pain and suffering the cost of moving without needing to send in receipts lets assume that you meet the distance and time tests so there is potential to save money on your taxes lets also put your actual moving expenses as $ 2500 if you have valid moving expenses the irs will allow you to use them to reduce your agi so now you can reduce your agi by the $ 2500   enter the total amount your employer paid you for the expenses listed    on lines 1 and 2 that is not included in box 1 of your form w-2    wages this amount should be shown in box 12 of your form w-2 with    code p. my question is what exact payments from your employer should be    entered here i realize that you can just write the number you get in    box 12 with code p on your w-2 but i 'm curious how they come up with    this number in some cases the company will reimburse you your moving expenses up to a maximum of $ x. for example a maximum of $ 1000 that means you submit receipts for those expenses and they give you a check or add it to your next paycheck the check will either be for the amount on your receipts or the maximum amount whichever is smaller in this situation with actual expenses of $ 2500 and a reimbursement of $ 1000 you can reduce your agi by $ 1500

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

generally yes   rather than ask why are these guys so cheap you should be asking why the big names are so expensive marketing spend plays a big role there getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage it 's unlikely that you 'll see a scam a brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons but that 's what investor insurance is for is mostly the likelihood that you 'll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker investment funds are insured by sipc for up to $ 500,000 with a lower limit on cash the specific limits vary by broker with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime check with the broker it 's usually on their web pages under security funds in cash might be swept into an interest earning investment vehicle for which insurance is different and that depends on the broker too a few forex brokers went bankrupt last year although that 's a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders i heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there and that there was a ponzi ish scam company as well luckily the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors if you want to assess the reliability of an online broker i suggest the following it 's tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded fly by night scams by definition wo n't be around very long and usually that means under a few months any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface their backend databases and the interface with the markets and their clearing house the two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 + years so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model that said there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need and in that case definitely look into their registrations and third party reviews finally note that the smaller independent brokerages will probably have margin rules if you 're playing a complex novel and/or high risk strategy that ca n't handle the volatility of a market crash even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend did n't exist

you get paid interest on deposits because banks only keep a fraction of the deposits on hand the rest is put to other uses such as loaning money to others if you deposit money and yield 1 interest the bank is able to fund an auto loan at 5 by saving you are actually making more capital available in the marketplace fixed or durable assets like gold real property or durable goods are different their value is based on attributes such as demand gold oil or location real property if you bought an apartment in manhattan in 1975 it appreciated greatly in value over the course of 30 years but it did so because demand for apartments in new york city grew while the supply of apartments grew more slowly the government prints money for two core reasons think of it this way money is valuable because it is money

please do not conflate number of credit cards with amount of debt consider two scenarios the latter scenario yields much better credit scoring many recommendation sources suggest the following although your credit score seems very important it is only important when you have financial interactions such as applying for credit or services where the other party makes decisions based upon the score you should only obtain loans and credit when you want and it makes sense based upon your needs choosing to live your life to serve credit scoring agencies may not be your happy place

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

do you have other things you might want to spend that cash on in the near future like a down payment on a house beyond having emergency cash the only reason to keep a pile of cash around is because you might need it for another purchase unless you are going to have other expenses that will require higher interest loans to cover them there 's no need to sit on a big pile of cash as long as you are getting the full match on your 401(k that 's the free money that might be worth more than the interest you are paying on the loans in any case i suggest you aim for at least 10 into your 401(k account moving forward in your life so that you can properly fund retirement 15 would be even better it does n't sound like you would be losing anything by paying the student loans and you could then use the money freed from your loan payments to pay down your car faster

the likely reason the mortgage is tricky to get is the adviser is probably recommending an interest only mortgage in which there is no repayment of principle before maturity   that would allow you to deduct the amount of the interest expense from your taxable income   your investment grows compound tax deferred and the principal invested the mortgage balance is completely tax free since it never qualifies as income for tax purposes example ideal scenario refinance $ 100,000 on a arm interest only at 3   invest the $ 100,000 at 6   each year you effectively pay taxes on only the gains greater than interest   if you reinvest the profits it looks something like net profit     $ effective tax rate

let me give you the benefit of my experience i paid a bunch of points 4 when i bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including why i wish i had n't 1 interest rates plummeted not as likely to happen today and i wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that i would have had over the life of the loan also it made me feel stupid for paying close to $ 5 k to knock 1 or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade 2 i did n't take into account that i 'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early and i did way early so even if i had n't refinanced the extra points were really a waste of money 3 in the us at least you ca n't always deduct all of the money you paid in points in the first year you may have to spread that deduction over several years 4 you are right about the alternative being better investing the points since the benefit of paying them is at most 1 2 on your loan you do n't even need a 6 7 return to make it a better deal to invest them however i get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that if you do n't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years or whatever the term of the loan is it 's easy to say that when you are talking but $ 5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done good luck with the new house

house as investment is not a good idea besides the obvious calculations do n't forget the property tax home maintenance costs and time insurance costs etc there are a lot of hidden drains on the investment value of the house most especially the time that you have to invest in maintaining it on the other hand if you plan on staying in the area having children pets or like do home improvements landscaping gardening auto repair wood metal shopping then a house might be useful to you also consider the housing market where you are this gets a bit more difficult to calculate but if you have a high demand rental market then the house might make sense as an investment if you can rent it out for more than your monthly cost including all of those factors above but being a landlord is not for everyone again more of your time invested into the house you have to be prepared to go months without renting it you may have to deal with crazy people that will totally trash your house and threaten you if you complain and you may need to part with some of the rent to a management company if you need their skills or time it sounds like you are just not that interested right now that 's fine do n't rush invest your money some other way i.e. the stock market more than likely when you are ready for a house or to bail your family out of trouble if that 's what you choose to do you 'll have even more assets to do either with

there are people that make up a small segment of the population that have an unsatisfied need to see the of other people 's houses   there 's also a segment of the population that do n't quite understand the big picture of how service professions work for example any group of friends going into a restaurant and requesting a table and sitting at it for over an hour but feel they do n't need to leave a tip because they only ordered or shared a desert   sure you 're paying for the service of a service professional but it should also include their time and resources you consume outside of the actual service but many do n't have that perspective   why should i pay you if you are n't providing your actual service to me even though i 'm consuming your time and resources that would be earning you your expected salary otherwise is their justification   so when you encounter an individual from both small segments of the population mentioned above the result is the problem your wife faces with perspective buyers i look at the agent buyer relationship from a different perspective when i encounter these no harm intended individuals   i do n't see it as the buyer is hiring the agent for if that was the case a contract of some sorts would be involved detailing the menu of services provided by the agent with associated costs the buyer would make selections from the menu pay the costs and services   rendered   but that 's not how it works   so its important to understand the perspective of the agent looking to hire the buyer you 're not paying the buyer to be your client but you are looking to select the prospective buyer that 's going to generate cash flow   in a commissions based work force that is also your main source of income you have to look at prospective clients as that simply prospects but who are a vital component of your salary   so when allocating your time and resources especially if you 're dealing with several prospects you literally have to turn away these cold leads who are just looking for design tips   and paint color pattern suggestions and you as their escort   if i was in the shoe making business i would n't hire a walk in give him access to materials and   work space with the assumption that if its to his liking it 'll generate profit towards my salary needs if the only thing he 's interested in doing is looking around at all the other shoes a behavior that requires my presence time and resources   you almost ca n't even justify it as looking at it as possible income in the future if it 's costing you revenue now whether its in the form of having to neglect actual buyers or you could be investing your time in things that would impact salary needs such as advance course work attending optional trainings offered by your broker or investing time finding more serious leads

lmao so the fact that the government could possibly switch currency negates the current demand they create the government creates a demand for usd that alone is enough to say dollars have intrinsic value    add to that the fact that there are trillions of dollars in outstanding government bonds that are required to be paid out in usd when they mature changing the currency would be considered a form of default by many and could have massive negative consequence far the benefits of the rapid adoption of blockchain even if they stopped issuing bonds today they would still have ones maturing until    it 's like saying bananas do n't have monetary value because people might decide to stop buying them yeah it 's true they would lose value if that happened but as of today it 's just not true

as i write this the nasdaq composite is at down points from yesterday to calculate the percentage you take and divide by yesterday 's close of to yield 0.22 in your example if spy drops from to you use the difference of and divide by the original i.e. = spy is an etf which you can invest in that tracks the s&p 500 index ideally the index would have dropped the same percentage as spy but the points would be different higher to answer your question about how one qualifies a point it completely depends on the index being discussed for example the s&p 500 is a market capitalization weighted index of the common stock of 500 large cap us public companies it is as if you owned every share of each of the 500 companies then divide by some large constant to create a number that 's easily understood mentally i.e. the nasdaq composite used the same methodology but includes practically all stocks listed on the nasdaq meanwhile the dow jones industrial average is a price weighted index of 30 large cap companies it 's final value is modified using a divisor known as the dow divisor which accounts for stock splits and similar events that have occurred since a stock has joined the index thus points when referring to an index do not typically represent dollars rather they serve as a quantitative measure of how the market is doing based on the performance of the index constituents etfs like spy add a layer of abstraction by creating an vehicle that ideally tracks the value of the underlying index directly finally neither price nor index value is related to volume volume is a raw measurement of the total number of shares traded for a given stock or the aggregate for a given exchange hope this helps

h.r. basically publication 15 this is the link to 2015 to determine how much to hold based on filing status exemptions and pay amount what 's described here is a form of estimation or in other words h.r. withholds what would be your actual taxes dividing across the number of paychecks you receive assuming your gross pay and exemptions do not change this usually results in a zero sum for taxes owed you will receive nothing and owe nothing as you can see from the charts the year is basically broken down into equal tax units that reflect how much you would owe if you worked at that bracket all year this estimation works best when you have steady hours from check to check in other words your taxes are based on the estimate of what you 'd make if you earned that much all year scaled down to the time frame e.g. if you are paid weekly or if you paid biweekly they do not go up near the end of the year because they 're estimated in advance you do n't move up a tax bracket but are instead taxed at a particular bracket every paycheck there 's also other forms of estimation mentioned there but basically follow the same scheme note that all estimation forms are just estimates it 's best to use a calculator and compare your current taxes whenever a significant change a raise a new child getting married or divorced etc you 'll want to be able to alter your exemptions so that enough taxes are coming out that 's also the reason for the withhold extra box so that you can avoid owing for example if you 're making $ 44 a week for the first 26 weeks and then you make $ a week for the second 26 weeks of the year you 'll end up with an actual tax liability of $ but end up paying only $ you would owe $ of course the actual math is a lot more complicated if you 're an employee paid by the minute for example or you have a child go to college etc paychecks that vary wildly like $ 10,000 one week and $ 2,000 the next tend to have the hardest to predict estimates e.g. jobs with big commission payouts you should avoid living check to check with jobs that pay this way because you 'll probably end up owing taxes conversely if you 've done your estimates right and you 're paid salary or exactly the same number of hours every week you 'll find that the taxes are much easier to predict and you can usually easily create a refund situation simply by having the correct exemptions on your check so in summation if your check falls in the 25 category which is of course 25 above the tax bracket break point you 're already paying the correct amount and no further drop in your check would be expected

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

yes you can request for additional loan and it would be given as cash you are free to do whatever you like with it this does not mean bank will automatically grant you loan they would ask you purpose check your ability to make additional repayments verify if the property has actually appreciated before deciding note this is not savings this makes sense only if you can generate returns greater than the cost of loan

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

i 'm sorry you are going through this but what you are dealing with is exactly is how cosigning works   it is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100 prepared to pay the loan on their behalf unfortunately the main benefit to cosigning a loan is to the bank they do n't care who makes payments only that someone does it is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in what your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is the biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you can not force your friend to do anything if it is for a car your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling guidance on this sort of thing look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there you can sue your friend in small claims court but keep in mind it also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income while it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court if it 's for $ 500 it probably is n't worthwhile but if your friend just stopped paying off their $ 30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it even though they can pay for it themselves

considering i 'm in a nearly identical situation i 'll speak to my personal strategy and maybe there 's some value for you as well    you have in loans which you say you could pay off today   so what i read is that you 're sitting there with a $ 22k investment and want to know which investment to make pay down debt invest in yourself start up or some variation between those options   any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk and what is my gain paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk and gains you returns of 3.4 6.8 3.4 4.5 and 6.8   those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown investing in a startup is inherently risky with the potential for big payoffs but with this investment you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next apple it could also fail   so with your situation like mine i 'd say it 's best to accept the easy investment for now and fully vet out your tech start up idea in the meantime

the slips from your bank for your hsa account are for an account already established and thus the bank is willing to accept your deposits even if they arrive at the bank after the april 15 deadline as long as the postmark   is april 15 or earlier the account exists in the bank they know who you are and that the payment is received after april 15 is just due to the normal or even abnormal delays in postal delivery for the new account that you tried to establish with appropriate and timely postmark etc the credit union could not   have received the paperwork as of the close of business on april 15 except in the very unlikely circumstance that a local letter deposited in the mailbox in the morning gets delivered the same day by usps do n't extrapolate from stories of how mail was delivered in london in victorian times ergo you did not   have an hsa account in the credit union as of april 15 and they are perfectly correct in refusing to open an account with a april 15 date and put money into it for the previous tax year to answer the question asked   are they allowed to ignore the postmark date yes not only are they allowed to ignore the postmark date the irs insists that they ignore the postmark date the credit union prefers to report only the truth as of april 15 you had not established an hsa account as of april 15 to say otherwise would be making a false statement to the irs

your question is a complex one because knowledge of the investor 's beliefs about the market is required   for almost any quantitative portfolio one must have a good estimate of the expected return vector and covariance matrix of the assets in question   the expected return vector in particular is far from   no one agrees on it and there is no way to know who is right and who is wrong in a world satisfying the conditions of the capm you can bypass this problem because the main implication of the capm is that the market weights are optimal   in that case the answer to your question is that you should determine the market weights of the various assets and use those along with saving in a risk free account or borrowing depending on your risk tolerance   this portfolio has the added benefit that you do n't need to rebalance much the weights in your portfolio adjust at the same rate as the market weights any portfolio that has something besides this also includes some notion of expected return aside from capm fair pricing   the question for you then is whether you have such a notion   if you do you can mix your information with the market weights to come up with a portfolio   this is what the black method does for example get the expected return vector implied by market weights and the covariance matrix mix with your expected return vector then use mean variance optimization to come up with your final weights

short answer absolutely not unless you 're comfortable with putting years of your labor into a depreciating asset that will incur hefty maintenance costs over its remaining life i.e. consider your 10 k gone forever once you buy the car and then some some comments on your reasons keeping up with spoiled brats is a losing proposition and is a mindset counterproductive to financial independence i 'd encourage you to find a way to not care about how the spoiled brats live their lives it wo n't be easier when you 're older and you see your peers driving fancy cars and living fantasy lifestyles that you are tempted to emulate break the impulse to keep up and you 'll be in a much better place a used bmw may not be a piece of junk at first but once you hit 100 k miles everything will suddenly fall apart and need repair been there myself still have the car after 7 years only because very few people want to buy a high mileage german sport sedan with recurring maintenance issues see 2 it will be a good drive for a while then it will own you this is not so bad when you have a decent amount of savings but when you have nothing it 's very hard to truly enjoy the car while knowing that any problems not covered by warranty will be financially devastating are you prepared to ride the bus for 4 weeks while saving enough income from work to replace a bad clutch i had to do this and it 's not something i brag about

without any highly credible anticipation of a company being a target of a pending takeover its common stock will normally trade at what can be considered non control or passive market prices i.e. prices that passive securities investors pay or receive for each share of stock when there is talk or suggestion of a publicly traded company 's being an acquisition target it begins to trade at control market prices i.e. prices that an investor or group of them is expected to pay in order to control the company   in most cases control requires a would be control shareholder to own half a company 's total votes not necessarily stock plus one additional vote and to pay a greater price than passive market prices to non control investors and sometimes to other control investors the difference between these two market prices is termed a control premium   the and value of this premium has been upheld in case law with some conflicting opinions in delaware court see the reference below linkedin corp. is incorporated in the state most other us states courts and those of many countries with active stock markets the amount of premium is largely determined by investment bankers who in addition to applying other valuation approaches review most recently available similar transactions for premiums paid and advise formally in an opinion letter their clients what range of prices to pay or accept in addition to increasing the likelihood of being outbid by a third party failure to pay an adequate premium is often grounds for class action lawsuits that may take years to resolve with great uncertainty for most parties involved for a recent example and more details see this media opinion and overview about dell inc. being taken private in 2013 the lawsuits that transaction prompted and the court 's ruling in 2016 in favor of passive shareholder plaintiffs   though it has more to do with determining fair valuation than specifically premiums the case illustrates instruments and means used by some courts to protect non control passive shareholders = = = = = = = = = = reference as a reference in a 2005 note written by a major us based international corporate law firm it noted with respect to delaware courts which most major shareholder conflicts as the state has a disproportionate share of large companies in its domicile that control premiums may not necessarily be paid to minority shareholders if the acquirer gains control of a company that continues to have minority shareholders i.e. not a full acquisition delaware case law is clear that the value of a dissenting target company 's    stockholder ’s shares is not to be reduced to impose a minority    discount reflecting the lack of the control over the    corporation indeed this appears to be the rationale for valuing the    target corporation as a whole and allocating a proportionate share of    that value to the shares of a dissenting stockholder exercising his appraisal rights in seeking to challenge the value the target company 's board of directors placed on his shares at the same    time delaware courts have suggested without explanation that the    value of the corporation as a whole and as a going concern should    not include a control premium of the type that might be realized in a    sale of the corporation

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

i have a little experience with this   my home state of wisconsin was on this list until 2011 the thing to remember is that these states simply do not recognize the hsa   what this means is that there are no state income tax advantages to the account and no state tax penalties either here are the implications when you invest in a taxable account your broker in many cases keeps track of cost basis for you   however when you invest inside an hsa your hsa custodian will generally not keep track of any of this because it is not normally needed   therefore you need to keep track of any cost basis yourself and when you sell calculate the capital gain or loss on your state return in my opinion the hsa is a good deal even if your state does not recognize it   the tax free savings investing is a great deal even if only on your federal taxes   the state return will be a little more complicated but the savings you get on your federal return are worth it in my situation our family spends the money in the hsa on medical expenses fast enough that we do n't invest it in anything other than an interest bearing savings account   therefore we did n't have to worry about capital gains inside our hsa and only had to add contributions and earnings to our state income   i am very glad that our state now recognizes the hsa

technically the difference between dividends and growth ought to be that dividends can be reinvested in stocks other than the one that paid them which is a definite advantage if you actually have a strategy   dividend stocks used to be preferred for exactly that reason back in the days when fewer people were directly playing in the market and more knew what they were doing unfortunately   getting a periodic dividend from a stock whose price is relatively steady is n't as exciting a game as watching your stock 's value bounce around and hopefully   creep upward on a second by second basis those who are thinking in gambling terms rather than investment terms or who think they can beat the pros at high frequency trading comment withheld want the latter and have been putting a lot of pressure on companies to operate in the latter mode that does n't make it better certainly not for the longer term investors just more fashionable and fashion often means getting stuck with something impractical because everyone else is doing it on this i second scrooge

free huh from their commission and fee schedule   so if you literally bought two shares then the sec added one penny in fees and finra added one penny as a trading activity fee note that there are several other fees on their schedule that may not apply to you if you had bought 100 shares instead your total fees would have still been only 2 cents but you would have lost $ 4 on the trade   so the fees are minuscule when you start doing larger orders    however that should not discourage you from experimenting and learning   i 'd rather pay 2 cents in fees on a 4 cent loss than 2 cents in fees on a $ 400 loss   just chalk it up to the cost of experience

the price of the last trade is the price of the last trade it indicates what one particular buyer and seller agreed upon there is absolutely no requirement that one of them did n't offer too much or demand too little so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand an average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price wait for that price and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that which may not be the best in the next or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable trading these risks off against each other pick the one which comes closest to your intent and ignore the fact that others may be getting a slightly different price that 's just the way the market works if his price is lower why did n't you buy it there he 's out of stock well come back when i 'm out of stock and i 'll be unable to sell it to you for an even better price

here is one other consideration do n't do n't do n't sell based on insider information insider trading can land you in jail and it 's not restricted to top executives even a discussion about the current status of the acquisition talks can mean that you have insider information that you legally can not act on in many jurisdictions if you are just a regular employee the sec will likely not subject your dealings to special scrutiny especially since lots of your colleagues will likely trade your company 's shares at this point in time and if you definitely hold insider info for example if you are intimately involved with the acquisition talks you will likely have had a very serious warning about insider trading and know what you can and what you can not do nevertheless it 's better to be careful here

i think you need a lesson on banking 101    gt i mean siphoning funds assuming that you 're going to be running a hft shop or prop trading or using models to predict when something is most profitable which is beneficial to your wallet but not really to society   i am confused maybe your logic will clarify this concept for me say i have invested in a mutual fund which has done really well and i have made returns of over 120 in is this considered stealing as well according to you it would be maybe others were more patriotic and invested their savings in treasury bonds which probably earned them say 28 in the past 12 years how is this different from someone working as prop shop trader you should generalize it as a trader not just quants sometimes they take losses other times they make profits most just manage to make a living if not they find another career which i think a cynical man like you ought to be doing too if you truly understand the industry structure and believe in it you will realize it 's just another profession if you 're truly disgusted by this profession maybe ask yourself why does society tolerate over priced attorneys over priced doctors high end real estate expensive designer clothing stores many other examples to cite here to bring things closer to your life in perspective the $ 10 t shirt you 're wearing was probably prepared by   people like my cousins in india who work for wages of $ 110 a month should i call you a thief for stealing from her

do n't do debt   after a few years i forget how many the bad history will have rolled off but by then you will probably have no desire to go back into debt again if you do want to build up a credit score then at that point it 's essentially the same as starting from scratch   however from personal experience once you 've lived debt free for a few years you never want to get back on the debt wheel again a credit score is the output of a behavioral model that indicates the chances that a bank will earn money from your business do things that earn the banks money and you will have a high credit score

banks want to be paid back and if you do n't then want to be able to sell your property for enough money to cover what you did n't pay back your credit rating will determine the interest rate you pay and this affects how much you can borrow because a higher interest rate means that you can borrow less on the same terms than you could with a lower interest rate paying 50 down will bring your payment way down of course and will improve everything about your loan debt to income ratio debt to equity but you 'll likely still be charged the higher interest rate based on your credit rating this of course is contingent on the property 's value properly

insurance is n't a product designed to protect against financial loss the product is designed to allow people to pay a small fee the premium for peace of mind this allows the insured to feel as if their purchase was worthy they see the potential of loss as a concern and the premiums small enough to allow them to not worry about having a loss insurance companies will then seek out risks where the perceived losses far out weight the actual losses risk assessment so you answer is that your friends are paying for peace of mind

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

i have maintained that traditional tv will be obsolete for years now it seems a certain inevitability since the invention of the internet    even assuming it is certain there are some things to consider   1 time frame it is taking way longer than i had expected for people to switch away from traditional subscriptions packaging   many people refuse to adopt adapt to new technology and like the comfortable familiarity of tv it is hard to say exactly when the big shift will happen   2 the companies making billions of dollars are likely monitoring their revenues market very closely and will probably know better than you when their current business model is about to fail they may develop a plan to switch to internet based distribution production of shows or any number of other alternatives which might not cause their share price to drop as drastically as one might predict   profiting from this idea as with any strategy relies on you to identify the stocks that will be affected and time your short position on them better than the rest of the market doing it now or at an arbitrary date means you will incur the opportunity cost of holding the instrument over a period when another investment would yield better returns potentially even a long position on these same companies

a loan is most generally a liability a part of the balance sheet   expenses income are part of the income statement   income is the net of revenues after expenses the interest is an expense on the income statement but the loan itself does not reside there unless if it is defaulted and forgiven   then it would become a revenue or contra expense depending on the methodology the original purpose of the income statement is to show the net inflows of short term operational accruals which would exclude new borrowing and repaid loans the cash flow statement will better show each cash event such as borrowing debt repaying debt or paying off a bill to show how a loan may have funded a bill which in theory it directly did not because an entity be it a person or business is like a single tank of water with multiple pipes filling and multiple pipes extracting so it is impossible to know which exact inflow funded which exact outflow unless if there is only one inflow per period and one outflow per the same period that being said with a cash flow statement the new loan will show a cash inflow when booked under the financing portion and paying a bill will show a cash outflow when booked under the operating portion   with only those two transactions booked and an empty balance sheet beforehand it could be determined that a new loan funded a bill payment

first of all it 's quite common place in gnucash and in accounting in general i believe to have accounts that represent concepts or ideas rather than actual accounts at some institution   for example my personal gnucash book has a plethora of expense accounts just made up by me to categorize my spending but all of the transactions are really just entries in my checking account as to your actual question i 'd probably do this by tracking such savings as negative expenses using an expense account and entering negative numbers   you could track grocery savings in your grocery expense account or if you want to easily analyze the savings data for example seeing savings over a certain time period you would probably want a separate grocery savings expense account edit regarding putting that money aside here 's an idea   let 's say you bought a $ 20 item that was on sale for $ 15   you could have a single transaction in gnucash that includes four splits one for each of the following actions decrease your checking account by $ 20 increase your expense account by $ 20 decrease your discount savings expense account by $ 5 and increase your savings account where you 're putting that money aside by $ 5

one way to analyze the opportunity cost of using a 401 k loan would be to calculate your net worth after using a 401 k loan   if your net worth increases then the 401 k loan would be advisable   note that the calculations provided below do not take into account tax considerations a net worth calculation is where you add all your assets and then subtract all your liabilities   the resulting number is your net worth first calculate the net worth of not taking the loan and simply paying the credit card interest   this means you only pay the interest on the credit card   in addition to the parameters identified in your question two additional parameters will need to be considered cash and the market rate of return on the 401k. scenario 1 only pay credit card interest after 12 months all you have paid is the interest on the credit card   the 401 k balance is untouched so it will hopefully grow   the balance on the credit card remains at the end of 12 months scenario 2 use 401 k loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from your 401 k to pay the credit card balance   you will have to pay $ 5,000 plus the 401 k interest rate back into your 401 k account use the following equation to determine when scenario 2 increases your net worth more than scenario 1 thus if your credit card interest rate is greater than the rate you can earn on your 401 k then use the 401 k loan to pay off the credit card balance another scenario that should be considered borrow money from somewhere else to pay off the credit card balance scenario 3 external loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from somewhere besides your 401 k to pay off the credit card balance the following is used to determine if you should use an external loan over the 401 k loan this means you should use an external loan if you can obtain an interest rate less than the rate of return you can earn on your 401k.   the same methodology can be used to compare scenario 3 to scenario 1

the reason it 's broken out is very specific this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month   it is the only place that 's shown typically each month 's minimum payment is the sum of the interest accrued during that month and some principal say m = and b is your total loan balance   that i is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month you always must pay off the accrued interest   it changes each month as some of the principal is reduced if you have a 3 daily interest rate you owe approximately plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues each month or 30 or 28   since b is going down constantly as principal is paid off i is also going down the p is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time   that 's why p changes each month because it 's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment m than to have a fixed p and variable i for a variable m. as such it 's important to show you the i amount both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged paid and for your tax purposes

if your employer is matching 50 cents on the dollar then your 401(k is a better place to put your money than paying off credit cards this   assuming you can also get the credit cards paid off reasonably soon too say by next year   otherwise you have to look at how long before you can withdraw that money to see if the compounded credit card debt is n't growing faster than your retirement   but a guaranteed 50 gain your first year is a pretty hard deal to beat and if you currently have no savings unless all of your surplus income has been reducing your debt you 're living beyond your means you should be earning more than you 're going to be spending when you start paying rent car bills   if you do n't know what this is going to be you need to be budgeting    get this under control by any means necessary   new job career   change priorities expectations   cut expenses   live to your budget   whatever it takes i do n't think you should be in any investment that includes bonds until you 're 40 and maybe not even then equities and cash equivalents all the way cash is for emergency funds and for waiting for buying opportunities   otherwise michael has some good ideas i would caveat that i think you should not buy any investments in one chunk but dollar average it over some period of time in case the market is high right when you decide to invest you should also gauge possible returns and potential tax liabilities debt is good to get rid of unless it is good debt very low interest rates ie lower than you could borrow the money for   good debt should still get paid off who knows how long your job could last for but maybe not dump all of your $ 50 k on it roth is amazing   you should be maxing that contribution out every year

there are mechanisms for determining how valuable a property is without resorting to artificial government valuations that can rise drop in relation to the local economy   the most interesting i 'm aware of is to force a sale of a property for x times the tax the person is paying   so for instance if i value my home business property at 100 k and the forced sale factor is 100x then i would pay at least 1k year for taxes maybe a bit more just to be safe   this also solves the imminent domain issue   that is a bit science though   in reality using an average of similar recent sales while imperfect is good enough    is important in all kinds of investments   i agree but governments can always raise rates or cut services or borrow in hard times in general the property values should track fairly closely other forms of economic activity

will pull your credit report and perform a hard inquiry on your file this means the inquiry will be noted in your credit report and count against you slightly this is perfectly normal just do n't apply too many times too soon or it can begin to add up they will want proof of your income by asking for recent pay stubs with this information your income and your credit profile they will determine the maximum amount of credit they will lend you and at what interest rate the better your credit profile the more money they can lend and the lower the rate   you want financed the price of the car minus your down payment that is the amount you can apply for and in that case the only factors they will determine are 1 whether or not you will be approved and 2 at what interest rate you will be approved while interest rates generally follow the direction of the prime rate as dictated by the federal reserve there are market fluctuations and variances from one lending institution to the next further different institutions will have different criteria in terms of the amount of credit they deem you worthy of   know the price of the car now determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union or work directly with the dealer dealers often give special deals if you finance through them a common scenario is 1 a person goes to the car dealer 2 test drives 3 negotiates the purchase price 4 the salesman works the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank pay attention during that last process this is also where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate by offering longer loan terms to maximize their returns on your loan it 's not necessarily a bad thing it 's just how they have to make their money in the deal it 's good to know so you can form your own analysis of the deal and make sure they do n't completely bankrupt you   that you can comfortable afford your monthly payment the car dealers do n't really know how much you can afford they will try to determine to the best they can but only you really know do n't take more than you can afford be conservative about it for example think you can only afford $ 300 a month budget it even lower and make yourself only afford $ 225 a month

the rebate amount is a non qualified distribution irs pub 969 describes how the hsa works reporting distributions on your return how you report your distributions depends on whether or not you use the distribution for qualified medical expenses defined earlier if you use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you do not pay tax on the distribution but you have to report the distribution on form 8889 however the distribution of an excess contribution taken out after the due date including extensions of your return is subject to tax even if used for qualified medical expenses follow the instructions for the form and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you do not use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you must pay tax on the distribution report the amount on form 8889 and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you have a taxable hsa distribution include it in the total on form 1040 or form 1040nr line 21 and enter hsa and the amount on the dotted line next to line 21 you may have to pay an additional 20 tax on your taxable distribution i looked at several plans regarding how to handle mistaken distributions example a what if i accidentally use my hsa visa debit card for a non qualified expense    to fix this problem just bring that same amount into any local branch and tell us it was a mistaken distribution we can then put the funds back into your hsa and correct the problem   example b   you ’re allowed to correct mistaken    hsa withdrawals when there is clear and convincing    evidence that amounts were distributed from an hsa    because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause you    can correct the mistake by repaying the withdrawal    no later than april 15 following the first year that you    knew or should have known that the withdrawal was    a mistake when a correction is made the mistaken    withdrawal does not have to be included in gross    income or be subject to the 6 percent additional tax and    the repayment does not count as an excess contribution    if an error is made by in its role as the    administrator will be responsible for    taking appropriate action check with your plan trustee on their procedure to fix the mistaken withdrawal

yes it is under some circumstances basically a piece of paper saying john doe borrowed josh shoe 100 usd is not enough usually the paper should include this is the case for czech republic i believe it 's similar for other countries as well remember that without the repair date you have very complicated position forcing the person to give you the money back as well there 's a withdrawal of rights i.e. after x years after the repair date you can not force the person to give you the money you have to send the case to the court in some period after the repair date if you do n't have the money yet

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

when the vc is asking what your pre money valuation is he 's asking what percentage of shares his $ 200,000 will buy if you say your company is worth $ 800 k then after he puts the money in it will be worth $ 1 m and he will own 20 of all shares you 'll still own the remainder so when the vc is asking for a valuation what he really wants to know is how much of your company he 's going to own after he funds you   determining your pre money valuation then is a question of negotiation how much money will you need how likely are you to require more money later and thus dilute the vc 's shares or give up more of your own shares how likely is your business to survive and how much money will it make if it does survive it is n't about the actual value of your business right now as much as it is how much work has gone into this and how successful can it be the value is going to be a bit higher than you expect because the work is already done and you can get to market faster than someone else who has n't started yet vcs are often looking for long shots they 'll invest in 10 companies and expect 7 to fail 2 to be barely profitable and the last one to make hilarious amounts of money a vc does n't necessarily want 51 of your company you 'll probably lose motivation if you 're not in charge but they 'll want as much as they can get otherwise

the simplest explanation is that a traditional ira is a method of deferring taxes that is normally you pay taxes on money you earn at the ordinary rate then invest the rest and only pay the capital gains rate   however with a traditional ira you do n't pay taxes on the money when you earn it you defer the payment of those taxes until you retire so in the end it ends up being treated the same that said if you are strategic about it you can wind up paying less taxes with this type of account

there are two things i can think of that might be different in other countries until 2013 american express visa and mastercard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases and merchants ca n't pass that onto credit card users they just make everyone pay extra instead since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via rewards points almost all credit cards here have grace periods where you wo n't be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days this makes credit cards attractive to people who do n't need a loan but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash extra insurance better fraud protection apparently grace periods are n't required by law here so this might be common in other countries as well

dividends are paid based on who owns the security on a designated day   if a particular security pays once per year you hold days and sell on the day before the critical day you get no dividend   this is not special to 401(k or to drip   it 's just how the system works the critical day is the day before the posted ex dividend date for the security if you own at the end of that day you get the dividend   if you sell on that day or before you do not your company changing providers is not in itself relevant   the important factor is whether you can still hold your same investments in the new plan   if not you will not get the dividend on anything that you currently hold but sell due to the change in providers   if you can then you potentially get the dividend so long as there 's no glitch in the transition incidentally it works the other way too   you might end up getting a dividend through the new plan for something that you did not hold the full year

most of the consumer products that you buy at retail these days are commodity priced and have been for a long time margins are thin so if there are retail salespeople about their compensation is n't coming from the tv or computer with a 6 gross margin it comes from the extended warranty programs which are not insurance and do not have regulated underwriting standards which are typically sold at a 65 95 gross margin so that $ 200 warranty most likely costs the retailer $ 50 the salesman gets $ 15 25 i paid for my college education working at a selling these things along with other high margin items that paid commission in most cases you are n't getting much coverage anyway most products carry a 1 year warranty and using most gold or platinum credit cards doubles a manufacturer 's warranty by up to 1 year so with most transactions you are already walking away with a 2 year warranty   warranties or service plans make sense for durable goods that cost alot and are expected to last a long time and/or require regular maintenance i think they especially make sense if your budget is really tight a fixed maintenance cost can be an asset to some people because they can plan around it examples of this include service plans for a furnace boiler or water heater or a car if you 're buying a manufacturer endorsed service maintenance plan from a dealer

yes from the point of view to the end speculator investor in stocks it is ludicrous to take on liabilities when you do n't have to   that 's why single stock options are far more liquid than single stock futures however if you are a farmer with a huge mortgage depending upon the chaos of agricultural markets which are extremely volatile a different structure might appeal to you   you could long your inputs while shorting your outputs locking in a profit   that profit is probably lower than what one could expect over the long run without hedging but it will surely be less volatile here 's where the advantage of futures come in for that kind of structure the margin on the longs and shorts can offset each other forcing the farmer to have to put up much less of one 's own money to hedge   with options this is not the case also the gross margin between the inputs rarely fluctuate to an degree so if your shorts rise faster than your longs you 'll only have to post margin in the amount of the change in the net of the longs and shorts this is why while options on commodities exist to satisfy speculators futures are the most liquid

from paul and mike of the 101 years of global investment returns princeton princeton university press 2002 the small firm effect has not proved the road to    great riches since soon after its discovery the us size premium went    into reverse this was repeated in the united kingdom and virtually    all other markets around the world despite their disappointing performance in recent years the very    long run record of small caps remains one of outperformance in both    the united states and the united kingdom furthermore and    small size companies are still an important asset class their    differential performance over long periods of history shows that there    is useful scope for investors to reduce risk by diversifying across    the large and the small capitalization sectors of the market    furthermore given the of the size effect across the    entire size spectrum it is important to all investors since the    size tilt of any portfolio will strongly influence its short- and    long run performance this holds true whether there is a size premium    or a size discount the size effect has certainly proved persistent    and robust what is at issue is whether we should continue to expect a    size premium over the longer haul and accompanying charts     and one chart from blackrock

in a money market fund one share is worth $ 1 for your fund you 'll earn $ a year per share or 0.10   that is all that you will earn the apy is just another number to represent this interest rate not a separate income stream if you were expecting extra money from a separately credited dividend you were mistaken usually the apy is a slightly different number than the interest rate to reflect the way that the interest is compounded over the course of the year in this case the compounding is too slight to notice with just 2 decimal places if you were investing in a regular savings account you would see the rate you are paid expressed as an apy also but not as a dividend as no shares are involved and use that number to compare the two if you were buying a bond fund or stock fund that did not have a fixed price you could calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price but you would not probably see an apy listed money market funds are kind of an odd hybrid of fund and savings so they list both

first of all congratulations on paying off $ 40k in debt in one year mathematically you 'd be better off making the standard car loan payments and putting your extra money toward the student loan however there are a few other things that you might want to consider over the last year you 've knocked out a whole bunch of different debts   feels pretty good does n't it   at your current rate you could knock out your new car loan in 6 months   then you 'd only have one debt left   if it sounds to you like it would be nice to only have one debt left then it might be worth the mathematical disadvantage you would get by paying off the car early instead of putting the money toward the last student loan the car loan is 0 but if you are late on a single payment they will take that opportunity to raise your interest rate to something probably higher than the interest rate of your student loan   for this reason you may decide it is not worth the hassle and you 'd rather just eliminate the car loan as quickly as possible either choice is fine in my opinion as long as you have a purpose behind the choice and you are committed to eliminating both debts as quickly as possible as an aside it is important to remember that even a 0 loan is not really free money and needs to be paid back   you know this of course but sometimes you see a 0 loan and it feels like free money   it 's not   you have probably already paid for the loan by forfeiting a rebate   so although at this point having already taken this loan and paying for it you will come out ahead by dragging out your car loan for the full term in the future do not think that you can make money by buying something at 0 interest

this answer assumes based partly on your and some simplifying assumptions as i see it you have a few options get a mortgage to buy your sister out this avoids any ongoing involvement of your sister which may or may not be a good thing it means you will be paying interest to a bank or similar financial institution make an arrangement to buy the house in installments in combination with some kind of rent likely to be a complex option to set up buy the house using a loan from your sister potentially agree a private mortgage to protect your sister in the event you fail to pay if interest is paid then it is likely to attract tax simply pay your sister rent let her keep ownership of her half of the house either forever or until you have saved up the cash to buy her out rent is likely to attract tax whatever option you go with i would you get advice on any local legal tax issues and drawing up the contracts if you do go into an arrangement that keeps your sister involved make sure you discuss the what ifs upfront and build them into your agreement if you can't won't pay what happens can she insist that the house is sold and the proceeds split in some way can she rent our her half of the house to someone else

if you download the historical data from yahoo you will see two different close prices the one labeled close is simply the price that was quoted on that particular day the one labeled adj close is the close price that has been adjusted for any splits and dividends that have occurred after that date   for example if a stock splits 10:1 on a particular date then the adjusted close for all dates prior to that split will have been divided by 10 if a dividend is paid then all dates prior will have that amount subtracted from their adjusted quote using the adjusted close allows you to compare any two dates and see the true relative return

sorry i always use my phone when using reddit and i 'm also not a native speaker basically what i tried to say is   the reason the whole world using this economic system is because when people divide their work force and everyone specializes on one thing they are much better at it gain more experience become more efficient and basically it is just more productive    that s why everyone has a job   but jobs has few downsides most prominent one being making all these repetitive tasks one can lose their purpose this is the situation for the poor community people who do not earn a lot of money and does n't have a good statue can be depressed by going to same place everyday doing the same thing for 40 50 years   for reason is everyone is doing repetitive tasks even if it is something you love personally i would hate my hobbies if i had to do them everyday not for enjoyment but for money but some are being rewarded much more    my goal of telling all these is this is not a perfect economic system but it is the most efficient one today people need motivation if they are going to do the same thing all the time the motivation could be different than money and statue but it is much easier to convince the masses these are important so the machine could work   only a fool with no regard to history would tell this is the best economic system and it will never change since world is always changing 5 years ago companies were banks and investment companies now they are tech internet my belief is that for now the system is structured and will stay the same until which changes the economy war economy needs other stuff compared to what we are producing normally motivation also changes in these times it 's not money anymore but for your countries sake and pride political system which is unusual to most since it is the economic change in classes which makes the political system to change

in us public stock markets there is no difference between the actions individual retail traders are permitted to take and the actions institutional corporate traders are permitted to take   the only difference is the cost of those actions   for example if you become a registered market maker on say the bats stock exchange you 'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices however in order to qualify for registered market maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes   an individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that but it 's probably too expensive algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading algorithmic trading can be non automated and automated trading can be non algorithmic and both can be anywhere from low- to high frequency   a low frequency automated strategy is essentially indistinguishable from a person clicking their mouse several times per day so no from a legal or regulatory perspective there is no special procedure an individual retail trader has to follow before s he can automate a trading strategy   your broker on the other hand may have all sorts of hoops for you to jump through in order to use their automation platform last but certainly not least you will almost certainly lose money hand over fist attempting bid ask scalping as an individual retail trader whether your approach is algorithmic or not automated or not   why   because the only way to succeed at bid ask scalping is to a always be at near the front of the queue when a price change occurs in your favor and b always cancel your resting orders before they are executed when a price change occurs against you   unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry an individual retail trader operating through a broker 's trading platform can not react quickly enough to succeed at either of those   you would have to eschew the broker and buy direct market access to even have a chance and that 's the point at which you 're no longer a retail trader good luck

technically you should take the quarterly dividend yield as a fraction add one take the cube root and subtract one and then multiple by the stock price if you want a dollar amount per share rather than a rate   this is to account for the fact that you could have re invested the monthly dividends and earned dividends on that reinvestment however the difference between this and just dividing by three is going to be negligible over the range of dividend rates that are realistically paid out by ordinary stocks

gt it was interesting to read the data regarding student loans and the type of impact it has had to borrowers the fed did not necessarily signal the economy is in trouble but a great deal of households do n't have adequate savings to sustain against a moderate financial shock   one of the impacts of the student loans or one they did n't seem to mention is that there are fewer households being formed than there normally would be given the population demographics young people are not only staying in school longer and piling up more student debt just from that in addition to the higher tuition aspect but when they get out fewer of them are establishing their own homes with all that that entails in terms of spending and/or they are spending a lot less on those things than past cohorts have and of course higher rental amp utility and other costs along with flat wages salaries have n't helped that part of the equation either

two different questions is it better to be in debt or to pay off the debt and is it better to have student debt than other debt   any debt needs to be paid off eventually and any debt makes you less flexible so if you have the choice between spending wasting your money and paying off debt i would recommend paying off the debt   the other question is whether having student debt is better than having other debt you need to look at the terms of your student debt pay off the debt with the worst conditions first loan sharks in britain pay day loans must be paid first credit cards debt must go next then general loans depending on your situation you may want some savings as well in case you lose your job for example so if you have $ 8,000 saved and an $ 8,000 student loan you might consider waiting a bit before you pay back the loan no job + $ 8,000 student loan + $ 8,000 in the bank is better than no job + no debt + no money in the bank

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

this is a great question   i 've participated in a deal like that as an employee and i also know of friends and family who have been involved during a buyout   in short   the updated part of your question is correct there is no single typical treatment   what happens to unvested restricted stock units rsus unvested employee stock options etc varies from case to case furthermore what exactly will happen in your case ought to have been described in the grant documentation which you hopefully received when you were issued restricted stock in the first place anyway here are the two cases i 've seen happen before immediate vesting of all units   immediate vesting is often the case with rsus or options that are granted to executives or key employees   the grant documentation usually details the cases that will have immediate vesting   one of the cases is usually a change in of control or provision triggered in a buyout   other immediate vesting cases may be when the key employee is terminated without cause or dies   the terms vary and are often negotiated by shrewd key employees conversion of the units to a new schedule   if anything is more typical of regular employee level grants i think this one would be   generally such rsu or option grants will be converted at the deal price to a new schedule with identical dates and vesting percentages but a new number of units and dollar amount or strike price usually so the end result would have been the same as before the deal i 'm also curious if anybody else has been through a buyout or knows anybody who has been through a buyout and how they were treated

there are very strict regulations that requires the assets which a fund buys on behalf of its investors to be kept completely separate from the fund 's own assets which it uses to pay its expenses except for the published fees funds are typically audited regularly to ensure this is the case so the only way in which a default of the fund could cause a loss of money would be if the fund managers broke the regulations and committed various crimes i 've never heard of this actually happening to a normal mutual fund there is of course also a default risk when a fund buys bonds or other non equity securities and this may sometimes be non obvious for example some etfs which are nominally based on a stock index do n't actually buy stocks instead they buy or sell options on those stocks which involves a counterparty risk the etf may or may not have rules that limit the exposure to any one counterparty

a major thing to consider when deciding whether to invest or pay off debt is cash flow specifically how each choice affects your cash flow and how your cash flow is affected by various events simply enough your cash flow is the amount of money that passes through your finances during a given period often a month or a year some of this is necessary payments like staying current on loans rent etc while other parts are not necessary such as eating out for example you currently have $ 5,500 debt at 3 and another $ 2,500 at 5 this means that every month your cashflow effect of these loans is $ 5,500 3 12 + $ 2,500 5 12 = $ 24 interest before any applicable tax effects plus any required payments toward the principal which you do n't state to have the $ 8,000 paid off in 30 years you 'd be paying another $ 33 toward the principal for a total of about $ 60 per month before tax effects in your case if you take the full $ 7,000 you have available and use it to pay off the debt starting with the higher interest loan then your situation changes such that you now assuming that the repayment timeline remains the same the cashflow effect of the above becomes $ 1,000 3 12 = $ interest plus $ toward the principal again before tax effects in one fell swoop you just reduced your monthly payment from $ 60 to $ 5.25 per year this means $ 720 to $ 63 so on the $ 7,000 invested in repayment you get $ in return every year for a annual return on investment it will take you about 11 years to use only this money to save another $ 7,000 as opposed to the 30 years original repayment schedule if the extra payment goes toward knocking time off the existing repayment schedule but keeping the amount paid toward the principal per month the same you are now paying $ 33 toward the principal plus $ 2.50 interest against the $ 1,000 loan which means by paying $ you will be debt free in 30 months two and a half years instead of 30 years an effective 92 reduction in repayment time you immediately have another about $ in your budget and in two and a half years you will have $ 60 per month that you would n't have if you stuck with the original repayment schedule if instead the total amount paid remains the same you are then paying about $ toward the principal and will be debt free in less than a year and a half not too shabby if you ask me also do n't forget that this is a known guaranteed return in that you know what you would be paying in interest if you did n't do this and you know what you will be paying in interest if you do this even if the interest rate is variable you can calculate this to a reasonable degree of certainty the difference between those two is your return on investment compare this to the fact that while an investment in the s&p might have similar returns over long periods of time the stock market is much more volatile in the shorter term as the past two decades have so demonstrated it does n't do you much good if an investment returns 10 per year over 30 years if when you need the money it 's down 30 because you bought at a local peak and have held the investment for only a year also consider if you go back to school are you going to feel better about a $ payment or a $ payment even if the payments on old debt are deferred while you are studying you will still have to pay the money and it will likely be accruing interest in the meantime now i really do n't advocate your savings account entirely the way i did in the example above stuff happens all the time and some stuff that happens costs money instead you should be keeping some of that money easily available in a liquid non volatile form which basically means a savings account without withdrawal penalties or a money market fund not the stock market how much depends on your necessary expenses a buffer of three months worth of expenses is an often recommended starting point for an emergency fund the above should however help you evaluate how much to keep how much to invest and how much to use to pay off loans early respectively

my preferred method of doing this is to get a bank draft from the us in euros and then pay it into the french bank my countries are canada and uk but the principle is the same the cost of the bank draft is about $ 8 so very little more than the atm method if you use bigger amounts it can be less overall cost the disadvantage is that a bank draft takes a week or so to write and a few days to clear so you would have to plan ahead i would keep enough money in the french account for one visit and top it up with a new bank draft every visit or two

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

gt not all bachelor 's are the same   of course a degree in gender studies is worthless while a degree in computer science worth more but with so many computer science degrees even that degree does not give you much headway without experience   it 's very simple what happens today compared to the past   today the idea is to keep kids in schools for as long as possible because are worthless and you need masters charge them tons of money pass them so they continue to pay get them into debt and then pay them less because so many people have the degrees even require ba degree for jobs that do n't need it   in the past if you finished high school it was an accomplishment if you got accepted to college it was an accomplishment if you survived the first year in college or got your bachelor degree it was a major accomplishment   if you did not know those accomplishments in the past gave you substantial benefits compared to others   it was much cheaper in the past and much better education they did not care about money and will kick you out of college for any fail   so in the past to be a teller in the bank you did not need to finish high school but just be good with basic algebra   today you need a ba degree and get a lousy salary to be teller in a bank do you understand what happened here   also in the past a person with lower socioeconomic background if they finish high school or got a ba it would for sure really change their lives and they become middle or high class   today a person with poor socioeconomic background even if they got their worthless ba degree they are worst off because they do not have any competitive advantage over other people as all of them have degrees too you are worst off because you are in debt to get the degree and the education you got is bad

not to my knowledge often the specific location is diversified out of the fund because each major building company or real estate company attempts to diversify   risk by spreading it over multiple geographical locations also buyers of these smaller portfolios will again diversify by creating a larger fund to sell to the general public that being said you can sometimes drill down to the specific assets held by a real estate fund that takes a lot of work you can also look for the issuer of the bond that the construction or real estate company issued to find out if it is region specific hope that helps

i 'm fairly convinced there is no difference whatsoever between dividend payment and capital appreciation   it only makes financial sense for the stock price to be decreased by the dividend payment so over the course of any specified time interval without the dividend the stock price would have been that much higher were the dividends not paid   total return is equal i think this is like so many things in finance that seem different but actually are n't if a stock does not pay a dividend you can synthetically create a dividend by periodically selling shares    doing this would incur periodic trade commissions however   that does seem like a loss to the investor   for this reason i do see some real benefit to a dividend   i 'd rather get a check in the mail than i would have to pay a trade commission which would offset a percentage of the dividend does anybody know if there are other hidden fees associated with dividend payments that might offset the trade commissions   one thought i had was fees to the company to establish and maintain a dividend payment program   are there significant administrative fees banking fees etc to the company that materially decrease its value   even if this were the case i do n't know how i 'd detect or measure it because there 's such a loose association between many corporate financials e.g. cash on hand and stock price

your question contains two different concepts fractional reserve banking and debt based money   when thinking of these two things i think it is important to analyze these items separately before trying to understand how the whole system works fractional reserve banking as others have pointed out fractional reserve banking is not a ponzi scheme   it can be fraudulent however   if a bank tells all its depositors that they can withdrawal their money at any time i.e. on demand and the bank then proceeds to loan out some portion of the depositors money then the bank has committed fraud since there is no way they could honor the depositors requests for their money if many of them came for their money at one time   this is true regardless of what type of money is deposited dollars gold etc   this is how most modern banks operate debt based money historically the fed would introduce new money by buying us treasuries   this means federal reserve notes are backed by us treasuries   i agree that this seems strange   does this mean if i take my frns to the fed i could redeem them for us treasuries   but us treasuries are promises to pay frns in the future   this makes my head hurt   reminds me of the definition for see here is an experiment   what if we wanted to recreate frns today and none existed   the us government would offer a note to pay 100 frns in one year and pay 5 interest on the note   the fed would print up its first 100 frns to buy the note from the us government   the us government would spend the frns   the first 100 frns have now entered into circulation   at the end of the note 's term the fed should have 105 frns since the government agreed to pay 5 interest on the note   but how is the us government going to pay the interest and principal on the note when only 100 frns exist   i think this is the central point to your question    i can come up with only two answers 1 the fed must purchase some assets that are not debt based 2 the us government must continue to issue debt that is purchased by newly printed frns in order to pay back older debt and interest   this is a ponzi scheme the record debt levels seem to indicate the ponzi scheme option was chosen

one of your credit reports said this was negatively impacting your credit you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report once per year from each of the three major credit reporting companies in the u.s. equifax and one other it is a good idea to check on these anyway if you have credit accounts   get copies from the other two credit reporting companies see if they also say that your credit is negatively impacted by so many loans even though the balances are small if all three credit reporting companies are in consensus about negative effecting your credit then it is true if that is the case check with your subsidized loan lender about consolidation if the unsubsidized loans are from the same lender ask them too if they 're from different lenders you might want to ask at your bank about getting a debt consolidation loan you might be able to save money by refinancing consolidating the unsubsidized student loans as one loan maybe even all the loans as one loan particularly if you bank at a credit union

the people who cause this sort of sell off immediately are mostly speculators short term day traders and the like they realize that because of the lowered potential for earnings in the future the companies in question wo n't be worth as much in the future they will sell shares at the elevated price including sometimes shares that they borrow for the explicit purpose of selling short selling until the share price is more reasonable now the other question is why the companies in question wo n't sell for as much in the future even if every other company in the world looks less attractive all at once global economic catastrophe etc people have other options they could just put the money in the bank or in corporate bonds or in mortgage bonds or treasury bonds or some other low risk instrument or something crazy like gold if the expected return on a stock does n't justify the price you 're unlikely to find someone paying that price so you do n't actually need to have a huge sell off to lower the price you just need a sell off that 's big enough that you run out of people willing to pay elevated prices

they may stock items that frame the various price points of course they risk having the items go stale before they are sold you also have situations where the store will advertise an item but end up taking a loss on that sale because it will bring people in and they will make other purchases determining what to stock how to display it and how to advertise it involves both math and psychology

you can use long term options called leaps to increase dividend yield here 's how it works let 's say you buy a dividend yielding stock for $ 38 that pays an annual dividend of $ 2 for a 5.3 yield next you sell a deep in the money leaps options in this hypothetical we 'll sell the $ 25 call option for $ 13 that now reduces our cost basis from $ 38 to $ 25 since the dividend remains $ 2 our yield is now $ = 8 now there are issues that may need to be dealt with like early assignment of the option where rolling the option may be necessary   more details of this strategy can be found on my website

as far as i can tell it works like this note i am assuming you were 18 on jan 1 2009 contribution limits so by the end of 2012 you will have been allowed to contribute $ 20,000 of new money you say you 've contributed $ 10,000 so you still can contribute another $ 10,000 of new money this year but let 's assume you do not now your original $ 10,000 has grown to $ 25,000   you can withdraw this without penalty   next year you will be given an allotment of another $ 5000 of new money bringing your total lifetime limit to $ 25,000 $ 10,000 = $ 15,000 new money plus you will be allowed to re contribute up to $ 25,000 of old money of course the government does n't make a distinction between old and new money so the net effect is assuming a 25k withdrawal 2012 limit $ 10 000 2013 limit $ 40 000 less 2012 contributions from the tfsa contribution room is made up of from this wording it means the 25 k you withdraw will go to the 2013 contribution room bullet 3   if you do n't re contribute it will roll over into the 2014 contribution room under bullet 2    for correctness i must add that i did not include any indexing of the annual amount

gt;however the caveat i will add is that if you go into debt for your education you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you   i agree but we 're not going to have that discussion when many parents do n't understand debt accurately and the ones that do are the ones whose kids are n't as likely to need big loans    gt;at the end of the day though these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to free aka subsidized education    the hyperinflation is n't because college costs are subsidized federal loans still have caps it 's because student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy in the vast majority of cases that means that private loans are available which means the federal loan caps are effectively useless    free college would have its challenges and we 'd need to make private loans in bankruptcy which would in turn make banks lend to only credit worthy students co signers using appropriate risk models but then we 'd also be able to make other adjustments    there are some things that we could probably be doing now but others might be too easily corruptible without the market correction of private loans only to those who are credit qualified   we could put more stringent requirements on grade point averages for example if you do n't hit that you do n't get your free college you can continue going if you go get private loans not able to qualify time to do something else then work and save for college trade school enter the workforce permanently etc this would n't work as well if private loans were still easily and non because there could be shady dealings to make more people not eligible for the free assistance with some type of crazy obstacles etc   we could do things like cap the costs for particular programs if you want to study mechanical engineering you can get up to x amount but if you 're studying early french you can only get up to y amount yes we could do that now but i do n't love the idea of putting those type of restrictions when it 's the student paying it seems a bit of an    there are lots of ways we could be addressing things but we are n't

the thing about the glide path is that the closer you 're to the retirement age the less risk you should be taking with your investments all investments carry risk but if you invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 20 and lose all your retirement money it will not have the same effect on your retirement as if you 'd invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 65 and then lose all your retirement money static allocation throughout your life without changing the risk factor will lead you to a very conservative investment path which would mean you 're not likely to lose your investments but you 're not likely to gain much either the point of the glide path is to allow you taking more risks early with more chances of higher gains but to limit your risks down the road also limiting your potential gains that is why it is always suggested to start your retirement funds early in your life to make sure you have enough time to invest in potentially high return stocks with high risk but when you get close to your retirement age it is advised to do exactly the opposite the date targeted funds do that for you but you can do it on your own as well as to the academic research you do n't need to go that far just look at the graphs to see that over long period investments in stocks give much better return than conservative bonds and treasuries especially when averaging the investments as it usually is with the retirement funds but over a given short period investments in stocks are much more likely to significantly lose in value

such an offer has negative value so it 's hard to see how it would make sense to accept it the offer has two components one part that you gain and one part that you lose the gain is that half your losses are covered the cost is that half your profits are lost for that to be a net benefit to you you would have to expect that you will gain more from this than you will lose from it that is you must expect that the investment has negative value but if you expect that the investment has negative value why are you investing this also does n't really align incentives between the two parties the person choosing the investment is not incurring opportunity cost because they have no funds locked up while you are so they have an incentive to be conservative that you do not for example say i could make 1 in an ultra low risk cd the person choosing the investments has an incentive to put me in something that he only expects to make around 0.5 because he gets to keep half the profits and it costs him nothing whereas i 'd rather just put the money in a cd because i get to keep 1 instead just half of 0.5

how does finra 's 5 markup policy   affect the expense profit value of an etf mutual fund   an extreme example to illustrate if my fund buys 100 ibm 100 the fund would credit the broker $ 10,000 for those shares and the broker would give the fund 100 shares additionally there would be some sort of commission say $ 10 paid on top of the transaction which would come out of the fund 's expense ratio   but the broker is allowed to charge a 5 markup so that means that $ 100 price that i see could have hit the tape at $ 95 assume 5 markup which is allowed thus assuming that the day had zero volatility for ibm   when the fund gets priced at the end of the day my 100 shares which cost 10,000 plus $ 10 now has a market value of $ 9,500 is that how it could work that 500 is n't calculated as part of the expense of the fund is it how could it be they do n't know about the exact value of the markup

if you are looking for money to speculate in the capital markets then your brokers will already lend to you at a much more favorable rate than an outside party will for instance with $ 4,000 you could easily control $ 40,000 with many brokers at a 1 interest rate this is 10:1 leverage much like how us banks operate every dollar that you deposit with them they speculate with 10x as much interactive brokers will do this for you with your current credit score they are very reputable and clear through goldman sachs so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world you wo n't have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything if you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 50:1 leverage as an american or as anyone else this means with only $ 400 dollars you can control $ 40,000 account if you are investing in the futures market then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates any contract you enter into is a loan from the market you have to understand that if you did happen to have $ 40,000 of your own money then you could get $ account size for speculating at 1 interest again these are quick ways to lose your money and owe a lot more so i 'd really advise against it a margin call in the futures market can destroy you i advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially and then speculate

this does n't answer your question but as an aside it 's important to understand that your second and third bullet points are completely incorrect while it used to be true that swiss bank accounts often came with guarantees of neutrality and privacy in recent years even the swiss banks have been to political pressure from many sides especially us obama with regards to the most extreme cases of criminals that is to say if you 're a terrorist or a child or in possession of nazi assets swiss banks wo n't provide the protection you 're interested in you might say but i 'm not a terrorist or a or profiteering of war crimes but if you 're trying so hard to hide your personal assets it 's worth wondering how much longer until swiss banks make further concessions to start providing information on not to discourage you this is just food for thought the bulletproof protection these accounts used to provide has been compromised i work with online advertising companies and a number of people i know in the industry get sued on a regular basis for copyright or trademark infringement or spamming most of these people still trust swiss bank accounts because it 's still the best protection available for their assets and because swiss banks have n't given up details on someone for spamming yet

i would n't classify your treatment as abuse medical billing has become more complex not less complex you need to learn to ask even more questions regarding expenses you probably need to see these price quotes in writing you did several things correctly staying in network generally is best because many plans have two deductible limits in network and out of network   you need to make sure that the insurance company does credit you with having paid the new patient fee that will qualify as an expense toward the deductible and your maximum out of pocket for the year some doctors offices do n't send to insurance companies items that they know will not be covered not remembering that these costs are critical under the high deductible plans with a health savings account doctors offices have problems determining how much the cost to you will be it depends not just on the insurance company but also which type of plan you have which sub plan you have and are you covered by more than one plan not to mention individual deductibles family deductibles and annual out of pocket amount all this is wanted prior to the doctor seeing the patient most doctors offices will work with you they know that each insurance plan treats each medical billing code differently sometimes they make a mistake talk to them

i really does depend on the bank here is a fairly typical page on interest calculations the key phrase is interest is calculated on each day 's final balance and paid monthly   so at the end of each day the amount of interest is calculated for that day based on how much is in the account at the end of the month the amount of interest for each day is and added to the account balance that calculation is extremely similar to duffbeer703 's compound monthly using the average balance for the month provided the account does n't have tiered interest rates and the balance does n't go negative the software that banks use is easily sophisticated enough to handle that kind of calculation your bank should be able to give you a statement of exactly how the interest is calculated

as joetaxpayer notes in his comment answers to this are really just opinions so here 's mine for what it 's worth if your risk tolerance is 5 out of 5 you should n't have anything in treasuries   those are basically the most conservative of all investments   this would probably mean no tips as well   if you 're more like 4.5 out of 5 you could have some but just a little a 30 allocation to government securities is quite conservative   if you want to diversify across different asset classes you could consider a bond fund like for instance vbmfx the vanguard total bond market index fund   your portfolio does n't currently contain any non government bonds which is something to consider 20 seems like quite a large allocation to reits   most sample portfolios i 've seen allocate no more than 10 to reits often no more than 5   there are some that have more like the 20 you 're but you might want to ponder that a bit more especially in light of your concerns about reits being at an all time high as for your question about all time highs it 's reasonable to think about but i think waiting for 30 50 off all time highs is unrealistic   looking at a chart of vfinx essentially the s&p 500 i see that at the of the recent downturn in early 2009 the market was at about 50 of its pre crash all time high   at the of the dot com bust the market was about 45 off its pre crash high   if you 're waiting for it to be 50 off it 's all time high you 're not just waiting for a good time to invest you 're waiting for a major crash it could certainly make sense not to immediately put everything into us stocks but that does n't mean you should put nothing in   as commented you could put some of the money in and then gradually add the rest over time reducing the risk of buying at the peak   this can also reduce the psychological of worrying about whether you 're doing the right thing which is worth taking into account   also note that if you get rid of the treasuries you eliminate a good chunk of the stuff that you thought was too close to the peak anyway your two basic points asset allocation and low cost funds have a strong boglehead flavor   you may already have looked at the bogleheads wiki if not you should take a look   if you are comfortable with that philosophy and i think it 's a sound one you should remember that part of that philosophy is not worrying about timing the market   you pursue a buy and hold strategy if you believe the market will go up in the long term and do n't care much about what it does in the short term   that said as mentioned above you might want to ease in your investment over time rather than buying all at once if only to avoid tearing your hair out if the market goes down in the short term incidentally your proposed portfolio is similar to this one that they mention although as i said above i think this is too conservative if you are 30 years old and consider yourself a 5 out of 5 in terms of risk tolerance   i 'm not sure if you already saw that in your research but since that portfolio apparently has a name and is known you might be able to find information about its risks and benefits by searching for discussion of it by name

the true answer is it depends because   it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card typically issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line says barry the consumer operations manager at fico the creator of the fico scoring formula the new account should have the old open date so you should retain your payment history he says the credit limit and balance should also stay the same how issuers report replacement cards we asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies american express the new card has the same open date and member since year as the previous card the balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number all payment history transfers over bank of america all transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal capital one the new account number with all the original account data original open date etc is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old   the two can then be into one so that all the applicable payment history balance etc is now under the new account number chase the original does not change the history on the account remains just the account number field is updated with the new account number there is no new in this scenario

your question indicates that you might have a little confusion about put options and/or leveraging   there 's no sense i 'm aware of in which purchasing a put levers a position   purchasing a put will cost you money up front   leveraging typically means entering a transaction that gives you extra money now that you can use to buy other things   if you meant to sell a put that will make money up front but there is no possibility of making money later   best case scenario the put is not exercised   the other use of the term leverage refers to purchasing an asset that proportionally goes up faster than the value of the underlying   for example a call option if you purchase a put you are buying downside protection which is kind of the opposite of leverage   notice that for an american put you will most likely be better off selling the put when the price of the underlying falls than exercising it   that way you make the money you would have made by exercising plus whatever optional value the put still contains   that is true unless the time value of money is greater than the optional insurance value   since the time value of money is currently exceptionally low this is unlikely   anyway if you sell the option instead of exercising you do n't need to own any shares at all   even if you do exercise you can just buy them on the market and sell right away so i would n't worry about what you happen to be holding the rules for what you can trade with a cash instead of a margin account vary by broker i think   you can usually buy puts and calls in a cash account but more advanced strategies such as writing options are prohibited   ask your broker or check their help pages to see what you have available to you

the cause of the increase in 2006 2011 was the financial crisis where if you recall the global banking system came close to collapse for reasons that are well documented rightly or wrongly gold is seen as a safe haven asset in times of crisis the price of gold began to decline in 2011 when the markets decided that the risk of a global banking system collapse had passed without further incident in the period leading up to 2006 the price of gold was in a flat to down trend because there was little net buying interest in gold and large gold sales had been executed by various central banks around the world who felt that gold no longer had a place in central bank reserves    in modern economies gold is seen as a fringe asset   it has no role to play   the recent financial crisis may have that perception but those dents are now being forgotten and the price of gold is returning to its long term downward trend   when the next financial banking crisis is upon us the price of gold will again probably rally   the extent of the rally will depend on the extent of the crisis

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

like everybody else i 'm picking up on the school loans you 're mother is n't exactly earning a massive amount of money given her cost of living why is she taking out student loans that benefit you and your sister i 'm not trying to be offensive but it 's fairly obvious that she ca n't afford it as a first step i think you should at least take over paying your own student loans you sound like you 're out of college already and if you have $ 8k to lend to your mother you probably have enough money to pay the student loans that benefited you after all or as someone else also recommended assume your loans as to your sister maybe it 's time for her to get another job to pay for the tuition so her mother does n't have to go further into debt again i 'm not trying to be mean here but your mother is digging herself deeper and deeper into a hole because of the tuition something 's got ta give and delivering pizza or getting a paper round is a small sacrifice here next the car unless she has a managed to work herself out of some of this mess i would consider getting a much cheaper car instead this is provided that she is n't upside down on the loan personally i would n't trade in a vehicle with an upside down loan if anything that 's another bad financial decision assuming that she is n't upside down on the loan and has some equity in the car i would seriously consider selling the car and using the equity to buy something small and cheap that should also hopefully reduce the cost of gas and maybe insurance somewhat i think these points are probably the quickest steps that can be taken towards recovering this situation you already mentioned the longer term plans like downsizing the apartment but tbh i 'm not sure that this is really necessary the big elephant in the room are the college costs and removing those from the equation would give her a serious amount of breathing room

if you 're able to pop this data into excel you can quickly calculate the solution every one of these problems boils down to interest rate term payment present value and future value fv will typically be zero excel has a formula to calculate any of these components based off of the other inputs    in this case the given information is interest rate   term 36 months monthly pmt $ 350 present value    you can use the = pv formula and input the other known values one caveat is that you 'll need to adjust the interest rate to account for the monthly compounding so the formula would be = this gives a result of $ which is the amount you 'd be able to borrow all of these can also be solved on the + but i do n't have my old calculator on me to walk through the steps   to calculate the total interest paid you would then find out how much you 'll be paying over the life of the loan if your monthly payment is $ 350 for 36 months the total amount you 'd pay is $ 12,600 $ 350 36 subtract the $ calculated in step one and you are left with $ worth of interest    hope that makes sense let me know if you want me to go over any of the steps in more detail as a former finance student i would highly recommend locking down the tvm functions as they will pop up quite often throughout your schooling career    best of luck

there is no need for micropayments monthly payments or harassment   a loan agreement can be drafted that your mom makes one payment annually to you instead of monthly payments depending on what she and you might be comfortable   with this payment could be interest only or partly interest and part repayment   of principal   or you can set it up so that there is a balloon payment due when   the loan say in five years time and she pays back the entire   principal and accumulated interest if you trust her to pay back the money   you do n't need to ask for collateral or security and you do n't need to turn the debt over to a collection agency or send large men with baseball bats to call on mom if you just want mom to return the principal when she is ready to so so and do n't really want to charge her interest then set up the loan to require annual payment of interest only and the entire principal at   the end of the agreement then each year a few days before the   interest payment is due send her a check for the interest due as a gift   mom deposits the check in her account and sends back the interest payment to you so no harm no foul you have   made her a gift presumably less than the $ 13 k exemption she has paid you interest but there is no net transfer of money and as far as the irs are concerned this is a legitimate loan do keep copies of the paperwork though and be sure to report the interest payment on your income tax returns as income to you by extension if you do n't really want the money back set up the loan so that the annual payment is $ 13 k and is part the annual interest due and part the principal until the loan is paid off

short answer go to the bank and ask them about your options for opening a business account talk to an attorney about the paperwork and company structure and taxes long answer you and your buddies jointly own an unincorporated business this is called a partnership yes there is paperwork involved in doing it properly and the fact that you guys are minors might complicate that paperwork a little bit in terms of what type of account to open a business account running a business through a personal account joint or otherwise is a sure way to get that account shut down your bank will want to know the structure of the business and will require documentation to support that for a partnership they will probably want a copy of the partnership agreement for an llc they 'll probably want a copy of the filing with ohio secretary of state as well as the operating agreement etc that said pop into a local bank and ask a business banker directly what you should do they deal with new businesses all the time and would probably be best qualified to help you figure out the bank account aspect of it regarding business structure this really impacts a lot more than just the type of bank account to open and how you file your taxes it is something you guys should really discuss with an attorney what happens if down the road one of you quits what happens if you want to bring in a new partner later   what if there is a disagreement about something   these are all things that the attorney can help you address ahead of time which is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than trying to figure it out later you 're in enough that you should certainly be able to buy a couple hours of a lawyer 's time getting the formation stuff right could save all of you a lot of money and later

wow all the answers here are a joke retained earnings is a funding side liabilities + equity of the balance sheet accounting entry it 's a residual value so if you end up funding your assets with more liabilities for example then retained earnings will be smaller   when worrying about the funding side of the balance sheet you should consider mainly 1 how much you want in the business of your own money equity and 2 how much debt your business can support as well as how much debt you 're comfortable with   2 is a function of looking at your income generating capacity once you 've figured out how much you will fund with debt you then need the remainder to be your money some of this is contributed capital the rest is retained earnings so to wonder about how much in retained earnings to have is n't really the way to think about it you should have the debt vs. equity conversation with yourself and figure it out that way do n't worry about the components of equity if you 're a sole owner and it 's all yours there are other ways to finance equity like preferred shares but for all intents and purposes this is a small business   from a risk perspective retained earnings is largely irrelevant on a standalone basis you should pay far more attention to your assets for example if you asked how much cash or working capital do i need that 's an operational question that 's very important to know for running the business it can be debated and there is a right answer retained earnings is just a partial accounting entry of equity and can even be manipulated by repurchasing shares and then contributing more capital so i would n't focus on it

fyi i 'm not a lawyer i would not try to reverse the transfer   you need to create a paper trail as to what happened to this money and why   be sure to document whatever you do reach out again reach out to the company again and see if you can transfer the money back to their account   a wire transfer is $ 20 usually be sure to negotiate the company covering this and every other fee if you can not reach them you could probably move the money to an escrow account at your new bank   the new bank will likely be able to advise you on the best way do this   you should probably also send a letter via certified mail to ensure they received it informing them you 've done this and how to get in touch with you by putting the money in an escrow account you 've proven that you have n't used it and if the company wants it back its very obvious who 's money it is   sending the certified mail someone must sign for it will also create a paper trail that will help you if things get ugly finally do n't spend it

why is that with all the successful investors including myself on a not infrequent basis going for individual companies directly would n't it make more sense to suggest that new investors learn how to analyse companies and then make their best guess after taking into account those factors i have a different perspective here than the other answers   i recently started investing in a roth ira for retirement i do not have interest in micromanaging individual company research i do n't find this enjoyable at all but i know i want to save for retirement could i learn all the details probably as an engineer software person i suspect i could but i really do n't want to but here 's the thing for anyone else in a similar situation to me the net return on investing into a mutual fund type arrangement even if it returns only 4 is still likely considerably higher than the return on trying to invest in stocks which likely results in $ 0 invested and a return of 0 i suspect the overwhelming majority of people in the world are more similar to me than you in that they have minimal interest in spending hours managing their money for us mutual funds or etfs are perfect for this
