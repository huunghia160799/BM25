according to this post on turbotax forums you could deduct it as an unreimbursed employee expense this would seem consistent with the irs guidelines on such deductions an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business an expense does not have to be required to be considered necessary office rent is not listed explicitly among the examples of deductible unreimbursed employee expenses but this does n't mean it 's not allowed   of course you should check with a tax professional if you want to be sure

i disagree with i do n't think this is qualified as unreimbursed employee expense for it to qualify it has to be ordinary and necessary and specifically necessary for your employer this is not the case for you as there 's no such necessity from employer 's perspective you can work from your home just as well in fact the expense is your personal as it is your choice not unreimbursed employee expense since your employer did n't even ask you to do it you should clarify this with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in new york

if you are a and in good terms with your employer then all you need is contact your employer and explain your situation ask them for a short letter that indicates 1 they require you to work from a privately rented office or from a home office for those who prefer working from home 2 this is one of the terms of your employment and 3 they will not reimburse you for this expense with this letter in your hand you both the convenience of employer test and the deduction of the rent for your private office as a unreimbursed employee expense   the irs can not expect your employer to open an office branch in your city just for your sake nor can they expect you to commute to your employer 's city for work which is an considering the distance additionally the irs can not force to work from home the key is to get a letter from your employer you 'd be surprised how easily they are willing to write such letter for you

i like a devil 's advocate   gt amazon made a brick and mortar acquisition which will now have a direct effect on consumers by trying to hamper which sites their customers try to access while on wifi and can also be seen as anticompetitive   this statement assumes that amazon intends to use the patented technology despite no evidence of such intent at the time of filing at the time the patent was granted which amazon has no control over or at the time of the wf purchase announcement   your reasoning has merit the patent only became relevant when amazon acquired an opportunity to use it    however it relies on assumptions that are n't necessarily correct or complete hence it is n't an objectively correct conclusion by any means    by including only the fact that the patent was recently granted timing lined up with wf acquisition the author promoted the idea that the patent is part of amazon 's plan with wf going forward    amazon may now have plans for using it in connection with wf or it may absolutely not there is presently working from the article itself no evidence to suggest any such plans exist outside the author 's mind i have zero doubt that they have considered using it btw i refer to actual plans to implement   i may be old fashioned or but the correct way to frame the situation is always completely and accurately including all relevant information     this allows readers to review the information and draw their own conclusions even if the journalist also shares his own conclusion

it 's not impossible to forecast the future price of a commodity however it 's exactly that an educated guess much like the weather and the further out that prediction is made the higher the percentage error is expected a lot of information is gathered by various instruments etc at a very high cost of time and money to produce a prediction that starts breaking down after about five days and is no more than a wild guess after about ten how accurately a price can be forecast depends on the commodity there are seasonal and thus cyclical changes in many commodities on top of which there is a general trend which is nearer term a pretty decent prediction can thus be arrived at with a relatively simple seasonally adjusted percentage change algorithm take a moving average of the last few measurements compute the percent change versus the same period last year current minus last divided by last and multiply it by last year 's number for the current day or month to arrive at a pretty decent prediction for the current and near future periods up to about as far ahead as you have looked behind another thing you may need to do is normalize many price graphs are very the price of a stock may fluctuate many percentage points on a single day and there 's a lot of noise inherent in them a common tool to normalize is a box and plot which for a given time period will aggregate all samples within that period and give you a measurement of the lowest sample highest sample median and the range of each 25 of the full sample space box plots can also be plotted on the range or middle fifty this throws away the very noisy outliers and a much more regular plot from the inner part of the bell curve you can reverse engineer a best fit line connecting the elements of each box and the closer two lines are the more likely the real future data will be around that area because the between those to lines is very dense 25 of the values are in a very small range meaning many samples occurred there lastly there are outside factors that are not included in simple percentage growth big news must be taken into account by introducing more subjective guesses about future data if you see an active hurricane season coming or a hurricane bearing down on houston then it 's reasonable to assume that the price of oil and/or refined oil products like gas and jet fuel will skyrocket a cyclical growth model will not predict these events but you can factor in the likelihood of a big change with a base onto which you add last year 's numbers and onto that you add regular growth conversely when a huge spike happens due to a non cyclical event like a natural disaster you must smooth it out by reducing the readings to fit in the curve otherwise your model for next year will expect the same anomaly at the same time and so it will be wrong these adjustments are necessary but the more of them you make the less the graph reflects real history and the more it reflects what you think it should have been

john 's answer is great the question however is complex enough that one can write a book on the topic   so i 'll take the liberty to add two observations the matched 401(k should be the priority even before paying off one 's credit cards if any a dollar for dollar match combined with the extra years of compounding is worth a bit longer on the debt pay off to a younger person the roth either roth 401(k or ira is a good choice while you are in a lower tax bracket i recommend you look at the page at fairmark to understand the tax brackets it 's easy to see how many people straddle that 15 line at $ 68 k taxable and with a bit of planning using roth while in the 15 bracket and deductible accounts as you go above you can tax manage your affairs to avoid the higher rates

the point is to provide for yourself in retirement so it makes sense that these withdrawals would be penalized tax deferred accounts are usually created for a specific cause using them outside of the scope of that cause triggers penalties you mentioned 401(k and ira that have age limitations because they 're geared towards retirement in the us here are other types and if you intend to spend money in the related areas they may be worth considering otherwise you 'll hit penalties as well examples hsa health savings account allows saving pre tax contributions and gains towards medical expenses you must have a high deductible health plan to be eligible can be used as ira once retired 529 plans allow saving pre tax gains and in some states pre tax contributions for education expenses for you or a beneficiary if a beneficiary contributions are considered a gift there 's a tax benefit in long term investing in a regular taxable brokerage accounts long term capital gains are taxed at a preferable lower rate than short term or ordinary income the difference may be significant long term = 1 + year holding the condition here is holding an investment for more than a year and there 's no penalty for not satisfying it but there 's a reward lower rates if you do

buying pressure means there are more interested buyers than there are ready sellers putting upward pressure on prices that might include institutional buyers who are slowly executing buy orders because they still want the best prices possible without clearing out the market buying pressure does n't have to be related to volume at all if everyone who owns shares think they are going to be worth far more than recent market prices they will not offer them for sale that means there is more demand to buy than there is a supply of shares to be bought that condition can exist regardless of trading volume

in the case of an initial public offering the brokers underwriting the share issue will look at the current earnings being generated by the company and compare these to those of other competitor companies already listed in the stock market   for example if a new telephone company is undertaking an initial public offering then the share price of those telephone companies which are already traded on the stock market will serve as a reference for how much investors will be willing to pay for the new company 's shares   if investors are willing to pay 15 times earnings for telecom shares then this will be the benchmark used in determining the new share price in addition comparative growth prospects will be taken into account   finally the underwriter will want to see a successful sale so they will tend to slightly under price the new shares in order to make them attractive none of this is an exact science and we often see shares trading at a large premium to the initial offer price during the first few days of trading   more often that not prices then settle down to something closer to the offer price   the initial price spike is usually the result of high demand for the shares by investors who believe that past examples of a price spike will repeat with this initial public offering   there will also usually be high demand for the new shares from funds that specialise in shares of the type being issued in the case of a rights issue where an existing publicly traded company wishes to raise capital by issuing new shares the company will price the new shares at a significant discount to the current market price   the new shares will be initially offered to existing shares holders and the discounted price is intended to encourage the existing shareholders to exercise their rights since the new shares may have the effect of diluting the value of their shares   any shares which are not purchased by existing share holder will then be offered for sale in the market

it 's pretty simple the 10 is any savings for retirement   preferably it 's in a retirement account but that 's not mandatory it 's great that you save for a vacation computer house deposit etc but that 's not what these articles are referencing   edit in response to the running comments on 's answer the mortgage issue is worth further discussion i 'm saving toward a home purchase it may be $ 50 k saved but that 's not money for retirement the house savings never is i get the $ 200 k mortgage my balance sheet is net neutral less fees closing costs of course but my retirement savings again is unchanged i put $ 10 k toward principal the balance sheet again is $ 10 k better but retirement account unchanged last i pay off the mortgage retirement account unchanged but my retirement budget requirement is $ 1000/mo less the mortgage payment and my number drops by $ 300 k or so this is based on the 4 rule to withdraw $ 1000/mo requires $ 300 k in retirement assets it may seem pedantic but there 's an important distinction to be made here it 's easy to distinguish retirement savings from all other wise financial transactions paying debt off is wise but not retirement savings any actions that reduce your ongoing expenses clearly wise and it reduces the number needed to cover your retirement budget but it 's distinct from retirement savings for those that enjoy the intellectual exercise of insisting there 's always a grey area i 'll give it to you the family with 3 kids in the $ 1.2 m 5 bedroom house the parents know they will move into their paid off summer house upon retiring and sell this family house in his wisdom hubby has planned for the mortgage to be paid in full well ahead of retirement and for purposes of planning only view the house as worth $ the house does have a relationship to the retirement savings but the action of planning for alice 's retirement the maid they will no longer need once they move is not savings but rather an adjustment down in their retirement budget   i think you 'll find most conflicts regarding this issue resolved by understanding this distinction

this is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point   first google and others essentially have in house investment banking departments that are vetting valuing negotiating and sealing these deals these m&amp;a guys are mostly former bankers    so while they may not be using investment banks they are certainly using bankers google has $ in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year it 's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in house    second certain tech companies like google and facebook and zynga have unique corporate structures where the ceo founders retain majority voting control of their companies    this means guys like zuckerberg page brin et al control over 50 of all voting shares and they can not be ousted by the board of directors nor can they be on any matter via a proxy battle this gives these founders far reaching control over m&amp;a and thus you see deals like the $ cash + stock whatsapp acquisition and instagram both of these deals were reportedly driven by zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals but determined the price    most ceos do not have this kind of latitude    third within silicon valley the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other the ceos founders vcs etc they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire   it 's not like zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out snapchat

first off is right at the end of the day you should not accept what anyone says to do without your money take their suggestions as directions to research and decide for yourself   i also do not think what you have is too little to invest but that depends on how liquid you need to be   often in order to make a small amount of money grow via investments you have to be willing to take all the investment profits from that principle and reinvest it   thus can you see how your investment ability is governed by the time you plan to spend without that money   they mantra that i have heard from many people is that the longer you are able to wait the more risk you can take   as someone who is about the same age as you i 'm 24 i ca n't exactly say yet that what i have done is sure fire for the long term but i suggest you adopt a few principles 1 go read a random walk down wall street by burton g. malkiel   a key point for you might be that you can do better than most of these professional investors for hire simply by putting   more money in a well selected index fund   for example vanguard is a nice online service to buy indexes through but they may require a minimum   2 since you are young if you go into any firm bank or financial planner they will just think you are naive and try to get you to buy whatever is best for them one of their mutual funds money market accounts annuities some flashy cd    do n't   you can do better on your own and while it might be tempting because these options look more secure or well managed most of the time you will barely make above inflation and you will not have learned very much 3 one exciting thin you should start learning now is about algorithmic trading because it is cool and super efficient is a good platform for this   it is a fun community and it is also free 4 one of the best ways i have found to watch the stock market is actually through a stock game app on my phone that has realtime stock price feed   seeking alpha has a good mobile app interface and it also connects you to news that has to do with the companies you are interested in

let 's say that you want to invest in the stock market   choosing and investing in only one stock is risky   you can lower your risk by diversifying or investing in lots of different stocks   however you have some problems with this   when you buy stocks directly you have to buy whole shares and you do n't have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in you are n't even sure which stocks you should buy a mutual fund solves both of these problems   you get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks   that way your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one   and the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in so you do n't have to pick there are lots of mutual funds to choose from with as many different objectives as you can imagine   some invest in large companies others small some invest in a certain sector of companies utilities or health care for example some invest in stocks that pay a dividend others are focused on growth   some funds do n't invest in stocks at all they might invest in bonds real estate or precious metals   some funds are actively managed where the manager actively buys and sells different stocks in the fund continuously and takes a fee for his services and others simply invest in a list of stocks and rarely buy or sell these are called index funds to answer your question yes the jpmorgan emerging markets equity fund is a mutual fund   it is an actively managed stock mutual fund that attempts to invest in growing companies that do business in countries with rapidly developing economies

how would the rrsp know where the money came from you have two separate financial operations going on you invest some money within the limits set by the law in a tax free savings account   near the end of the year you take the money plus interest out of the account   as you may guess by the name you need not report the interest as income there are no restrictions on the money except that you ca n't put it back in the tfsa until the new year   the money is not segregated or frozen or marked with an exploding dye pack   it 's just money in your regular bank account or your pocket or under your mattress during that year you also work for a salary   some is deducted from your salary to prepay your tax responsibilities subject to a final calculation you spend some and save some   the money you save also goes into your bank account your pocket or under your mattress you can even take some of your money from your chosen repository and put it in a rrsp which the need to pay tax on the original deposit and on any earnings on the deposit   the money you take has lost all sense of identity   it is n't tfsa money or salary or paper route money or birthday money   it 's just money

you can be a co borrower on the property that your father owns some banks require that you also be part owner of the property some banks do not require this you can take a home loan for a new property normally banks will ask you of all your current loans auto other home etc to determine the amount they will be ready to lend edit the first loan i believe your father already has a property in his name your father can apply for loan against property if he does not have sufficient income then you can guarantee the loan ie co sign on the loan some banks allow this however there is no tax benefit on this loan      the second is the home loan for the balance amount that you would get it both the loans can be taken from the same bank there would be a overall cap as to the amount of loan a bank would give depending on your income further the finance for this house will only be to the extent of 80 of the value

short answer yes for federal income tax purposes you are taxed on your total income adding up positives and negatives if business a made say $ 100,000 while business b lost $ 20,000 then your total income is $ 80,000 and that 's what you 'll be taxed on as @littleadv says of course any business losses you claim must qualify as business losses under irs rules and yes there are special rules about losses that the irs considers passive if you have wage income in addition to business income business losses do n't offset wage income for social security and medicare tax purposes you ca n't get a refund of the social security tax deducted from your paycheck i do n't know if this is relevant to you but if you have businesses in different states each is taxed by that state for example i have two tiny side businesses one in michigan and one in ohio last year the michigan business made money while the ohio business lost money so my federal income was michigan minus ohio my ohio income was negative so i owed no ohio income tax but i could n't subtract my ohio losses from my michigan income for michigan income tax purposes thus having say $ 10,000 income in michigan and $ 10,000 in ohio would result in lower taxes than $ 30,000 income in michigan and a $ 10,000 loss in ohio even though the total income in both cases is the same and this would be true even if the tax rates in both states were identical

you should probably call the travel agency and complain not that they will care but if by any chance they do they can ask paypal to remove the block this is what is called authorization pending usually a credit card transaction has two stages the merchant requests its payment processor to authorize the transaction the processor will contact the card issuer with the transaction details and will get the authorization code which will be passed to the merchant at that stage the transaction enters the pending stage on your account the merchant submits the transaction and gets the money from its payment processor who forwards the transaction to the card issuer and gets the money from there the card issuer charges the card owner the transaction should have the same authorization code received in step 1 and by matching it to the pending transaction the card issuer removes the pending transaction and posts the actual transaction however if the transaction in step 2 does n't include the code from step 1 the match does n't occur and you see the situation you have now both the actual transaction and the pending are active in this case the merchant should contact its merchant processor and request the of the authorization code the processor will then forward the request to the card issuer who will then remove the pending transaction as you can see multiple parties have to actually care for that to happen and many times they do n't because they do n't have to as to the period it 's up to the card issuer paypal in your case but 1 month is a very long time usually it 's about a week or two unless it 's a hotel car rental in any case once it expires it will go away on its own and if you do n't mind for the amounts to be blocked until then just let it expire the fact that you used a debit card for this transaction is irrelevant unless it was a pin transaction debit card transactions are processed as credit card transactions by processors for pin transactions there process is different and you should n't see doubles if it was a pin transaction contact paypal and check with them what 's going on generally paypal is not to be used as a bank account it is merely a payment processor and it is advised to remove the money from there as soon as possible

there are several disadvantages you can not generally withdraw from a 401(k while you 're still employed at the same employer when you do withdraw then unless you roll it over you pay tax on the whole amount based on the marginal tax rate you have that year if it comes on top of your regular salary the whole withdrawal will be taxed at the higher marginal rates you will also pay extra 10 penalty for the withdrawal for home purchase you can take out up to $ 10 k without the penalty i doubt that would be enough for downpayment there are probably more but these are the major ones i can spot the same goes to the except that those do n't have the 10 penalty

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

i think of these things in terms of risk   investing in individual stocks is risky and investing in brand new individual stocks is riskier still however the payoff can be quite high   the fact that you work at the company increases your exposure if the company goes under then not only have you lost your investment but you 've lost your job and income as well   it really depends on how much of your total portfolio this investment represents consider the following if you can say yes to all or most of these then a small investment in your company is fine if you end up losing your investment you 'll still be okay   i think it can help a company when the employees have a little skin in the game i hope it pays out big for you

rolling an old 401k into a new 401k is generally only for ease of management for example how many bank accounts do you really want as long as the funds are reasonably allocated i 've found it can be a useful mind game to leave it separate sometimes it 's desirable to ignore an account and let it grow and it is a nice surprise when finally adding all the account balances together in other words i keep thinking i 've got x the amount of my biggest or current 401k which affects helps my habits and desire to save when i add them all together i 'm shocked to find out i 've got y the total of all accounts personally i 've had big paperwork problems transferring an old 403b same type process as 401k even when i had an adviser helping me move it in the end it was worth moving it because i 'm having the adviser manage it i 'm actually writing this answer specifically because i recently moved a big 401k into a traditional ira a rep from the brokerage representing my previous employer kept calling me to find out how they could help i did n't brush him off i found that using an ira provided me with the opportunity to do self guided investments in funds or even individual stocks well beyond the limited selection of the old company 's 401k it was useful interesting to me to invest in low fee vehicles such as index funds ie the buffett recommendation and i 'll find some stocks as well oh and when the old company 401k has certain funds being discontinued i did n't want to notice the mandated changes years later so i 'd suggest you consider management and flexibility of the 401k or equivalent and any of your special personal circumstances goals if you end up with a few retirement accounts i suggest you use an account aggregating website to see or follow your net worth i know many who based on various concerns and their portfolio find an acceptable website to use

i think you 're on the wrong track   getting more and more samples from the real world does not make your backtest more accurate it just confirms that your strategy can withstand one particular sample path of a stochastic process the reason why you find it simple to incorporate fees commissions taxes etc is because they 're a static and constant process well they might change over time but most definitely uncorrelated to the markets modelling overnight returns or the top levels of the order book the next day is serious work   first you have to select a suitable model that 's mostly theoretical work but experience can help a lot   then in order to do it data driven you 'd have to through thousands of days of sample data on a set of thousands of instruments to get a feeling aka significant model parameters    data mining i think excel might be the wrong tool for the job   data even just the first 10 levels is a massive   for example the nyse historical data weighs in at a massive 15 tb compressed 74 tb for the last 10 years and costs usd 200k   anyway as for other factors to take into account so how to account for all this in a backtest   personally i would put in some penalty terms as on a return basis for every factor you want to consider do n't them   you can then run a stress test by exploring these parameters i.e. assign some values in the range of 0 to whatever fits   explore them individually only set one penalty term at a time to get a feeling how the strategy might react to stress from that factor   then you can run the backtest with typical or observed combinations of penalty factors and slowly stress them altogether edit just to avoid confusion about terminology   a backtest in the strict sense had i implemented this strategy x years ago what would have happened wo n't benefit from any modelling simply because the real world does the sampling for us however to evaluate a strategy 's you should account for the additional factors and run some stress tests   if the strategy performs well in the real world or no stress scenario but produces losses once a tiny slippage occurs every now and again you could conclude that the strategy is very fragile   the key is to explore the maximum stress the strategy can handle by whatever measure if a lot you can call the strategy robust the latter is what i personally call a backtest the first procedure would go by the name extension towards the past or so some lightweight literature

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

gt;i think you mean 60 of all mortgages on homes in nevada are underwater not every home has a mortgage so it 's not 60 of the homes it 's 60 of the mortgages   spot on in the us typically somewhere around 30 to 40 of homes have no mortgage at all i.e. 100 equity by the owners   so if nevada follows the us average which it may not having a lot of new developments then 60 of would be somewhere between 36 to 42 of homes   that of course is still huge if even 10 of homes in a locale are distressed sales it is enough to drive prices down   but another caveat is that just because a place is underwater does not mean that it has a high negative equity point of fact is that any home bought with an ltv mortgage or a really low down payment i.e. 0 to 10 down payment is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years    why because typical realtor fees are around 6 and closing costs are easily another couple of percent add in that with a self amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years and any loss for aging and owner cash out equity can easily be near zero or negative   that 's one of the reasons you should n't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years because it takes that long to recoup the realtor amp closing costs ergo the whole flipping is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

first of all the numbers you give are most probably nowhere near the total expenses you have need to budget   maybe you should have a look at the expenses you had over the last years look at how much money came in and how much went to the savings and compare this expenses to the sum of all the expenses you have on your list of expenses as check just starting on some numbers you give and assuming the house is the main goal   house of 300 500 k€ assuming downpayment of 30 40 i.e. somewhere between 90 and 200 i 'll go on calculating with 150 k€ which would be 50 of 300 k€ or 30 of 500 you want to be there in 8 15 a this means saving 10 19 k€ per year 19 is clearly impossible with 20 k€ net wage   10 k€ with 20 k€ net wage means a savings quote of 50 so for each € you spend one goes towards the house this is doable in the sense that if you continue with 4 for rent plus a 4 (= 400 € style of life that would put you to 9 k€ expenses a thus 1 k€ saving for unexpected disaster i 'd actually first get a couple of k€ together for such things and then go as much as possible towards the house still this is not the life style the rest of your goals sounds like   you can update this somewhat with the expected income of your girlfriend wife but remember that she needs food and clothes as well and you assume she 'll need a car of her own let me rephrase the savings goal of 150 k€ you 'd try to save 3 times the median german household equity within 8 to 15 years this should tell you that it is a very steep proposition on the other hand e.g. manage to have a median household equity of ca 60 k€ out of a median income that is roughly half the median income in germany so again it is somehow possible but it will be really tough to live a life style like a or between peers that spend roughly everything good approximation as we 're talking about savings rates   above 50 of net income they earn    i think the easiest way to get your savings going is to postpone lifestyle upgrades   on the other hand around 150 k€ would buy you a complete new house of the same size that costs 300 500 k€ around so if you really want to go for the house i 'd recommend not only to save as hard as you can but also to look out for possibilities to relocate to a cheaper area 8 15 years should be enough time to decide what area you 'd like and then to look for an opportunity without too much pressure and actually this should be enough time so that also your girlfriend wife could get herself transferred to another in reality saving as hard as possible will probably get you nowhere near 150 k€ there are very few people who manage to do this though they exist but if you get to 75 k€ that would mean a reasonably good position for both starting negotiations with the bank about buying a 150 k€ house plus the corresponding payment of the mortgage if you get there within less than 15 years that would also leave some air in case you change opinion with regard to kids and then leaves a reasonable amount of time to put together your pension   consider your psychology about saving towards the house even if both of you know that you want it really hard it may be good to enter a building savings contract 15 years should be reasonable for that way which will enforce you to keep up the savings rate and also does not allow you to divert money for other purposes however i 'd say that 6 months into the first job it may be a bit early to fix such savings rates maybe for the beginning a savings account that includes some hassle to get the money out again set low limit and allow any outgoing money to go only to another account of yours with an automatic savings deposit every month is a way how to safely determine the savings rate you can manage maybe you can use this to first put together your new emergency savings which should be first priority anyways   if you want to cut expenses in order to save look at the recommendations for people who try to get out of debt budget your expenses cook yourself and enjoy this maybe taking a cooking class together with your girlfriend is a lot of fun leads to food that may even be more to your taste than restaurant stuff and is much cheaper keep book pay in cash not by card and so on   if you 're not a diy person try whether you could enjoy becoming one no magic involved there   i guess the most important point is to find out how much you want the house and then how hard you are willing to save this is something only you and your girlfriend can decide together   imho you really do n't need to invest unless you drop the house plan you need to save towards your goals you may decide to invest a small part of the money while saving in order to learn slowly how that works but if the house goal is already kind of fixed in time you do n't want to find yourself in the situation that you have to get out of investments at a bad time in order to be able to buy the house even if you consider 15 years long enough to do some investing now and then get out some time during the next 15 years you do n't have any money to invest now later the risk posed by the fixed point in time when you need the money is too large considering the rather steep saving propositions the marginal costs of having less money are really large this means you do n't want to go for risky investments = > plain old saving is what you need consider also that low house prices tend to come during economic crisis people can not pay mortgage and have to sell so within the time window you want to have your money for buying if possible

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

i too have worked in both small and large companies i started with the small ones and am currently at a big one i agree with all of your points about the upside of working for small companies some of the upsides i find at the big company where i work are   there are people around you that know more than you do there is a huge opportunity to learn from them which is a lot harder when you 're the lone expert at a company you rely on whatever you can scrape up from the internet etc most people learn faster with good mentoring   there is money to spend on things that you need no raised from the ceo when you say that you need a $ 20 lamp for your desk or even more serious issues like adequate hardware for what you need to do getting tools you need etc less of an issue at a vc funded startup until the money starts running low   there are entire teams that help with things like documentation customer support sales tools and other things which frees me up to do what i 'm good at which is making software   i remember reading some advice a while ago that still rings true to me which is that there is n't a single right place to work small large etc the right thing to do is get experience with a variety of different environments in the end you 'll be stronger for it

if the share is listed on a stock exchange that creates liquidity and orderly sales with specialist market makers such as the nyse there will always be a counterparty to trade with though they will let the price rise or fall to meet other open interest   on other exchanges or in closely held or private equity scenarios this is not necessarily the case nasdaq has market maker firms that maintain the bid ask spread and can do the same thing with their own inventory as the specialists but are not required to by the brokerage rules as the nyse brokers are   the nyse has listing requirements of at least 1.1 million shares so there will not be a case with only 100 shares on this exchange

checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

imagine two restaurants one has prices 15 higher than the other and the owner pays this 15 to his wait staff in the form of higher wages the other has lower prices but the average customer gifts 15 to their waiter clearly in the first restaurant the 15 the wait staff receives is taxable income it is traditional salary what legitimate economic justification is their for treating the second restaurant any differently imagine a grocery store in a small town that offered long time customers a pay nothing option but made it clear that they 'd be subject to social and no longer welcome in the store if they did n't gift 85 of the usual cost of the items the customers would save on sales tax and the grocer would argue that all that money was gifts not income of course this does n't work the irs and the laws do n't care very much about what you call things they care about the underlying economic reality if the money was part of the payment for the services rendered regardless of how it was delivered what the parties called it or whether the obligation to pay was legal or social it 's still a payment for the service and it 's still taxable you would have to be able to argue to the irs that it really was a gift and was n't any form of payment for the service received otherwise it 's just a scheme to evade taxes

the real estate agent industry is a cartel   they seek to keep fees high even as their services are becoming less and less necessary   to that end traditional seller 's agents will laugh at your attempt to negotiate their fee   they can do this quite simply because the industry is designed so the vast majority of people think of buyer 's agents as free even when they are anything but free that being said the only way to do what you 're trying to do is to find a buyer 's agent who will rebate to you a portion of the commission they receive   it is extremely extremely unlikely you 'll get a seller 's agent to play ball especially once they know you 're interested   you can check out which connects people to re agents that rebate commissions but the buyer 's cut is n't that high   your best bet imo is to contact agents in your area before you go shopping to see what kind of rebate you can negotiate with them a word of caution if you look at a house without your own agent instead asking the seller 's agent to show the house they will claim procuring clause and you 'll be sunk   in other words once they claim procuring clause you ca n't later go back and get a discount broker to get the commission to rebate to you

other people have already demonstrated the effect of compound interest to the question i 'd like to add a totally different perspective   note that the article says if you can follow this simple recipe throughout your working career you will almost certainly beat out most professional investors you 'll likely accumulate enough savings to retire comfortably the latter point may be the more practical mark than the somewhat arbitrary million rupees dollars my point here is that the group of people who do put away a substantial fraction of their lower early wages and keep them invested for decades show at least two traits that will make a very substantial difference to the average western person they may be correlated though people who are not tempted or able to resist the temptation to spend almost their whole income may be more likely to not touch their savings or investments in my country people like to see themselves as world champions in savings but if you talk to people you find that many people talk about saving for the next holidays as opposed to saving for retirement also if you get going this way long before you are able to retire you reach a relative level of independence that can give you a much better position in wage negotiations as you do not need to take the first badly paid job that comes along in order to survive but can afford to wait and look and negotiate for a better job   psychologically it also seems to be easier to consistently keep the increase in your spending below the increase of your income than to reduce spending once you overspent there are studies around that find homeowners on average substantially more wealthy than people who keep living in rental i 'm mostly talking germany were renting is normal and does not imply poverty but similar findings have also been described for the us even though someone who 'd take the additional money the homeowner put into their home over the rent and invested in other ways would have yielded more value than the home the difference is largely attributed to the fact that buying and a home enforces low spending and saving and it is found that after some decades of downpayment homeowners often go on to spend less than their socio economic peers who rent the group that is described in this question is one that does not even need the mental help of enforcing the savings in addition if this is not about the fixed million but about reaching a level of wealth that allows you to retire people who have moderate spending habits as adults for decades are typically also much better able to get along with less in retirement than others who did went with a high consumption lifestyle instead e.g. the homeowners again   my estimate is that these effects compound in a way that is much more important than the usual compounding effect of interest and even more if you look at interest vs. inflation i.e. the buying power of your investment for everyday life   note that they also cause the group in question to be more resilient in case of a market crash than the average person with about no savings note that market crashes lead to increased risk of job loss   slightly off topic i do not know enough how difficult saving 50 usd out of 50 usd in pakistan is and thus can not comment whether the savings effort called for in the paper is equivalent higher lower than what you achieve i find that trying to keep to student life i.e. spending that is within the means of a student for the first professional years can help kick starting a nest egg european experience again not sure whether applicable in pakistan

trying to time the market is usually a bad idea people who do this every day for a living have a hard time doing that and i 'm guessing you do n't have that kind of time and knowledge   so that leaves you with your first and third options commonly called lump sum and dollar cost averaging respectively    which one to use depends on where your preferences lie on the risk reward dollar cost averaging dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing in my opinion i do n't like it dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000 do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a trade off but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up which is especially true with an index fund so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

where 's the source for your average net profit    i know you ca n't get rich driving uber but 7 cents a mile is definitely off i drove for lyft and uber for a few months 1.5 years ago and netted around $ 10 yes i am factoring in gas service etc   assuming a 45 mph rate for those 14 miles is approximately 20 minutes for easy math so in one hour under your 7 cents a mile you are saying the average uber drive makes $ 3.00 an hour profit    are you factoring in that drivers us at least can deduct cents per business mile

awesome you are a math guy   very good for you   in theory what you are proposing should work out great as the math works out great   however have you taken a economics or finance coursework   the math that they do in these class will leave a most math guys uncomfortable with the even when one is comfortable with chaos theory personal finance is worse   if it were about math things like reverse mortgages payday lenders and advances on one income tax returns would not exist    the risk derived from the situation you describe is one born out of behavior   sometimes it is beyond control of the person attempting your scheme   suppose one of these happen in my opinion the market is risky enough without borrowing money in order to invest   its one thing to not pay extra principle to a mortgage in order to put that money in play in the market it is another thing to do what you are suggesting   while their may be late fees associated with a mortgage payment a fixed rate mortgage will not change if you late on payment(s on these balance transfer cc schemes they will jack your rate up for any excuse possible   i read an article that the most common way to end up with a credit card was to start out with a 0 balance transfer   one thing that is often overlooked is that the transfer fee paid up the stated rate of the card    in the end get out of consumer debt have an emergency fund then start investing   building a firm financial foundation is the best way to go about it   without one it will be difficult to make headway   with one your net worth will increase faster then you imagined possible

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

lower risk of having to fight to get their money back obviously that 's what credit rating is supposed to predict paying your bills on time and paying off the balance in full every month are different questions they want to know that you will make the minimum payments at least and that you will eventually pay back the loan compare that with subprime and/or loan sharks where the assumption is that being late or defaulting is more common and interest rates are truly obscene in order to make a profit despite that

firstly it is n't so generous   it is a win win but the bank does n't have to mail me a free box of checks with my new account or offer free printing to compete for my business   they already have the infrastructure to send out checks so the actual cost for my bank to mail a check on my behalf is pretty minimal   it might even save them some cost and reduce exposure   all the better if they do n't actually mail a check at all per my bank individuals and most companies you pay using send money will be mailed    a paper check your check is guaranteed to arrive by the delivery date    you choose when you create the payment a select number of companies very large corporations such as telecoms    utilities and cable companies are part of our electronic biller    network and will be paid electronically these payments arrive within    two business days so the answer to your question depend on what kind of bill pay you used   if it was an electronic payment there is n't a realistic possibility the money is n't cashed if your bank did mail a paper check the same rules would apply as if you did it yourself   i suppose it would be up to the bank   when i checked with my bank 's support this was their answer therefore per this answer do personal checks expire us it is really up to your bank whether or not they allow the check to be cashed at a later date   if you feel the check is n't cashed quickly enough you would have to stop payment and contact whoever you were trying to pay and perhaps start again   or ask them to hustle and cash the check before you stop it finally i would bet a dime that your bank does n't pre fund your checks   they are just putting a hold on the equivalent money in your account so you do n't overdraw   that is the real favor they do for you   if you stopped the check your money would be and available edit please read the comment about me losing a dime seems credible

well what you said about money is the reason people say things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them there is plenty of economic reasons to for instance conserve and the environment because deforestation and destruction have negative externalities associated with that have to paid out in the future by who ever suffers from those externalities however there is n't a market for eco bonds or a way to value that effectively which is a real issue for ecological conservation   there are people trying to do what and there is an interesting article this week in the new scientist about such nexus between and economics but while there is clear value somewhere assigning it a price only works if people are willing to buy or invest in it    its quite sad how many of the critics of modern banking do n't really appreciate what they do and what finance does or more commonly confusion arises about what finance even is let alone what it does

a balance transfer is paying one debt instrument with another   while this is typically seen in credit card offers it is n't necessarily confined to credit cards obviously the only reason to do this is refinancing debt to a lower interest rate   you need to watch for loads on the incoming money there may be an upwards of 5 fee   this calculation is materially different than your apr   monthly interest charges can be estimated by taking your apr divided by 12 times your balance   so a 15 apr will have a rough monthly interest charge of 1.25   the 5 balance transfer fee is 4x your normal interest charge   that fee is added to your balance and now you pay interest on the whole amount   you need to ensure the new rate is low enough to actually benefit you after the incoming fee

excellent question for a six year old actually a good question for a 20 year old   one explanation is a bit more complicated your son thinks that after the christmas season the company is worth more for example they might have turned $ 10 million of goods into $ 20 million of cash which increases their assets by $ 10 million and is surely a good thing however that 's not the whole picture before the christmas season we have a company with $ 10 million of goods and the christmas season just ahead while afterwards we have a company with $ 20 million cash and nine months of slow sales ahead   let 's say your son gets $ 10 pocket money every sunday at 11 am five minutes to 11 he has one dollar in his pocket five minutes past 11 he has 11 dollars in his pocket is he richer now not really because every minute he gets a bit closer to his pocket money and five past eleven he is again almost a week away from the next pocket money on the other hand on monday he loses his wallet with $ 10 inside he is now $ 10 poorer or his neighbour unexpectedly offers him to wash his car for $ 10 and he does it he is now $ 10 richer   so if the company got robbed in august with all stock gone no insurance but time to buy new stock for the season they lose $ 10 million the company is worth $ 10 million less and the share price drops if they get robbed just before christmas sales start they do n't make the $ 20 million sales so they are $ 10 million poorer but they are $ 20 million behind where they should be the company is worth $ 20 millions less and the share price drops twice as much on the other hand if there is a totally unexpected craze for a new toy going on from april to june and then it drops down and they make $ 10 million unexpectedly they are worth $ 10 million more expected $ 10 million profit = no increase in share price unexpected $ 10 million profit increase in share price   now the second totally different explanation the share price is not based on the value of the company but on what people are willing to pay say it 's november and i own 100 shares worth $ 10 if everyone knew they are worth $ 20 in january i would hold on to my shares and not sell them for $ 10 it would be very hard to convince me to sell them for $ 19   if you could predict that the shares will be worth $ 20 in january then they would be worth $ 20 now the will not go up or down if something good or bad happens that everyone expects it only goes up or down if something happens unexpectedly

the answer depends on whether the company involved has limited liability most but not all public and listed companies and corporations have this but not all so it is worth checking and understanding what you are getting involved with    the expression limited liability means that the owners shareholders of a company have a liability up to the amount of the face value of the shares they hold which they have not yet paid for the difference is usually minor but basically it means that if you buy $ 10 of shares you have no liability but if the company gives you $ 10 of shares and you pay them in cash or kind $ 5 then you still have a liability of $ 5 if the company fails the debtors can come after you for that liability   an unlimited liability company is a different animal altogether lloyds insurance is probably the most famous example lloyds worked by putting together to underwrite risk if the risk does n't happen the consortium keeps the premiums if it does they cover the loss most of the time they are very profitable but not always for example the which covered asbestos caused the bankruptcies of a great many very wealthy people

your friends are overlooking a couple of problems with house prices and salaries being out of whack home equity is a paper gain unless you realize it by selling the house if you do n't but use the home atm all you 're doing is piling up more debt that 's secured on an asset that has downside risk ask anybody who 's refinanced their house to buy a new boat or suv in in other words you 're remortgaging the chickens before the eggs of course they 're also forgetting that all this debt will have to be paid back at some point and that usually takes income not equity in a certain sense the housing market is a pyramid scheme that requires an influx of new buyers to maintain prices very simply if you ca n't sell your house to buy a bigger one because the first time buyer you 're trying to sell it to ca n't afford the down payment or the payment on the mortgage then you ca n't sell your house to buy a bigger better nicer one and the next person in the chain ca n't sell his hers cue the domino effect house prices are only sustainable if people actually can afford to buy houses and if there 's a massive disconnect between house prices and salaries then house prices will fall eventually it might just take a little longer depending on the amount of creative financing options that will eventually dry up

this is a very good question and is at the core of corporate governance   the ceo is a very powerful figure indeed but always remember that he heads the firm 's management only he is appointed by the board of directors and is accountable to them the board on the other hand is accountable to the firm 's shareholders and creditors the ceo is required to disclose his ownership of the firm as well   ideally you as a shareholder would want the board of directors to be as independent of the management as it is possible u.s. regulations require among other things the board of directors to disclose any material relationship they may have with the firm 's employees ex employees or their families such disclosures can be found in annual filings of a company if the board of directors acts independently of the management then it acts to protect the shareholder 's interests over the firm management 's interest and take seemingly hard decisions like dismissing a ceo when they become necessary to protect the franchise and shareholder wealth

i am not sure whether this hold in all countries but at least in the netherlands my bank allows for investment in funds without charging transaction costs the downside is that these funds charge an annual fee of about 1 but for the amounts you are talking about this definitely sounds more attractive than the alternative as an alternative you could just take care of the transaction costs that way your child can see their funds develop as you put it into different stocks without being distracted by the details of course you feel the pain but i believe the main lesson stands out most this way

i do n't know how taxes work in israel but i imagine it is relatively similar to taxes in the us in the us you need to pay taxes on investment earnings when you sell them or in this case trade them for something of value the amount that would typically would be taxed on would be the difference between how much you paid for the currency and the value of the item you traded it for   in theory there should n't be any difference in trading bitcoins versus dollars or euros reality is that they are rather weird and i do n't know what category they would fall into are they a currency or a collectors item i think this is all rather hypothetical because there is no way for any government to track digital currencies and any taxes paid would be based on the honor system   i am not an account and the preceding was not tax advice

congratulations on earning a great income however you have a lot of debt and very high living expenses this will eat all of your income if you do n't get a hold of it now i have a few recommendations for you   at the beginning of each month write down your income and write down all your expenses for the month include everything rent food utilities entertainment transportation loan payments etc   after you 've made this plan for the month do n't spend any money that 's not in the plan you are allowed to change the plan but you ca n't spend more than your income budgeting software such as ynab will make this easier   you are $ in debt that is a lot a large portion of your monthly budget is loan payments i recommend that you knock those out as fast as possible the interest on these loans makes the debt continue to grow the longer you hold them which means that if you take your time paying these off you 'll be spending much more than $ on your debt minimize that number and get rid of them as fast as possible because you want to get rid of the debt emergency as fast as possible you should reduce your spending as much as you can and pay as much as you can toward the debt pay off that furniture first the interest rate on that free money is going to skyrocket the first time you are late with a payment then attack the student loans stay home and cook your own meals as much as possible you may want to consider moving someplace cheaper   the rent you are paying is not out of line with your income but new york is a very expensive place to live in general   moving might help you reduce your expenses i hope you realize at this point that it was pretty silly of you to borrow $ 4k for a new bedroom set while you were $ in debt you referred to your low interest loans as free money but they really are n't they all need to be paid back ask yourself if you had forced yourself to save up $ 4k before buying the furniture would you still have purchased the furniture or would you have instead bought a used set on craigslist for $ 200 this is the reason that furniture stores offer 0 interest loans they got you to buy something that you could n't afford do n't take the bait again   you did n't mention credit cards so i hope that means that you do n't owe any money on credit cards if you do then you need to start thinking of that as debt and add that to your debt emergency if you do use a credit card commit to only charging what you already have in the bank and paying off the card in full every month ynab can make this easier   $ and $ 90k per year are fairly close to each other when you factor in vacation and holidays that is not including other benefits so any other benefits put the salaried position ahead you said that you have a few more years on your parents health coverage but there is no need to wait until the last minute to get your own coverage health insurance is a huge benefit also in general i would say that salaried positions have better job security this is no guarantee of course anyone can get laid off but as a contractor they could tell you not to come in tomorrow and you 'd be done salaried employees are usually given notice severance pay etc if i were you i would take the salaried position   investing is important but so is eliminating this debt emergency if you take the salaried position one of your new benefits will be a retirement program you can take advantage of that especially if the company is kicking in some money this actually is free money but in my opinion if you treat the debt as an emergency and commit to eliminating it as fast as possible you should minimize your investing at this point if it helps you get out of debt faster after you get out of debt investing should be one of your major goals   now while you are young and have few commitments is the best time to learn to live on a budget and eliminate your debt this will set you up for success in the future

the concept of a social contract is absolute a constitution defines the how of a state the social contract addresses the question why a state even exists and what justifies its existence and i say it again the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others   capitalism is based on the exchange of goods and services based on mutual agreement and respect for each other 's property its driving force is competition   it is an invisible force that has been there since the very beginning every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism   we agree on that you can work because the state ensures your safety and the protection of your rights that 's the social contract again   police courts and military might be on the list of those necessary services however mandatory public healthcare is not   preventing a monopoly is not about wealth redistribution the driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition once you have a monopoly the whole thing turns sideways in that area you need to introduce a few market regulations and a handful of guidelines for competition but redistribution of wealth wo n't stop its formation

your question seems to be on your personal understanding of economics and asking that people present to you an explanation of business transactions that is consistent with your own personal worldview but your premises are flawed so an accurate answer should not accept them the basics of trade is that something is worth more to one person than another a wheat farmer has more wheat that they could possibly eat and so it has no value other than what they can get by selling it while an accountant will starve if they do not have any food and thus is willing to pay what the market demands the two parties can both be better off by having a transaction the other motivation for transactions is that parties may disagree as to what something is worth even if one party will lose from the transaction they may both believe they will profit

government default does n't mean that all us money is immediately worthless   first the bondholders will get stiffed   following that interest rates will shoot up because the us is a bad credit risk at this point and the government will monetize its ongoing expenses i.e. fire up the printing presses if you 're concerned about not having access to your money start pulling out a little extra when you get cash at an atm   build it up over time until you have enough currency to weather through whatever emergency you envision with your bank account

lending is n't profitable when interest rates are this low   consider what 's involved to offer a savings or checking account   the bank must maintain branches with tellers   the bank has to pay rent or buy and pay property taxes and utilities   the bank has to pay salaries   the bank has to maintain cash so as to make change   and pay for insurance against robbery   all of that costs money    at 6 interest a bank can sort of make money   not great money but it takes in more than it has to pay out   at 4 interest which is about where ten year mortgage rates are in canada the bank does n't make enough margin   they are better off selling the loan and closing their branches than offering free checking accounts    an additional problem is that banks tend to make money from overdraft fees   but there 's been a move to limit overdraft fees as they target the most economically vulnerable   so canadian banks tend to charge monthly fees instead   uk banks may also start charging monthly fees if interest rates stay low and other fees get curtailed

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

rule of thumb the earlier you pay down your balance the less interest you will accrue and the faster you will pay off the debt as a whole but lets play with some real numbers here   you cited $ 5000 balance and a $ 750 payment but with various bills and things adding onto the balance over the course of a month now if your purchases and payments add up to the same number you are in a losing game so for the sake of argument i am going to say you are putting $ 500 + interest on the card each month and making a $ 750 payment   we also need an interest rate to work with i am going to use and 30 day months to keep the math a bit easier to follow    you basically have two choices in this scenario you can pay 750 a month on the card then use it to make your $ 500 in purchases other payments over time as you suggest in your question   or you can pay $ 250 and hold back $ 500 to make those other payments directly without running them through the card as has been suggested in some other answers so let us compare the two if i start the cycle at $ 5000 make a $ 250 payment on the first day of the cycle then have no other activity i will have a balance of $ for the month and accrue $ in interest at the close of the cycle   balance going into the next period is now $   carry this out for a year and your balance at the close of the 12th cycle is $ and $ of your payments went to interest by contrast if you pay $ 750 at the start of the month then add $ 100 back every 6 days so that you spend $ 500 over the course of the cycle you will have an average daily balance of $ which results in $ in interest charges being accrued at the end of the month   this gives you a balance of $ going into the next cycle putting you about $ 3 ahead of the previous method   push this pattern out for a year and your ending balance is with going to interest   resulting in a savings of over making the smaller payment and paying cash for your other expenses   if this happens to be a rewards card you also have gained whatever rewards benefit it gives you this demonstrates that by the strict numbers game the scenario you propose should come out a small but measurable distance ahead of making a smaller payment in order to avoid putting things back on the card   so why do so many people advise you to not do this    most of it has to do with psychology and risk   the cash method does not leave any room for you to over spend   you have or locked up the credit card so it ca n’t be used casually and when you run out of cash you ca n’t spend any more   which forces you to pay much closer attention to where your money is going    when you are running things through the credit card you generally do n’t have that hard stop unless you are up against your credit limit and even then most issuers are quite happy to let you go over and charge you extra fees for doing so   so if you have this plan where you are intending to put $ 500 on the card in a month then lose track of something you did early in the month and inadvertently spend $ 800 you are digging yourself deeper into the hole instead of climbing your way out there is also a risk in terms of income loss   in the cash method you no longer have the money to spend and you are forced to make the hard decisions about where to allocate what you do have making you much more likely to cut back on luxury items to preserve the necessities   in the card method it is easy to say eh the card has room i can catch up again later and not realize the mess you are causing yourself until you are in way over your head   i personally have run all my bills through a credit card in the past so that i could have one single payment to make   then i was unemployed for six months and ended up moving before i found a new job   everything in between including the move went on the card   next thing i know i am carrying a balance of $ 15k where i used to always have it paid in full   it took roughly 10 years including several years of working strictly in cash to get that back under control i currently have a card that is carrying a balance and i am running select expenses such as fuel and food through it while i the balance back down   most of my main bills are still paid directly from cash specifically so that i do n’t fall back into the same trap i did before   even so there were several months in the past year where the balance was creeping up instead of down because we were not paying that close of attention to our spending    then my wife lost her job and it forced us to closely evaluate where our money was going   we still run certain things through said card but we are much stricter about it being only those select things and the balance is trending down again   the main reason we are still those expenses that way is because this is a cash back reward card and we will be getting roughly $ 1000 back here in a couple more months

as a tl;dr version of jaganalyst 's excellent answer the buying company does n't need every last share all they need is to get 51 of the voting bloc to agree to the merger and to vote that way at a shareholder meeting or if they can get a 90 in the us they do n't even need a vote usually a buying company 's first option is a friendly merger they approach the board of directors or the direct owners of a private company and make a tender offer to buy the company by purchasing their controlling interest the board if they find the offer attractive enough will agree and usually their support or the outright sale of shares will get the company the 51 they need failing the first option the buying company 's next strategy is to make the same tender offer on the open market this must be a public declaration and there must be time for the market to absorb the news before the company can begin purchasing shares on the open market the goal is to acquire 51 of the total shares in existence not 51 of market cap that 's the number or value of shares offered for public trading you could buy 100 of facebook 's market cap and not be anywhere close to a majority holding zuckerberg himself owns 51 of the company and other vcs still have closely held shares not available for public trading that means that a company that does n't have 51 of its shares on the open market is pretty much un without getting at least some of those private shareholders to cash out but that 's actually pretty rare some of your larger multinationals may have as little as 10 of their equity in the hands of the upper management who would be trying to resist such a takeover at this point the company being bought is probably treating this as a hostile takeover they have options such as however for companies that are at risk of a takeover unless management still controls enough of the company that an public stockholder decision would have to be unanimous the shareholder voting body will often reject efforts to activate these measures because the takeover is often viewed as a good thing for them if the company 's vulnerable that 's usually because it has under performing profits or losses which depresses its stock prices and the buying company will typically make a tender offer well above the current stock value should the buying company succeed in approving the merger any holdouts who did not want the merger to occur and did not sell their stock are squeezed out their shares are forcibly purchased at the tender price or exchanged for equivalent stock in the buying company nobody deals in paper certificates anymore and as of the dissolution of the purchased company 's such certs would be worthless and they either move forward as shareholders in the new company or take their cash and go home

there are many reasons which other answers have already discussed i want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons which is that it avoids double taxation especially on corporate earnings   generally for corporations its earnings are already taxed at around 40 for the us including state income taxes when dividends are distributed out it is taxed again at the individual level the effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain i believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the us for a simplistic example say there is a c corporation with a single owner the company earns $ 1,000,000 before income taxes it pays 400,000 in taxes and has retained earnings of $ 600,000 to get the money out the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself or sell her stake to another person either choice leads to $ 600,000 getting taxed at another or so at the individual level depending on the state if we calculate the effective rate it is above 50 many people invest in stock including mutual funds and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason however the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability

the reason to do a stock split is to get the price of the stock down to an affordable range if your stock costs $ 100,000 per share you are seriously cutting in to the number of people who can afford to buy it i can think of two reasons not to do a stock split the biggest is why bother if your stock is trading at a reasonable price why change anything it takes time and effort which equals money to do a stock split if this serves no purpose you 're just wasting that effort the other reason is that you do n't want to drive your stock price down too low low prices are normally associated with highly speculative start up companies and so can give a wrong impression of your company also low prices make it difficult for the price to reflect small changes if your stock is trading at $ 10.00 a 1/2 of 1 change is 5 cents but if it 's trading at $ 1.50 a 1/2 of 1 change is a fraction of a penny does it go up by that penny or not you 've turned a smooth scale into a series of hurdles

not only is this a marketing gimmick as an article but the principle survey question it cites appears to be pretty stupid i say appears to be rather than is because nowhere can i find the actual wording of the question   compare the following questions   what would make you happier a better boss or a pay raise   what would make you happier exchanging your current boss for the best boss you 've ever had or a 50 increase in pay   in the first case the question apparently asked in the actual survey the is left to interpret the relative sizes of the proposed improvements to their job there 's no reason to believe they 're considering changes of commensurate size and in fact there may be systematic bias toward a more significant envisioned improvement in their boss   frankly i would expect this bias since a person 's attitude toward their boss is often colored by the dictator subject nature of their relationship let 's be honest we are predisposed to dislike people who have authority over us when survey respondents are a better boss they may very well be thinking about a boss who does n't exercise that authority but that 's not a very realistic alternative since such a boss would not be effective from the company 's standpoint   in the second question the has more concrete alternatives to consider their alternative boss is at least now confined by realism this alternative boss had to have at least existed furthermore the pay rise is well specified   finally any survey question on this matter suffers from the cheap talk nature of surveys if actually faced with this choice in the real world would people put their money where their mouth is i would hazard to guess that as long as the pay increase was of a reasonable size more than a few people who indicated better boss would ultimately take pay raise given the actual choice

the primary difference between japan and most other developed nations is who owns their debt   japan 's debt is almost entirely internal   that is it 's actually borrowed from within japan   it 's not owned by china or anyone else   additionally japan owns a fairly substantial proportion of the usa 's debt which provides additional security   it 's a favorite complaint of romney and his friends that american is borrowing from china to finance public spending   a lot of people do n't realize that in fact japan was until very recently america 's biggest source of borrowing   and is still number 2 by a substantial margin   combine this with pretty careful regulation by the bank of japan low bond yields and a much larger economy still with a decent manufacturing base and japan 's situation is n't remotely like greece despite it appearing worse   in a nutshell the japan is the educated university graduate with a reasonable income who like many of us who buy a house that costs many multiples of our annual salary and can afford to service the debt even if it needs to be carefully managed   greece is the homeless one armed drug addict with no prospects that struggles to find a few bucks to spend a night in a   the size of the debt is more or less irrelevant   it 's the ability to pay it that really matters   of course this does n't mean that if circumstances change things could n't go south badly but right now japan is n't in trouble and the 230 vs 130 the reality of the situation

the best advice i can give you is that you need to start on math now*. i made the same mistake as op and did n't realize that going up in finance would require as much math as it does granted i was undergrad finance not marketing like him so maybe it was a little better for me but if you really want to do upper level finance do not on math   it 's easy to fall into the trap doing cal 2 your sophomore year and thinking i wo n't really need this and just doing the minimum to get through it for undergrad that 's true for master 's you 'll need it this happened to me and i suffered a lot because of it your professors in the master 's program will likely give you a crash course in what you need to know but you wo n't have a real understanding of it unless you took and did really well in those math classes beforehand   to answer your question    1 maybe you should definitely take cal 1 early depending on how you can hold on to the information cal 2 can wait a bit so it 's fresher when you start doing upper level finance your second half of junior year senior year   2 upper level finance is a whole different beast from lower level finance same with economics if you 're not good at math if you do n't enjoy math it might not be the best choice i 'm not good at math and the undergrad finance was n't too bad however the master 's program was very very not fun    edit ymmv but i do n't recommend going straight into the master 's program straight out of undergrad work in industry for a bit first the jobs you need to a master 's for wo n't hire you straight out of undergrad so it 'll be dead weight experience is what you need

i thought i 'd see if the credit card companies had anything to say about this while trying to get merchants to sign up i went to clicked run your business in the top nav then accept visa payments this page has a more benefits of accepting visa link with an which i ca n't easily link directly to which includes these lines while the average cash transaction is $ 17 credit card purchases average $ 70 while debit card purchases average $ visa payment panel study to time period visa mars data march 2015 may 2015   that obviously does n't tell the entire story i suspect people are more likely to pull out cash when they 're just buying a stick of gum and more more likely to pull out a card when they 're buying large electronics but certainly there is some evidence from the credit card companies themselves that people spend more when using cards which is one of the aspects they use to convince merchants to accept cards i think the best evidence that people spend more is that more and more merchants accept cards accepting cards comes with some significant costs though it 's important to keep in mind that accepting cash can come with some significant costs as well i suspect that merchants would n't do so unless the increased sales that they get for accepting cards makes up for the fees that they need to pay and the equipment they need to buy to accept them not to mention the risks of chargebacks and the like

depending on jurisdiction the fact that you made some payments might give you an ownership share in the house in your own right what share would be a complex question because you might need to consider both the mortgage payments made and maintenance your sister might also be able to argue that she was entitled to some for the risk she describes of co signing and that 's something that would be very hard to quantify but clearly you would also be entitled to similar in respect of that as you also co signed for the share your mother owned the normal rules of inheritance apply and by default that would be a 50 50 split as joetaxpayer said you imply that the loan is still outstanding so all of this only applies to the equity previously built up in the house prior to your mother 's death if you are the only one making the ongoing payments i would expect any further equity built up to belong solely to you but again the jurisdiction and the fact that your sister 's name is on the deeds could affect this if you ca n't resolve this you might need to get a court involved and it 's possible that the cost of doing so would outweigh the eventual benefit to you

the tax cost at election should be zero   the appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis which will be the value at election irc 83 applies to property received as compensation for services where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture   it will catch unvested equity given to employees stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture i.e. no tax until stock vests since the item is and not yet truly income   83(b allows the taxpayer to make a quick election up to 30 days after transfer firm deadline to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture e.g. treat shares as vested today the normal operation of 83 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it   if you paid fair market value today then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero the shares are now yours for tax purposes though not for legal purposes   that means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands like other stocks you own or trade   the shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares if you sell them you get capital gain with tax dependent on your holding period over a basis equal to fmv at the election   the appreciation past election fmv will be capital gain rather than ordinary income   this is why the 83(b election is so valuable   it does not matter at this point whether you bought the restricted shares at fmv or at discount or received them free that only affects the taxes upon 83(b election

it varies depending on your brokerage they may charge you per transaction so the more transactions the higher the cost though this from what i 've seen is uncommon with many index funds in terms of how aggressive you want to be with your investment varies on your comfort with risk timeline of investment and many other factors beyond the scope of this question   the biggest issue you may need to be aware of is if you are looking at mutual funds they may have minimum investments depending on what that minimum investment is set to you may not be able to split your $ 5500 into more than one fund   a lot of this comes down to the specific funds in which your are anticipating investing as well as the service you use to do so fidelity vanguard etc ultimately diversification can be a lot safer but there are logistics to consider personally i began with a target fund a mutual fund with adjusted risk based on the estimated year of retirement and add additional mutual funds stocks and etfs as time goes on

there is almost no reason to get a second credit card this is a very good arrangement for your creditor but not for you credit cards have high rates of interest which you have to pay unless you pay the credit off every month therefore increasing your total credit capacity should not be your concern   since internet technology lets you pay off your balance in minutes online there is no reason to have multiple cards in order to avoid running out of a balance if on the other hand you do not pay your existing card off every month than getting another card can be even more dangerous since you 're increasing the amount of debt you take on i 'd say at most it would make sense for you to grab a basic visa since most places do not accept amex i would also considering cancelling the amex if you get the visa for reasons above

can you elaborate more on what you are referring too no where near an economic expert but by demand side subsidization are you referring to the fed gov giving people money for their health care costs excluding the erroneous spending such as a patient only willing to take a brand name pharmaceutical drug instead of a generic that health care will be needed regardless correct so if taxes fit the bill why would costs for the care received go up is it just because the provider knows they 'll get the $ $ almost no matter what if it 's gov $ $ or something else besides to put it bluntly greed that would directly increase those costs   serious question btw

what eu wanted to force cyprus to do is to break the insurance contract the government has with the bank depositors the parliament rightfully refused and it did n't pass in the eu and cyprus as part of it all bank deposits are insured up to by the government this is similar to the us fdic insurance thus requiring the small up to 100 k depositors to participate in the bank reorganization means that the government breaks its word to people and effectively defaults that is exactly what the cyprus government wanted to avoid the default so i ca n't understand why the idea even came up depositors of more than 100k are not guaranteed against bank failures and indeed in cyprus these depositors will get haircuts but before them first come shareholders and bondholders who would be completely wiped out thus first and foremost those who failed the bank owners will be the first to pay the price however governments can default this happened in many places for example in russia in the 90 's in argentina in 2000 's and in fact numerous times during the last century the us in the 1930 's and many other examples you can see a list in wikipedia when government defaults on its debts it will not pay some or all of them and its currency may also be for example in russia in 1998 the currency lost 70 of its value against the usd within months and much of the cash at hands of the public became worthless overnight in the us in 1933 the president issued an executive order private citizens keeping gold and silver and coins which resulted in dollar devaluation by about 30 and investors in precious metals losing large amounts of money the executive order requiring surrender of the treasury gold certificates is in fact the government 's failure to pay on these obligations while the us or russia control their own currency european countries do n't and can not the currency as they wish in order to ease their debts thus in euro zone the devaluation solutions taken by russia and the us are not possible cyprus can not its currency and even if it could its external debt would not likely to be denominated in it actually russian debt is n't denominated in rubles that 's why they forced restructuring of their own debt but the currency helped raising the money from the citizens similarly to the us seizing the gold in 1930 's thus in case of cyprus or other euro zone countries direct taxes is the only way to raise money from the citizens so if you 're in a country that controls its own currency such as the us russia argentina etc and especially if the debt is denominated in that currency mainly the us you should be worried more of inflation than taxes but if you 're in the euro zone and your country is in troubles which is almost any country in the zone you can expect taxes how to avoid that deal with your elected officials and have them fix your economy but know that you ca n't just erase the debt through inflation as the americans can and will someone will have to pay

i 'm having a difficult time understanding how chevron is avoiding taxes through party related loans from my understanding chevron is providing loans to its australian subsidiary at interest rates higher than market benchmarks does this shift profits from australia to the u.s. and how does it help chevron avoid taxes even though the corporate tax rate is higher in the u.s. than in australia they want to be taxed at the the lower tax rate in australia than in the u.s. the more description the better thanks edit i think i understand that chevron is giving out large loans with high interest rates to its subsidiary in australia and i think the australian subsidiary is converting its revenues to pay back the loan thus looking like profit in the corporation 's books in delaware how is the money to pay back interest being raised if not from revenue and how is that revenue not being taxed

i 've been told by staff in my local car hire agency that they get such big discounts that they actually make money selling the cars so they replace all their cars every six months in the uk the number plate indicates when the car was registered in six month periods this suits the manufacturers because it means they can offer a lower cost product to price sensitive customers while charging more to people who want something brand new for example you could buy a brand new fiesta for £ 14,000 or a 6 month old version of the same car with a few thousand miles on the clock for £ 12,000 this means if you only have £ 12,000 then you can afford to buy a nearly new fiesta but if you can afford a bit more then ford will happily take that off you for a brand new fiesta ford sell an extra car and if the car hire company only paid £ 11,000 then they make some profit too

i believe you may be missing the point here it they do n't really verify this that before bofa took over the loan the homeowners were not using an escrow account i know this is possible because i had the option of using one or not when i bought my house so it seems that once bofa took over they automatically created an escrow account and when the normal payments the homeowners were making did n't cover the total monthly balance they took it out of the payment specifically for the mortgage    so according to this story its not sensational bullshit this would be the bank creating an issue that is according to the facts that are presented in the article which may not be the whole story   spelling amp grammar

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

no absolutely not   income tax rates are marginal   the tax bracket 's higher tax rate only applies to extra dollars over the threshold not to dollars below it   the normal income tax does not have any where one extra dollar of income will cost more than one dollar in extra taxes moreover you are ignoring the personal exemption and standard deduction   a gross salary of $ 72,000 is not the same as taxable income of $ 72,000   the deduction will generally be $ and the exemptions will be $ 3,900 for you your spouse and any kids   so married filing jointly with the standard deduction will get an automatic $ 20,000 off of adjusted gross income when counting taxable income   so the appropriate taxable income is actually going to be more like $ note that getting your compensation package may result in different tax treatment   but simply taking a smaller salary rather than taking some compensation as stock options health insurance or fringe benefits is not a money saving move   never do it

interesting the answer can be as convoluted complex as one wishes to make it or back of envelope   my claim is that if one starts at 21 and deposits 10 of their income each year they will likely hit a good retirement nest egg at an 8 return each year keep in mind the last 40 years produced 10 even with the lost decade the 10 saver has just over their final income as a retirement account at 4 withdrawal this replaces 60 of their income with social security the rest to get to nearly 100 or so replacement note i wrote an article about social security benefits showing the benefit as a percent of final income at $ 50 k it 's 42 it 's a higher replacement rate for lower income but the replacement rate drops as income rises so the $ 5000 question for an individual earning $ 50 k or less this amount is enough to fund their retirement for those earning more it will be one of the components but not the full savings needed   by the way a single person has a standard deduction and exemption totaling $ in 2014 i refer to this as the zero bracket the next $ is taxed at 10 why go 100 roth and miss the opportunity to fund these low or no tax withdrawals

gt that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3   health care costs have actually been on the rise for decades now it was only noticed by the majority party i.e. the gop who had held the majority for 16 of the years prior to 2009 when the aca was enacted suddenly health care costs started to explode the truth is that health care costs have been on a steady rise in the time period from 1972 to 1982 costs rose on average 14 per causes of rising healthcare keep in mind this was prior to the expansion of medicare from 1983 1992 costs grew at a rate of 9 per year 3 times faster than inflation from 1993 to 2010 cost rose at a rate of 6.4 per year the aca of course was passed in 2009 but did n't start to take effect until 2011 since 2010 health care costs has risen about 4 per year that is a 2 drop in a short amount of time compared to the previous years however the numbers are already so big just like the national debt that the gop who had as much part to play in the health care costs as they did in the debt had tons of numbers they could use to make it seem like health care costs have exploded    in reality what happened is that people who never had health insurance before were forced to get it and started to realize how expensive it is when it actually covers what it was intended to cover preventative care as well as emergent care the gop has been on a steady march to undermine the new law as much as possible since it passed because it made some of their biggest donors and health care insurance providers uncomfortable the fact that they had to share their cost information and that the health care exchange required them to do a line item by line item comparison with other companies out there    so here we are the aca is going to be cut and millions of people are going back to be uninsured or what you are going to see is the rate of costs growth start to increase again after decades of slowly decreasing rates why because of the renewed ability of insurance providers to hide the costs to hide costs increases it will also cause hospitals to greatly overcharge the uninsured as they were doing before but there will be many more of them the goal being that the uninsured are unlikely to pay for the very large medical bills so knowing this hospitals artificially inflate the bill in the hopes of getting a larger portion of that unpaid bill liquidated through medicare    uninsured populations also lead to more unhealthy people you would think that not having health insurance would make people want to remain more healthy however studies show the opposite to be articles business in actuality people stress more about their health and avoid periodic checkups both of which lead to bad health results    trying to blame the cost increases in health care on government meddling or say it is a problem brought on by the aca is weird since there are so many examples of government sites s healthcare ranked dead last compared health care programs out there which are so much more efficient less costly and have resulted in much healthier populations    gt i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that    i am going to call bs number one that is a huge claim to make without supporting evidence number two you would have to demonstrate how much that same visit would cost to those with health insurance    gt do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections    actually no the exact opposite they now because you are uninsured that you are unlikely to pay so they overcharge you for the same services because they know that they will only be reimbursed a percentage of the costs if it goes to medicare for non payment    gt the swiss do everything better   you keep referring back to switzerland do n't get me wrong they are a very good country and have the number 2 ranked health care system in the world however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are they have an average corporate tax rate of wiki whereas the us has it at 32 their highest income tax bracket is whereas the us is at 39 their sales tax goes at high as 8 where ours go as high as 11 their average effective rate is around 11 while ours is around 18 including social security puts switzerland at 17 and the us at 24    so they are definitely a lower tax rate country but in no way are they a no tax rate country then again switzerland has no military to speak of while the us spends more on military then the next 7 countries put together    gt this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time    i have been very patient i have stuck with this conversation in spite of the put downs and remarks i have a little too but you can go back to most of my remarks and see that i have been more i have given you some leeway because of your age and i am almost twice as old as you    so you gave me your background i will give you mine i am closer to 50 then i would prefer i left the house at 17 enlisted in the navy and spent the next 15 years serving in the military i ended my career in a select community i have been out for ten years this july i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences i have seen the best and worst of government as well as seen the same on the commercial side of the house anyone comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true anyone comes thinking that commercial equals efficient learns that is not always true too    gt take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft   as i said previously that you thought was a dumb comment commercial is very good at taking existing systems and finding ways to make them efficient and better apple and microsoft is the same they both made their mark in history by expanding on and creating innovation with existing technologies that had their foundation in government r&amp;d projects including the digital wiki as well as computers like the and the issues and the advancements into tech ibm invent the personal computer answer which lead to the first efficient and cost effective personal computers the touchscreen was actually first invented in by engineers at wiki and of course we know that the internet started as a government funded project called news ask history who invented the internet    i think you would be surprised how much many if not most of the things we take for granted today have a foundation in government funded r&amp;d. my company is a commercial company and we do a great job creating our own products and innovation and yet still our best selling product is a design of a national laboratory that we license from them commercial industry is great at manufacturing and producing something the government is not as good at and so often they will license out designs for production to companies like ours some of the biggest commercial companies out there do the same

essentially your question is lump sum vs dca and your tags reflect that in the long run lump sum say a jan 2 deposit each year will beat dca by about 1/2 the average annual market return $ 12,000 will see a 10 return vs $ 1,000/month over the year seeing 6 what hurts is when the market tanks in the first half of the year and you think dca would have helped this is a feeling issue not a math problem   but by the time you have $ 100 k invested the difference of dca vs lump sum with new money fades as new deposits are small compared to the funds invested   by then you need to know your target allocation and deposit to keep that allocation with new money

it works if after the price has halved and you buy more the price then rises however if you are attempting to do this you are basing you doubling down on hope and if you are basing a purchase on hope you are gambling in many cases if the price has halved it could be because there is something very wrong with the company so the price could half again in that case it has n't worked you are better off waiting to see if the company makes a turn around and starts improving wait for confirmation that the stock price is heading back up before buying

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

no but it is certainly a possibility the efficient market hypothesis would say that this means that the market perceives the present value of all future earning as negative these earnings might take the form of a of assets at some point companies carry a goodwill asset that is generally imaginary   they book that asset when they buy companies for more than they are worth it would be as if was a stock tracking my life   if i bought my house in 2006 for $ 1 million cash i might have a book value of $ 1 million   however might trade at $ 500k because the market knows that my asset is n't really worth $ 1 million and at some point my earnings will take a hit to reflect that it might also mean that future real earnings ie actual profit and loss on sales are going to be negative this would mean bankruptcy is more likely

there are mutual funds oriented toward kids or that are suitable in some way e.g. they have low minimums here are two articles with mention of some of them of those only usaa first start growth is explicitly for kids or another fund aimed at kids is young investor or the diversified funds with fixed income like usaa first start growth vanguard star world balanced etc have the nice property that they wo n't be as volatile and may spend less time underwater so that might better convey the value of investing vs. an all stock fund where it could be kind of depressing for years on end if you get bad luck though i feel the same principle applies for adults kids may appreciate intangible aspects of the funds e.g. world balanced invests in sustainable companies appreciation also has some social parameters and i think the guy running it does charity work with kids that type of thing there should be quarterly and annual reports on mutual funds or stocks that would give kids something to read and think about related to the investment disclaimer none of these funds are recommendations i have not researched them in any detail just giving you some leads

if you place your emergency fund in your tfsa you can withdraw it at any time e.g. in an emergency and then replace the withdrawn money in the next calendar year be careful there you pay a hefty fine if you replace it in the current calendar year if this leads to an overcontribution it 's not an either or thing though you could invest the money in a mutual fund inside your tfsa i strongly recommend against this for your emergency fund however the whole point of an emergency fund is that you may need it immediately so keep it in an investment that you can liquidate quickly cash or very near cash while i obviously do n't know your specific situation i needed $ 10,000 within 24 hours and another $ 10,000 within two weeks during an emergency in a world where you have large sums of money you 'd max out your rrsp and tfsa with investments and keep your emergency fund outside of both but most of us are n't in that situation in that case it makes sense to use your tfsa for your emergency fund i use some of my tfsa space for my emergency fund savings account paying low interest though people often like gics and some for investment passive indexed stocks and bonds note that you need to pay taxes on your savings account interest too if held outside your tfsa and rrsp accounts

a couple of thoughts tax benefits are the usual reasons to decide on one residency or another international tax law is complex and it 's probably best to consult a professional certainly without knowing which the other country is i would not want to hazard a guess if he is really not going to be taxed on the other country residing there would seem sensible but in canada residency for tax purposes is established for an entire year if you are resident for more than six months your salary for the year is taxable conversely if you are present for less than six months you are not taxable this may have changed it 's been twenty years since i did this the other issue is healthcare if you are not resident in ontario you are not eligible for free healthcare i believe he might have to purchase supplemental insurance if he returns occasionally

the new payment on $ 3.5 15yr would be $ compared to $ now 26 bi weekly payments but 12 months assuming the difference is nearly all interest the savings is closer to $ than   note actual savings are different the actual savings is based on the difference in interest over the year since the term will be changing i 'm looking at cash flow which is the larger concern in my opinion     $ is 60 months this is your break even time to payoff the $ higher actually since the $ 17 k will be accruing interest   i did n't see any mention of closing costs or other expenses obviously that has to be factored in as well   i think the trade off is n't worth it as the other answers suggest the rental is too close to break even now the cost of repairs on two houses is an issue in my opinion it 's less about the expenses being huge than being random you do n't get billed $ to paint the house you wake up see too many spots showing wear and get a $ 3000 bill same for all high cost items roof hvac etc   you are permitted to borrow 50 of your 401(k balance so you have $ 64 k in the account i do n't know your age this might be great or a bit low i 'd keep saving not putting any extra toward either mortgage until i had an emergency fund that was more than sufficient the fund needs to handle the unexpected expenses as well as the months of unemployment in general 6 9 months of these expenses is recommended   to be clear there are times a 401(k loan can make sense i just do n't see that it does now   disclaimer when analyzing there are two approaches the first is to look at interest saved after all interest is the expense principal payments go right to your balance sheet the second is purely cash flow in which case one might justify a higher rate and going from 15 to 30 years but freeing up cash that can be better deployed even though the rate goes up say 1/2 the payment drops due to the term take that savings and deposit to a matched 401(k and the numbers may work out very well   i offer this to explain why the math above may not be consistent with other answers of mine

the primary tax sheltered investing vehicles in canada include the rrsp you can contribute up to 18 of your prior year 's earned income up to a limit $ in 2015 plus past unused contribution allowance and receive an income tax deduction for your contributions in an rrsp investments grow on a tax deferred basis no tax is due until you begin withdrawals when you withdraw funds the withdrawn amount will be taxed at marginal income tax rates in effect at that time the rrsp is similar to the u.s. traditional ira being an individual account with pre tax contributions tax deferred growth and ordinary tax rates applied to withdrawals yet rrsps have contribution limits higher than iras higher even than u.s. 401(k employee contribution limits but the rrsp is dissimilar to the ira and 401(k since an individual 's annual contribution allowance is n't use it or lose it unused allowance accumulates the tfsa once you turn 18 you can put in up to $ 5,500 each year irrespective of earned income like the rrsp contribution room accumulates if you were 18 in 2009 when tfsas were introduced you 'd be able to contribute $ if you 'd never contributed to one before unlike the rrsp contributions to a tfsa are made on an after tax basis and you pay no tax when you withdraw money the post tax nature of the tfsa and completely tax free withdrawals makes them comparable to roth type accounts in the u.s. i.e. while you wo n't get a tax deduction for contributing you wo n't pay tax on earnings when withdrawn yet unlike u.s. roth type accounts you are not required to use the tfsa strictly for retirement savings there is no penalty for pre retirement withdrawal of tfsa funds there are also employer sponsored defined benefit db and defined contribution dc retirement pension plans generally employees who participate in these kinds of plans have their annual rrsp contribution limits reduced i wo n't comment on these kinds of plans other than to say they exist and if your employer has one check it out many employees lose out on free money by not participating the under appreciated resp typically used for education savings a lifetime $ 50,000 contribution limit per beneficiary and you can put that all in at once if you 're not concerned about maximizing grants see below no tax deduction for contributions but investments grow on a tax deferred basis original contributions can be withdrawn tax free qualified educational withdrawals of earnings are taxed as regular income in the hands of the beneficiary an resp beneficiary is typically a child and in a child 's case the canadian federal government provides matching grant money called cesg of 20 on the first $ 2500 contributed each year up to age 18 to a lifetime maximum of $ 7200 per beneficiary grant money is subject to additional conditions for withdrawal while resps are typically used to save for a child 's future education there 's nothing stopping an adult from opening an resp for himself if you 've never had one you can deposit $ 50,000 of after tax money to grow on a tax deferred basis for up to 36 years as far as i understand an adult resp will not qualify for cesg moreover if you use the resp strictly as a tax shelter and do n't make qualified educational withdrawals when the time comes your original contributions still come out free of tax but you 'll pay ordinary income tax plus 20 additional tax on the earnings portion that 's the however if at that time you have accumulated sufficient rrsp contribution room you may move up to $ 50,000 of your resp earnings into your rrsp without any tax consequences i.e. also avoiding the 20 additional tax at time of transfer perhaps there 's something above you have n't considered still be sure to do your own due diligence and to consult a qualified experienced and conflict free financial advisor for advice particular to your own situation

you are correct that are very confusing for multiple income homes and even more so if you change salary significantly during the year   there are just too many variables in those situations to provide an effective simple form unfortunately the best way to get accurate withholdings is trial and error   try and estimate how much tax you 'll have to pay for the year   there are several calculators out there but essentially you can take your gross income subtract the standard exemptions for you and all dependents subtract the standard deductions or estimate your itemized deductions and compute your tax based on the federal tax tables   then subtract any tax credits you may be eligible for then estimate your withholdings for the year by multiplying your current withholdings by the number of pay periods left and adding your ytd withholdings   if your total withholdings are higher than your estimated tax add one or two exemptions to reduce your withholdings and vice versa    if all that sounds like a lot of work which it is at a minimum make sure you withhold as much tax as you paid last year   that way you avoid any tax penalties but might have a tax bill when you file   if you want to be conservative and withhold a little extra that 's fine you might even end up with a refund when you file   the good news is it does n't have to be exact any difference will determine what you pay or what refund you get when you file

i just wanted to point out that the most leverage for pre paying occurs at the very beginning of the mortgage and declines rapidly after that so your very best scenario is to get the 30-year and make one extra payment entirely to principal the first month of every year this causes the amortization to drop by 96 payments to about 22 years i do n't know of any other way that you can get nearly 4 times value for your money 22 payments extra to save 96 payments later after that reducing from 22 to 15 years takes more of your money for the same result but do it if you want i actually did this and it put me way ahead when i sold the house about 12 years later

espp tax treatment is complicated   if you received a discount on the purchase of your stock that discount is taxable as ordinary income when you sell the stock   any profit about the market value when the stock was purchased is taxed based upon the holding period of the stock if you have held the stock less than a year the profit is taxed at your marginal tax rate ie taxed as ordinary income if the stock is held for more than a year it is taxed at a special capital gains tax rate which ranges from 0 20 depending on your marginal tax rate most people pay 15

payroll is a huge part of these companies costs the notion that payroll could be doubled or tripled and prices would only rise a few cents is wild hyperbole fit for /r politics not /r business we expect better than here   but regardless it 's not about damage to the consumer via higher prices in my   opinion the fact that something costs the consumer more is almost totally irrelevant to this discussion    the point is that businesses that operate by employing teens and college students are under no obligation to raise their wages just because the broader economy is crap and adults are filtering into the positions

can it be so that these low interest rates cause investors to take greater risk to get a decent return   with interest rates being as low as they are there is little to no risk in banking especially after dodd frank risk is just a fancy word for will i make money in the long future no one knows what the actual risk is unless you can see into the future but there are ways to mitigate it so arguably the best way to make money is the stock market not in banking   there is a great misallocation of resources which at some point will show itself and cause tremendous losses even maybe cause a new financial crisis a financial crisis is backed on a believed to be strong investment that goes belly up   tremendous losses is a rather grand term with no merit banks are not purposely keeping interest rates low to cause a financial crisis   as the central banks have kept interest rates extremely low for a decade even negative this affects how much we save and borrow the biggest point here is to know one thing bonds bonds affect all things from municipalities construction to pensions if interest rates increased currently the current rate of bonds would drop vastly and actually cause a financial crisis in the u.s. due to millions of older persons relying on bonds as sources of income

note that these used to be a single common share that has split actually a special dividend but effectively a split if you owned one share of google before the split you had one share giving you x worth of equity in the company and 1 vote after the split you have two shares giving you the same x worth of equity and 1 vote in other words zero change buy or sell either depending on how much you value the vote and how much you think others will pay or not for that vote in the future   as google issues new shares it 'll likely issue more of the new non voting shares meaning dilution of equity but not dilution of voting power for most of us our few votes count for nothing so evaluate this as you will   google 's founders believe they can do a better job running the company long term when there are fewer pressures from outside holders who may have only short term interests in mind if you disagree or if you are only interested in the short term you probably should n't be an owner of google as always evaluate the facts for yourself your situation and your beliefs

what fact   gt;it 's true that some americans do n't pay federal income tax but virtually all americans pay some form of tax whether it 's sales payroll state income or property tax    60 of those who do n't pay income tax are working they pay payroll tax which goes to support social security and medicare another 22 of those who do n't pay income tax are the elderly most of them do n't work    gt;in fact only about 8 of americans pay neither federal income tax nor payroll tax because they are unemployed are students or are disabled    gt;what is missing from all this talk about tax is the fact that although the rich pay higher taxes than the poor middle class people actually pay a higher percentage of their income in total taxes true federal income tax rates are progressive with rates going to 35 for the top earners but deductions and special treatment of capital gains reduce actual tax rates for the top earners so what we end up with is upper middle class taxpayers paying the highest actual percentage of their income over 31 according to a 2010 study by the group citizens for tax justice

in regards to the legal recourse no there is none   also despite your with citi it may not be their fault   mortgage companies are now forced to select appraisers essentially at random through 3rd party appraisal resource companies   this mandate from the government was issued in order to combat fraud but it is really causing more trouble for homeowners because it took away appraiser accountability   basically there 's nothing we can do to fire an appraiser anymore   i 've had appraiser do terrible jobs just blatantly wrong and have gone the distance with the dispute process only to find they wo n't change the value   my favorite real life example came from an appraiser who got the bedroom count wrong 4 instead of 5 yet he took pictures of 5 bedrooms   the one he excluded he stated it should n't count because it did n't have a closet   problem is it did have a closet   i had the homeowner take pictures of all of the in his house and send them in   he still refused to change the count   after close to 2 months of the dispute process the arc came in and changed the count but did not the value stating that the room count did n't increase the sqft and there would be no adjustment in value   i was   the only solution we had was to wait for the appraisal to expire then order it again which we did   the new appraiser got the count right and surprisingly not really it came in at the right value in regards to the value necessary to avoid mi they are likely using 80 but it 's not based on your current balance vs the value it 's based on the new loan amount which will include costs skipped mortgage payments etc vs the value here are your options get a new appraisal   if you are confident the value is wrong go somewhere else and get a new appraisal restructure the loan   any competent loan officer would have noticed that you are very close to 80 and should have offer you the option of splitting the mortgage into a 1st and 2nd loan   keeping the first loan at 80 and taking out a 2nd for the difference would avoid mi best regards newton

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

in general i 'd try to keep things as simple as possible if your plan is to have a three fund portfolio like total market total international and bond and keep those three funds in general then having it separated now and adding them all as you invest more is fine and upgrade to admiral shares once you hit the threshold for it likewise just putting it all into total market as suggested in another answer or into something like a target retirement fund is just fine too for that amount while i 'm all in favor of as low expense ratios as possible and it 's the kind of question i might have worried about myself not that long ago look at the actual dollar amount here you 're comparing 0.04 to 0.14 on $ 10,000 that 0.1 difference is $ 10 per year any amount of market fluctuation or buying on an up day or selling on a down day is going to pretty much dwarf that amount by the time that difference in expense ratios actually amounts to something that 's worth worrying about you should have enough to get admiral shares in all or at least most of your funds in the long run the amount you manage to invest and your asset allocation is worth much much more than a 0.1 expense ratio difference now if you 're going to talk about some crazy investment with a 2 expense ratio or something that 's another story but it 's hard to go wrong at vanguard in that respect

well to start with i would make sure that the interest total you are collecting each month is greater than the interest total you are paying each month on your credit card debt   so if you have $ 200 a month in interest you pay the credit card company i would make sure that the interest you collect on the loan is more than $ 200 a month   and make sure that you use some portion of the principle payment to pay down the credit card debt so that you are still even or ahead of the interest you owe the credit card company beyond that i would want the rate to be higher than the borrower could expect from a bank   this will incentivize the borrower to either pay it off early or refinance the loan through a bank effectively paying it off early for you   anything that shifts the risk off of you and onto someone else is in your favor here you could also implement some sort of final payment fee and reduce this fee by a certain amount presumably up to 100 if it is paid off early   i would graduate that amount so there is still incentive if the buyer misses the original date but still incentive to meet the date   if the loan was for 10 years then i would probably do around .5 per year early    i would also get an attorney to draw up the loan paperwork to make sure that potentially your heirs are covered should you need to recover from a default bankruptcy or other potential problems   i would bet the lawyer fees will save you the amount if only in headaches   and if you are dealing with family the lawyer makes a great fall guy to say i wish i could do that but the lawyer wo n't let me if the family member tries to take advantage

congratulations on getting married   as far as the irs is concerned you are a married couple for all of this year for tax purposes the 2014 hsa contribution limit for you and your husband together is $   this limit applies to both of you together whether you file jointly or separately   so it looks like you and your husband have excess contributions this year   you 'll need to withdraw some contributions either in your account or your husband 's account to get under $ total for the year if you choose to take this money out of your account since you have already spent this money out of your hsa you wo n't actually receive a check from the withdrawal   instead the money that you have already spent will be from a normal hsa medical distribution to an excess contribution withdrawal   when you get your 1099-sa form from your hsa bank at tax time the distributions will be coded as excess contributions distributions   in addition the form will include the amount of any earnings interest that you received on your excess contributions at tax time you 'll need to examine your w-2 form from your employer closely   if the form does not include the amount that the employer hsa contribution in your taxable income you 'll need to add this amount as other income on your taxes   you 'll also need to include any earnings on the excess contributions reported on the 1099-sa since your husband funds his own hsa and does n't have any employer contributions to it you might find it easier to withdraw the excess contributions from his hsa instead of yours   to do this you need to tell his hsa bank that the withdrawal is an excess contribution withdrawal so that it gets reported correctly on his 1099-sa   there wo n't be any changes to his w-2 and the only other income he 'll need to report is any earnings on the excess contributions from his 1099-sa the instructions for form 8889 line 13 explain what to do in the event of an excess contribution note the text here is from the 2013 version of the instructions line 13 if you or someone on your behalf or your employer contributed more to your hsa than is allowable you may have to pay an additional tax on the excess contributions figure the excess contributions using the following instructions see form 5329 additional taxes on qualified plans including iras and other tax favored accounts to figure the additional tax excess contributions you make to figure your excess contributions including those made on your behalf subtract your deductible contributions line 13 from your actual contributions line 2 however you can withdraw some or all of your excess contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the note under excess employer contributions later you do not claim a deduction for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings excess employer contributions excess employer contributions are the excess if any of your employer 's contributions over your limitation on line 8 if you made a qualified hsa funding distribution line 10 during the tax year reduce your limitation line 8) by that distribution before you determine whether you have excess employer contributions if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return however you can withdraw some or all of the excess employer contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the following note you do not claim an exclusion from income for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings there are further instructions on what to do if you do n't take care of this until a future year but it is much better and easier if you take care of this before the end of this year and handle it correctly on your tax return i believe that this is how it will all work however you 'll want to confirm all of this with someone who knows what they are talking about and can look at your individual situation   hopefully this answer gives you enough information to be able to ask the right questions

for reporting purposes most ira firms prefer that you roll the 401(k funds into a rollover or traditional ira and then convert to the roth from there the mid air conversions 401(k directly into a roth can get tricky when you go to do your taxes the following year if the 1099 form from the releasing custodian and the 5498 form from the accepting custodian have different numbers due to the conversion amount and taxes withheld if any

i know it 's popular to hate on amazon but look by offering lower priced product both and ebooks they allow more people greater access to books yes smaller local bookstores and find it difficult if not impossible to compete with their prices but customers vote with their dollars or euros they prefer cheaper books to cute bookstore cafes   amazon has led to more people reading more books and it 's a to emerging writers who are no longer held in to the major gatekeepers of the publishing industry hating on amazon because it 's corporate is pointless unless you heap equal amounts of criticism against the big publishers who pick and choose who to publish and inflate prices on books

this is not really the focus of your question but it 's worth noting that if you live in the united states which your profile says you do there are tax implications for you but not for your children depending on whether or not you charge your children enough interest   if you charge less interest than the appropriate applicable federal rate for may 2016 at least you must pay taxes on the interest payments you would have received from the debtor if you had charged the provided that the loan is for $ or more p. 7 this is referred to as imputed income

the amount you contribute will reduce the taxable income for each paycheck but it wo n't impact the level of your social security and medicare taxes a 401(k plan is a qualified deferred compensation plan in which an    employee can elect to have the employer contribute a portion of his or    her cash wages to the plan on a pretax basis generally these    deferred wages commonly referred to as elective contributions are    not subject to income tax withholding at the time of deferral and    they are not reflected on your form 1040 pdf since they were not    included in the taxable wages on your form w-2 pdf however they    are included as wages subject to withholding for social security and    medicare taxes in addition employers must report the elective    contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes you might be able to keep this up for more than 7 weeks if the company offers health dental and vision insurance your contributions for these policies would need to be paid for before you contribute to the 401k. of course these items are also pre tax so they will keep the taxable amount at zero if there was a non pretax deduction on your pay check that would keep the check at zero but there would be taxes owed this might be union dues but it can also be some life and disability insurance polices most stubs specify which deductions are pre tax and which are post tax warning if you get the company match some companies give you the maximum match for those 7 weeks then zero for the rest of the year others will still credit you with a match at the end of the year saying if you should get the benefit it is not required that they do this check the company documents you could also contribute post tax money which is different than roth 401 k for the rest of the year to keep the match going note if you are turning 50 this year or are already 50 then you can contribute an additional $ 5,500

if you 're willing to do a little more work and bookkeeping than just putting money into the 401(k i would recommend the following i note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high i would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw   past performance is no guarantee of future returns assuming the cash in your ally account is an emergency fund i would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level if the ally account is not an emergency fund i would make it one with no debt and an emergency fund for 3 12 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance then you can concentrate on investing your 401(k options are unfortunately pretty poor with those choices i would invest this way once you fill up your choice of ira then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any a brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency the 401(k will give you tax benefits but high fund expenses the tax benefits are considerable so if i were at a job where i plan on moving on in a few years i 'd fund the 401(k up to the max with the knowledge that i 'd roll the 401(k into a rollover ira in the relatively short term if i saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 + years i 'd probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time one you start building up a solid base then i might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for play money to pick individual stocks or start making sector bets

that 's an interesting assessment   i had a good read   i suppose it would be weird if we had more government   we only have 4.5 million people   i suspect effective government is a fairly low bar as we have plenty of improvement to make in a range of metrics   we are damaging the environment because of a lack of regulation on farmers activities   many rivers in the south island are not safe to swim in now   we have very high and growing income inequality   we are behind the times on drug reform and our incarceration rates and rates are an embarrassment   but importantly our system of governance is more representative we restrict campaign spending to small amounts of public money you see a few billboards and ads on tv which is proportional to the support that party has    we allow no outside funding although there has been some instances where private businesses have attempted to influence elections and the various parties are semi frequently caught and fined for trying to skirt these restrictions   i think that 's the main reason we manage to get things pretty right in a trend towards good policy over time

it 's actually quite simple you 're actually confusing two concept which are taking a short position and short selling itself basically when taking a short position is by believing that the stock is going to drop and you sell it you can or not buy it back later depending on the believe it grows again or not so basically you did n't make any profit with the drop in the price 's value but you did n't lose money either   ok but what if you believe the market or specific company is going to drop and you want to profit on it while it 's dropping you ca n't do this by buying stock because you would be going long right so back to the basics to obtain any type of profit i need to buy low and sell high right this is natural for use in long positions well now knowing that you can sell high at the current moment and buy low in the future what do you do you ca n't sell what you do n't have so acquire it ask someone to lend it to you for some time and sell it so selling high check   now buying low you promised the person you would return him his stock as it 's intangible he wo n't even notice it 's a different unit so you buy low and return the lender his stock thus you bought low and sold high meaning having a profit so technically short selling is a type of short position if you have multiple portfolios and lend yourself i.e. maintaining a long term long position while making some money with a short term short term strategy you 're actually short selling with your own stock this happens often in hedge funds where multiple strategies are used and to the transaction costs and borrowing fees they have algorithms that clear match long and short coming in from different traders algorithms etc keep in mind that you while have a opportunities risk associated   so basically yes you need to always borrow a product to be able to short sell it what can happen is that you lend yourself but this only makes sense if

hi all confused about how employee option pools interact with pre money and post money vc valuations   from what i understand the pool essentially dilutes pre money valuation a quote from startup tools calculating true pre money valuation    gt say the vc wants 20 if the company is valued at $ 10 m then the vc would put in $ 2.5 m for a post money of $ 12.5 m $ 2.5 m $ 12.5 m = 20 however if a 30 option pool is added then the post money will be $ 20 m the pool will be $ 6 m and the vc will put in $ 4 m $ 1.5 m or 60 more than before the pre money would have jumped to $   i get that in both cases the founder stays at a $ m true valuation and a pool dilutes founder pre money ownership from to in this case but it seems like the pool is adding value out of nowhere the only additional money is coming from the vc but somehow the pool is worth $ 6 m

most likely that 's the amount of interest that accrued on the loan while you were in school   if you had paid that amount before you would have just paid off accrued interest and your loan balance would have stayed the same since you did not pay the interest it will be added to your loan balance and you will just pay it off as part of the loan plus compounded interest    if you pay off your loan at 5 over 30 years hopefully you wo n't but that 's what they 're amortized for that $ 350 will compound and become $   essentially you 're borrowing $ 350 at 5 interest for 30 years hopefully that motivates you to pay it off sooner that that

conceptually yes you need to worry about it   as a practical matter it 's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior the way to think about paying a european option is odds of paying out = odds that strike is in the money at expiry whereas the american option can be thought of as odds of paying out = odds that strike price is in the money at expiry + odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry odds that other party will exercise early this is just a heuristic not a formal financial tool   but the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early for how long maybe over multiple periods and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side long straddle quick turnaround the length of time the option is in the money early and the anticipated future movement a quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around   but that could leave further gains on the table so it 's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement   this sort of counter market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option   so most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff a long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option the choice to get out of the option if it goes back to being unprofitable   so it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early   the same goes for a straddle if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position so you 're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the american option   that may include people who really want to close a position take their money and move on   in some cases it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity so they close positions   but for the most part it 's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table   the time value of an option at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely especially if the option is fairly deep in the money the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money so early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches   otherwise it 's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition

the insurance company is must assume you do have a preexisting condition you are unaware of   the reason for that is that affordable care act precludes the insurance company from denying coverage of them if you do   insurance companies are businesses   they are in business to make you have a nonprofit insurer   they can not do that if you can buy insurance only when you need for them to pay out   so even though you may not have a preexisting condition they are from requiring an examination that would detect the most expensive preexisting conditions hidden cancers disorders   so the companies must do what takes business sense and either deny you coverage or charge a rate that covers the risk they would be forced to take    in your question on travel there was a response that suggested you get international health insurance instead of travel health insurance that would be considered credible coverage   you are trying to save money which on a personal level is a good idea   however that is against the societal and business need that you maintain health coverage during your healthy times to cover the costs of those who need expensive treatment   so you will be monetarily penalized should you choose to the society of insured people   once you have paid the higher rate for up to 18 months you should be able to get a better policy for people who have had continuous coverage   alternately you may be lucky enough to start working for a company that provides health insurance with out requiring continuous coverage

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

two factors that positively your credit score are the number of open accounts you have in good standing and the average age of the accounts the more accounts you have in good standing the more likely you seem to pay back what you borrow from new creditors the older the average age of the accounts the more you seem like an experienced borrower who has had many years of successful credit activity closing them would lower the total number of accounts in good standing you have and would also likely lower the average account age unless you 've recently opened them to simplify the number of cards you have pick the one or two you would consider cancelling worst rewards benefits highest yearly fee etc and just do n't keep them in your wallet anymore you do n't have to worry about paying them off every month because you do n't buy anything with them and you still get the credit score benefits of having the accounts open

i think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done stop and ask yourself what would you do if they do n't do what they promised they know who you are but usually most you know is a company name and phone number both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with   if they said they 'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan fine let them do it and then you pay them if they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything unless it 's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it either it 's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much you 're giving money and not getting anything in return

sounds you need to read up on s corp structures i think this would benefit you if you generate income even after you physically stopped working which is incomes from membership fees royalties of customer revenue middle man etc   under the you as the sole member must earn a wage that fair and at current market value you pay social security and medicare on this wage the interesting thing here is that an can pay out earning dividends   without having to pay payroll taxes but the catch is that you as the sole employee must earn a fair wage    as for paying the other member you may want to look into 1099 contract work plus a finders fee the 1099 hourly wage does not require you to pay medicare and ss    the common fee i 'm used to is 5 of gross invoice then you would pay her an hourly wage the company then bills these hours multiplied by 2 or 3 or whatever you think is fair to the client deduct expenses from this and that 's your profit    example contractor brings client a which is estimated as a   100 hour project with $ 100 cost in supplies and requires 2 hours of your time $    you quote 100 hours $ 50 to client client agrees and gives you down payment    you then present the contract work to your contractor they complete the work in 100 hours and bill you at $ 25    you pay your contractor 2500 plus the 5 $ 250   and your company earns $ 5000 2500 100 80   and you 'll earn $ 80 minus the payroll tax    then at the end of the quarter or year or however you want to do earning payouts your will write you a check for $ or whatever earning you want to take this is then taxed at your income tax bracket    one thing to keep in mind is what is preventing this other person from becoming your competition a partnership would be great motivation to try and bring in as much work under the llc but if you start people then they 'll just keep the work and cut you out

there is one massive catch in this which i found out when i went to nationwide to ask for a loan i 've got a credit card which they kept increasing my credit limit it 's now at something ridiculous nearly £ 10,000 but they keep increasing it i never use that card when i went to nationwide though they said they could n't give me a loan because i had £ 10,000 credit already and if i reduced this credit this would affect my credit rating and they could potentially give me a loan i then realised what had done   i have two cards with this bank one with really low interest and the other with really high interest and a high credit limit even though the other card has a zero balance loan companies still see it as money i could potentially go and spend it does n't matter to them that i 've not spent any money on that card in about 12 months to them it 's the fact that they could give me a loan and then i could go and spend another £ 10,000 on that card as you can see extremely risky    of course this means that what are doing is giving me such a high credit knowing full well that i 'm not going to use it but it also prevents their competitors from offering me a loan even at a lower rate because i 've already got too much credit available so yes there is a catch to giving you a high credit limit on your cards and it 's to prevent you from either leaving that bank or getting a lower interest rate loan out to clear the debt

you file taxes as usual w2 is a form given to you you do n't need to fill it similarly 1099 both report moneys paid to you by your employers w2 is for actual employer the one where you 're on the payroll 1099 is for contractors where you invoice the entity you provide services to and get paid per contract you need to look at form 1040 and its instructions as to how exactly to fill it that would be the annual tax return it has various schedules a b c d e f h etc which you should familiarize yourself with and various additional forms that you attach to it if you 're self employed you 're expected   to make quarterly estimate payments but if you 're a salaried employee you can instruct your employer to withhold the amounts you expect to owe for taxes from your salary instead if you 're using a tax preparation software like turbotax or taxact it will interview you to get all the needed information and provide you with the forms filled accordingly alternatively you can pay someone to prepare the tax return for you

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

everyone should keep track of what they spend when you see how much you are spending on each category of expense you can make good decisions about how much your life is improved by something vs. how much you spend on that thing   everyone makes better decisions when they are informed by accurate information about those decisions there 's no reason why personal finances are different from any other decision you make in life this remains true whether you make very little or very much some people define rich as being able to live on less money than you earn

if you do n't receive a w2 there are 2 scenarios you should consider if you have reason to believe that scenario 1 is accurate then you could file your taxes based on the last valid paycheck you received if you have reason to believe that scenario 2 is accurate then you need to do some extra math but fortunately it is straight forward simply treat your final paychecks as if the gross amount of your check was equal to the sum of your taxes paid and the net amount of the check is $ 0 this way your income will increase by the proper amount and you will still receive credit for the taxes paid this should work out cleanly for federal and state taxes but will likely result in an overpayment of fica taxes you can use form 843 to receive a refund of excess fica taxes as a side note i 'd recommend spot checking the ytd numbers on your last paychecks against previous to make sure there was n't any fuzzy math going on when they realized they were going out of business
