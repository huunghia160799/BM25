one big factor that no one has mentioned yet is whether you believe in a deflationary or inflationary future right now we are leaning towards a deflationary environment so it makes sense to pay off more of the debt if you make just one extra payment a year you will have paid off your house 7 years early however should this change depending on government and central bank policy you may be better off putting down the very minimum   in a year or three from now you should have a clearer picture in the meanwhile here is a recent business week article discussing both sides of the argument

i 'd stick with 20 down truth is we do n't know enough about you are you single and staying that way how is your retirement savings doing as others asked any other debt you can put 20 down take a breath and see how it 's going i did just that the 20 we then had a baby and 5 nanny years to pay for when she was gone all that money went to the mortgage and after refinancing with no points no closing we have 7 years to go just under 20 years beginning to end during that time we 've saved for college just about fully funded and for retirement both with matched 401(k accounts   remember if you lose your job a house with a lower mortgage means nothing when there 's still the next payment due but that cushion of cash can be handy

the primary reason to put 20 down on your home is to avoid paying pmi private mortgage insurance   anyone who buys a house with a down payment of under 20 is required to pay for this insurance which protects the lender in case you default on your loan pmi is what enables people to buy homes with as little as 3 5 down i would recommend against paying more than 20 because having liquidity for emergency funds or other investments will give you the sort of flexibility that 's good to have when the economy is n't so great   depending on whether the house you purchase is move in ready or a fixer upper having funds set aside for repairs is a good idea as well

first of all realize that buying a home is n't really an investment   it is cheaper to rent   in recent years people were able to sell their houses for astronomical profits but that wo n't be happening much in the future   additionally there are many hidden costs of owning a home regarding the mortgage interest tax deduction do n't buy a house just to get this   it is like spending $ 1 to get back some amount of money less than $ 1   so just keep that in mind are you debt free   if not pay off your other debts before buying a home   i follow the advice of dave ramsey so i 'll echo it here   make sure you have an emergency fund and no debt at this point i think you are ready to buy a house   when you do put down as much as you can above 20 if possible   then get a 15 year fixed rate mortgage at this point start saving for your kid 's college if you believe in that and paying down your home having no mortgage is a dream many people never have   i can not wait until i have no mortgage   do n't get suckered into getting a high priced loan   pay down as much of the price of the house as possible up front   this gives you flexibility too   what if you need to sell quickly   well you will have equity from the get go so this will be much easier good luck with your purchase

leverage increase returns but also risks ie the least you can pay the greater the opportunity to profit but also the greater the chance you will be underwater leverage is given by the value of your asset the house over the equity you put down so for example if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k then the leverage is 5 another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin or percentage down payment so = 5 the return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage suppose the value of your house goes up by 10 had you paid your house in full your return would be 10 or however if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5 as above a 10 increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment a return of 50 or as i said your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage that is 10 return on the asset times your leverage of 5 = 50 this is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house what you borrowed from the bank remains the same regardless of whether the price of the house changed the problem is that the mechanism also works in reverse if the price of the house falls by 10 it means now you only have 10k equity if the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater giving you an incentive to default on your loan in summary borrowing tends to be a really good deal heads you win tails the bank loses or as happened in the us the taxpayer loses

the more you put down now the less money you are borrowing   of interest adds up even paying a small amount at the beginning of the mortgage can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan that 's why you 'll find advice to make extra mortgage payments in the beginning   the question is do you have a better use for that money    in particular do you have any higher interest debt higher apr than your mortgage that needs to be paid off   you generally want to take care of those first    beyond that can you invest the extra down payment money elsewhere eg stock market and get a better return than your mortgage rate   do n't forget about taxes on investment profits if so that money will do more good there

the other factor in increasing disability claims is that during an up economy someone with a disability can probably get a job doing what little they are able to   go through a down turn and no employer is going to hire a worker that has a known disability that might in any way limit their productivity   so having a disability can go from having a lower paid job to having no job and no chance of getting one

whenever you put less than 20 down you are usually required to pay private mortgage insurance pmi to protect the lender in case you default on your loan   you pay this until you reach 20 equity in your home   check out an amortization calculator to see how long that would take you   most schedules have you paying more interest at the start of your loan and less principal   pmi gets you nothing no interest or principal paid it 's throwing money away in a very real sense more in this answer   still if you want to do it make sure to add pmi to the cost per month it is also possible to get two mortgages one for your 20 down payment and one for the 80 and avoid pmi   lenders are fairly cautious about doing that right now given the housing crash but you may be able to find one who will let you do the two mortgages   this will raise your monthly payment in its own way of course also remember to factor in the costs of home ownership into your calculations   check the county or city website to figure out the property tax on that home divide by twelve and add that number to your payment   estimate your homeowners insurance of course you get to drop renters insurance so make sure to calculate that on the renting side of the costs and divide the yearly cost by 12 and add that in   most importantly add 1 2 of the value of the house yearly for maintenance and repair costs to your budget   all those costs are going to eat away at your 3 400 a little bit   so you 've got to save about $ 70 a month towards repairs etc for the case of every 10 50 years when you need a new roof and so on many experts suggest having the maintenance money in savings on top of your emergency fund from day one of ownership in case your water heater suddenly dies or your roof starts leaking   make sure you 've also estimated closing costs on this house or that the seller will pay your costs   otherwise you loose part of that from your down payment or other savings once you add up all those numbers you can figure out if buying is a good proposition   with the plan to stay put for five years it sounds like it truly might be   i 'm not arguing against it just laying out all the factors for you the nyt rent versus buy calculator lays out most of these items in terms of renting or buying and might help you make that decision edit as tim noted in the comments below real monthly cost should take into account deductions from mortgage interest and property tax paid   this calculator can help you figure that out   this question will be one to watch for answers on how to calculate cost and return on home buying with the answer by mbhunter being an important qualification

the cash credit from unsettled activity occurs because agg issued a dividend in the past week since you purchased the etf long enough before the record date june 5 2013 for that trade to settle you qualified for a dividend the dividend distribution was $ for each of your six shares for a total credit of $ = 6 for any etf the company 's website should tell you when dividends are issued usually under a section titled distributions or something similar if you look in your fidelity account 's history page it should show an entry of dividend received which confirms that the cash credit is coming from a dividend distribution you could look up your holdings and see which recently issued a dividend in this case it was agg

if she is a legitimate owner you ca n't force her to sell her interest in the house you can communicate indirectly with her perhaps through a lawyer and see if she is willing to sign something authorizing you to sell unless she is mentally incompetent you will likely have a very difficult time of proceeding with a legal challenge at minimum she should be paying you rent if she is the sole and if she is unwilling to let you live in the house or pay you rent as co owners you could possibly proceed with a suit along those lines this is a good example of why it 's not ideal to co own a home with someone you are n't legally married to including a relative or someone you are dating because there is no relatively simple process similar to divorce which determines the allocation of property in the case of a serious dispute if living together it may be preferable to have one party own the home and rent it to another if inherited it may be preferable for one party to buy out the others and rent it back to them or arrange for a portion of any money made through the sale or rental of the home best of luck i hope you are able to reach an agreeable outcome

i doubt that this exists but it could theoretically after all a share is kind of an option to a company 's future success and so a call is already a second level on the better approach would be to create your own put puts by investing less money a in the put you wanted to invest into and put the smaller rest b in the share itself or a call that way if the original put is successful at max b is lost and if it is unsuccessful the loss on a is covered by a gain on b potentially if you do the math you can reach a mathematical equivalent situation to a put put by buying the right amount and kind of calls however we know already that buying a put and a call is a poor strategy so that would mean a put put would also be a poor strategy

the other answers are talking about seller financing   there is another type of arrangement that might be described as writing your own mortgage where the buyer arranges his or her own financing   instead of using a bank a buyer might find his own investor to hold the mortgage for him an example would be if i were to buy a house that needs fixing up   i might be able to buy a house for $ 40,000 but after i fix it up i believe it will sell for $ 100,000   instead of going through a traditional mortgage bank i find an investor with cash that agrees the house is a good deal and we arrange for the investor to provide funds for the purchase of the house on a short term basis perhaps interest only during which i fix up the house and sell it   just like a regular mortgage the loan is backed by the house itself i am not recommending this type of arrangement by any means but this article does a good job of describing how this would work   it is written by a real estate guru with lots of training courses and coaching materials that she would like to sell you

sipc is a corporation a legal entity separate from its owners in the case of sipc it is funded through the fees paid by its members all the us brokers are required to be members and to contribute to sipc funds can it go bankrupt of course any legal entity can go bankrupt a person can go bankrupt a country can go bankrupt and so can anything in between however looking at the history of things there are certain assumptions that can be made these are mere guesses as there 's no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge but seeing how things were we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future i would guess that in case of a problem for the sipc to meet its obligation any of the following would happen or combinations too big to fail large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout aig as an example in the us sipc is in essence is an insurance company so is lloyd 's of london breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash that 's what happened in the us to fannie mae and freddie mac they 're now officially backed by the us government if sipc is incapable of meeting its obligation i would definitely expect the us government to step in even though there 's no such obligation raising funds through charging other members if the actuary calculations were incorrect the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums that is what should happen in this case as well while may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue in the long term it will allow sipc to balance so that bridge loans from the us government feds public bonds could be used in between not meeting obligations i.e. bankruptcy that is an option and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before not unheard of but from the past experience again i 'd expect the us government to step in in general i do n't see any significant difference between sipc in the us and a generic insurance coverage elsewhere except that in the us sipc is mandatory well regulated and the coverage is uniform across brokerages which is a benefit to the consumer

if you have an s corp with several shareholders you probably also have a tax adviser who suggested using s corp to begin with   you 're probably best off asking that adviser about this issue if you decided to use s corp for multiple shareholders without a professional guiding you you should probably start looking for such a professional or you may get yourself into trouble that said and reminding you that 1 free advice on the internet is worth exactly what you paid for it and 2 i 'm not a tax professional or tax adviser you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state here 's this generally s corps are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their income flows to their shareholders individual tax returns through k-1 forms distributed by the s corp yearly the shareholders do n't have to actually withdraw the profits but if not withdrawing they 're added to their cost bases in the shares i 'm guessing your corp does n't distribute the net income but keeps it on the corporate account only distributing enough to cover the shareholders taxes on their respective income portion in this case the amount not distributed is added to their basis the amount distributed has already been taxed through k-1 if the corporation distributes more than the shareholder 's portion of net income then there can be several different choices depending on the circumstances the extra distribution will be treated as salary to the shareholder and a deduction to the corporation i.e. increasing the net income for the rest of the shareholders the extra distribution will be treated as return of investment reducing that shareholder 's basis in the shares but not affecting the other shareholders if the basis is 0 then it is treated as income to the shareholder and taxed at ordinary rates the extra distribution will be treated as buy back reducing that shareholder 's ownership stake in the company and reallocating the bought back portion among the rest of the shareholders in this case it is treated as a sale of stock and the gain is calculated as with any other stock sale including short term vs. long term taxation there 's also sec that can come in handy here the extra distribution will be treated as dividend this is very rare for s corp but can happen if it was a c corp before in that case it will be taxed as dividends note that options 2 3 and 4 subject the shareholder to the while option 1 subjects the shareholder to fica self employment tax and subjects the company to payroll taxes there might be other options your licensed tax adviser will go with you through all the facts and circumstances and will suggest the best way to proceed

to get the probability of hitting a target price you need a little more math and an assumption about the expected return of your stock   first let 's examine the parts of this expression iv is the implied volatility of the option   that means it 's the volatility of the underlying that is associated with the observed option price   as a practical matter volatility is the standard deviation of returns expressed in annualized terms   so if the monthly standard deviation is y then is the volatility from the above you can see that de the volatility to get back to a standard deviation   so you get an estimate of the expected standard deviation of the return between now and expiration if you multiply this by the stock price then you get what you have called x which is the standard deviation of the dollars gained or lost between now and expiration   denote the price change by a so that the standard deviation of a is x note that we seek the expression for the probability of hitting a target level q so mathematically we want 1 pr a < q   we do 1 minus the probability of being below this threshold because cumulative distribution functions always find the probability of being below a threshold not above if you are using excel and assuming a mean of zero for returns the probability of hitting or exceeding q at expiration then is that 's your answer for the probability of exceeding q. accuracy is in the eye of the   you 'd have to specify a criterion by which to judge it to know the answer   i 'm sure more sophisticated methods exist that are more unbiased and have less error but i think it 's a fine first approximation

first let 's look at the tax brackets for single taxpayers in 2016 the cutoff between the 25 and 28 tax bracket is $   you said that your gross is $   this will be reduced by deductions and exemptions at least $ 10,350   your rental income will increase your income but it is offset in part by your rental business expenses for this year you will almost certainly be in the 25 bracket whether or not you receive your this year   next year if you receive your then and your salary is $ 11k higher i 'm guessing you 'll be close to the edge it is important to remember that the tax brackets are marginal   this means that when you move up to the next tax bracket it is only the amount of income that puts you over the top that is taxed at the higher rate   you can see this in the chart above   so if for example your taxable income ends up being $ you 'll be in the 28 tax bracket but only $ 10 of your income will be taxed at 28   the rest will be taxed at 25 or lower   as a result this probably is n't worth worrying about too much a bit more explanation requested by the op here is how to understand the numbers in the tax bracket chart   let 's take a look at the second line $   the tax rate is explained as $ plus 15 of the amount over $ 9,275   the first $ 9,275 of your taxable income is taxed at a 10 rate   so if your total taxable income falls between $ and $ 37,650 the first $ 9,275 is taxed at 10 a tax of $ and the amount over $ 9,275 is taxed at 15   on each line of the chart the amount of tax from all the previous brackets is carried down so you do n't have to calculate it when i said that you have at least $ 10,350 in deductions and exemptions i got that number from the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount   for 2016 the standard deduction for single taxpayers is $ 6,300   if you itemize your deductions you might be able to deduct more   personal exemptions for 2016 are at $ 4,050 per person   that means you get to reduce your taxable income by $ 4,050 for each person in your household   since you are single with no dependents your standard deduction plus the personal exemption for yourself will result in a reduction of at least $ 10,350 on your taxable income

you 're right the issue of inversion is not going to go away as long as there are countries willing to go to 2 on their tax rate   but the goal is n't really to eliminate them it 's to have a tax system and regulatory system which encourages healthy business growth and financial support to the government   the path the us has chosen is high corporate tax cherry pick activities they want to encourage through breaks then rely on taxing overseas profits on money returned to the us since so many major companies are us based   this was a great system but its an since globalization became a real thing   now what it has left us with is a tax incentive system where only the business activities with breaks rd tax credit are considered worthwhile ventures while profit centers are   then no one can reinvest their profits in the us because they ca n't repatriate cash without paying tax   the corporate tax structure now hinders employment and investment   we do n't need to lower our taxes to 0 to be competitive   the most popular countries for offshoring are puerto rico pharma ireland and switzerland their tax rates are effectively 0   however due to other costs employment transportation of goods on a total cost basis the us can be more than competitive with a corp tax rate of 20

the amount you are earning in the savings account is insignificant since you would only have the money in the account for 1 month after purchasing the car   the instant 1.5 cashback or travel mile reward on the other hand can be significant however it is not normal for a car dealership to allow you to put $ 16k on a credit card   the reason is that the fees that the dealer has to pay to process your credit card would be too burdensome   car dealers have a much smaller profit margin on their sales than a typical retail store so if the dealer has to pay 3 or 4 of the sales price in credit card fees it just eats up too much of their profit if the dealer does allow you to put the entire purchase price on a credit card be aware that they have already factored in their processing fees into the price   you might be able to get a better than 1.5 discount by offering to pay with cash instead

a credit card is essentially a contract where they will loan you money in an on demand basis   it is not a contract for you to loan them money the money that you have overpaid is generally treated as if it is a payment for a charge that you have made that has not been processed yet   the bank can not treat that money as a deposit and thus leverage it make money them selves you can open an account and get a debit card   this would allow you to accrue interest for your deposit while using your money   but if you find one willing to pay you 25 interest please share with the rest of us

most of the time when a stock splits to create more shares it is done to bring the price per share down to a level that makes potential investors more comfortable there are psychological reasons why some companies keep the price in the $ 30 to $ 60 range others like to have the price keep rising into the hundreds or thousands a share   the split does n't help current investors with the possible exception that the news spurs interest in the stock which leads to a short term rise in prices but it also does n't hurt current investors when a reverse stock split is done the purpose is for one of several reasons

virtual credit card it there something like virtual credit card yes there is we have banks in india hdfc and bank that allows you to generate a virtual credit card which could be used for payments on websites these cards are one time use cards and will expire as soon as you use it once the mail objective behind such virtual card service is to protect the actually card information to be shared on websites take a look its call and remember hdfc is a very reputed bank in india   moving further about the company entropay take a look at the website most of the information you need to know about the company starts from the website data lets take a look at the contact us page   any company that deals in financial services business has to be registered under financial services authority of the country they are doing business in this company is based in malta and should definitely be registered with malta financial services authority the company claims that they are registered with fsa under license registration number sounds great everything is perfect but just to make sure i thought of taking a look at the website on the activity of the company here 's a link under license holder tried searching for the company systems ltd. and here is what i found   there was no record of the company on the database i even tried not searching and looking into the complete database but no such company on the list by the way look i found western union there   what i mean to say here is only one thing any company that deals in financial transactions need to be registered with the local financial services of the country they have their physical address in if suppose western union is an american company with physical existence in 100 countries they not only have to be registered with financial services authority in us but also in every other countries they have their physical address in i know many of you will still argue that it has a valid logo which means it 's a company with physical address and its been verified but please remember its very easy to fool those guys coz almost every verification is done online also the information of this company shows its a company registered in uk not malta just to be very sure again i also checked the fsa website of uk there is no such company under fsa regulations even in uk i would want to give you the answer to your question very but i had a bad experience today on this same website so i would rather allow you make the decision wether its a legit company or a scam

others have commented on the various studies if as joetaxpayer says this one particular study he mentions does not really exist there are plenty of others and in that case did someone blatantly lie to prove a bogus point or did someone just get the name of the organization that did the study wrong like it was really somebody called they read it as because they 'd heard of dun bradstreet but not of whoever is of course if they got the organization wrong maybe they got important details of the study wrong whatever   but let me add one logical point that i think is if you always buy with cash there is no way that you can spend more than you have when you run out of cash you have no choice but to stop spending but when you buy with a credit card you can easily spend more than you have money in the bank to pay even if it is true that most credit card users are responsible there will always be some who are not and credit cards make it easy to get in trouble   i speak from experience i once learned that my wife had run up $ 20,000 in credit card debt without my knowledge when she divorced me i got stuck with the credit card debt to this day i have no idea what she spent the money on and i 've known several people over the years who have gone bankrupt with credit card debt even if you 're responsible it 's easy to lose track with credit cards if you use cash when you take out your wallet to buy something you can quickly see whether there 's a lot of money left or not so much with credit you can forget that you made the big purchase more likely you can fail to add up the modest purchases it 's easy to say oh that 's just $ 100 i can cover that but then there 's $ 100 here and $ 100 there and it can add up or depending on your income level maybe it 's $ 10 here and $ 10 there and it 's out of hand or maybe it 's $ 10,000 it 's easier today when you can go on line and check the balance on your credit card but even at that well just this past month when i got one bill i was surprised at how big it was i went through the items and they were all legitimate they just added up do n't cry for me i could afford it but i had failed to pay attention to what i was spending and i let things get a little out of hand i 'm a pretty responsible person and i do n't do that often i can easily imagine someone paying less attention and getting into serious trouble

there are two very large negative factors that affect yahoo 's valuation    the first is that their search business is in decline and continues to lose ground to google and even bing   there 's no sign that they have any plan or product in the works to offset this decline so there 's tremendous uncertainty about the company 's forward looking revenues the second is that the company ca n't seem to decide what to do with its stake in alibaba clearly the company 's most valuable asset   it they sell it the question then becomes what they plan to do with the proceeds   will they do share buybacks or offer a special dividend to reward investors   will they use some or all of the money to make strategic acquisitions that are revenue enhancing   will they use it to develop new products services    keep in mind one other thing here too   there 's a world of difference between what something is valued at and what someone 's willing to actually pay for it   a patent portfolio is great and perhaps holds good value assuming the buyer can find a way to monetize it   how exactly was the valuation of the patents arrived at and are they worthwhile enough for someone to pay anywhere close to that valuation    there 's more to this than meets the eye by using a first look at asset valuation and that 's where the professionals come in   my bet is that they have it right and there 's something the rest of the market does n't see or understand about it hence questions like yours i hope this helps good luck

why do online services ask for all those cvv codes and expiration date information if whenever you poke the card out of your wallet all of its information becomes visible to everyone in the close area what can i do to secure myself i 'd guess that 's to protect the card company not you   the number of the card is but each other bit of information makes it much harder to guess the cvv code makes it times harder the expiration date makes it about 50 100 times harder   since you would n't be responsible for the payment anyway adding security for online transactions provides the company with less liability as for the security of your information online that 's trickier it depends entirely on the site you 're using whether they 've implemented the appropriate security measures or not and given the ssl attacks we 've seen even that might not help   source i 'm a web developer and have worked on payments systems before that implemented the security mandated by the cards   at the very least never ever type in your information on a non https site there 's normally a little lock icon that will display if you 're on https instead of http

let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university quick story of my student loan   i graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early   i deferred   schools will have rules for   there are also federal guidelines lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems    so basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted   then there is an extended deferment   here someone has to ok it   this is really rather arbitrary and up to the school lender   my school decided to not extend mine after i filled out a of paperwork and showed that even without paying i had basically $ 200 a month for the family to live off past housing fixed expenses eventually they had to cave because i had no money so they gave me an extended deferment   after the 5 years i started paying   since my school had a very complex way to pay i decided to give them 6 months at a time   you would think they would love that right   on the check it was clearly stated what months i was paying for to show that i was not prepaying the loan off well i was in collections 4 months later   their billing messed up set me up for prepayment   they then played dumb and acted like i did n't but i had a picture of the check and their bank 's stamp on the back they could n't get my loan out of collections even though they messed up   this is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake   so this office tells creditors to leave me alone but i also cannot pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan   so my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this   it was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing point being is that if you do n't pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you   most not all schools will opt for deferment which i believe is 2 years at most places   then after that you have the optional deferment   so if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket    however if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none unless school does n't know where you live   basically if you do n't respond to their mail emails you get swept into their credit collection process   so just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it even if they deny it could buy you up to 10 years kid you not    now once you go into the collection process anything is game   as long as you do n't need a home car loan you can play this game   what the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules   if you are at a major university the rules are usually more lax but if you are at the smaller schools especially the advertised trade online schools boom better watch out   wages will be garnished very soon   expect to go to court might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start on fees think of the 5k mine on me    so the moral of the story is you will pay it off   if you act nice fill out paperwork talk to school and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years   but you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything   so factor in that to the equation   i had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now    defaulting is n't always a bad thing   if you do n't have the money then you do n't have it   and using credit cards to help is not the thing to do   but you need to try to work with the school so you do n't incur penalties fees and so that your job does n't have creditors calling them    my story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection   a higher up was reviewing my case and called me   told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check   she was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and i am like how about i come down tomorrow with the 7k   but even though lender admitted fault this took 20 + calls to agencies to clear up my credit so i could buy a house    so your goal should be

gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end   means takes the shape of currency in this form we value gold in the same way we value the dollar it allows us to purchase things we want as a medium of exchange gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange for example i would be valuing one of gold to be worth a dog if i traded a dog for one of gold the value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction gold as an end is valued for its own sake a good example of this is a who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic gold possesses this is closer to the true value of gold than using it as a means but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor you know what i could use right now a block of gold said no one ever   but even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake this is usually done because gold provides a function for example if people no longer want to jewelry then a will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends to sum up gold has a perceived value for most people and an intrinsic value to a select few for the time being

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

the fact that this is what ’s being reported is horribly misleading   at the bottom of the same page of that report there is data intended to show the difference between the pay rates in this data accidently proves that individual incomes are still stagnant and that the reason for our increased household wages is that more people per household are working and part timers are working longer hours following is how this conclusion is drawn   the section titled earnings of full time year round workers can be used to find 2015 ’s average income per full time worker and 2016 ’s average income per full time worker the 2015 data shows that men made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ women made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ this means that the average income for a full time year round worker in 2015 was $ x + x   the 2016 data shows that men made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ women made up of the population and earned $ this means the average income for a full time year round worker in 2016 was $ x + x   so while the news is reporting the increase in household income the average income for a full time year round worker actually fell by $ in 2016

i 'll add a little to the already great advice here it certainly sounds like you are in need of consolidation here having 11 different cards for your attention sounds like a nightmare to manage i also concur that it is a bad idea to cash out your retirement accounts to deal with this i know it 's frustrating to have the debt hanging over your head i have student loans i 'm personally working on but getting a loan to consolidate that level of noise sounds like a much smarter move that can help greatly if you have high interest cards most likely the case here since you mentioned that you are not interested in selling the house have you considered a home equity loan to consolidate this best of luck to you

the breakeven amount is n't at 8 years you calculated how many years of paying $ 500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $ 4000 8 x 10 years = 80 years so by paying $ 500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount $ 40000 total as you did in 10 years at this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is consider where you 'll be after 10 years in scenario 1 you 've spent $ 5000 $ 500 10 and have to continue spending $ 500/year indefinitely in scenario 2 you 've spent $ 40000 $ 4000 10 and do n't have to pay any more but you currently have $ $ 40000 $ 5000 less than you did in scenario 1 if you had stayed with scenario 1 you could invest that $ at a measly 1.43 annual return and cover the $ 500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $ most likely over the long term you 'll do better than 1.43 per year and come out far ahead

hey no worries at all like any business practice there are proper uses and abuses first and foremost companies should engage in allocation of capital that best serves their uses given prospects of returns in a broad sense this could very well include employee remuneration after that all excess funds should be distributed through buybacks or dividends    there is without a doubt going on i.e. buybacks preceding prudent capex or other investments to boost c suite pay in other cases it is actually used to hide declining performance altogether declining earnings compensated by decreasing outstanding shares this is simply poor management using these tools they would have most likely used others were these not made available to them e.g underpaying    it 's an investors job to allocate capital that rewards good management practice the problem is that this is an ideal made harder by obfuscation on the part of management lack of governance and even the rise of passive management among others    i 'm in private equity myself with a strong focus on prudence and longevity of companies so these are considerations that go without saying i 'm sometimes quite what public companies get away with but you ca n't blame tools for being used poorly or being available

they may be willing to issue mortgages with smaller deposits but may take longer to make a decision that can not be farther from the truth if you are getting a mortgage on a smaller deposit you will be paying a higher interest rate time to take a decision depends very much on your credit situation earnings spending and the amount of loan you want to avail of advantages and disadvantages compared to banks today nothing specifically that is obvious you deposits are guaranteed by fscs which is primarily everybody 's biggest concern one thing i did observe was they generally have saving accounts which pay better than the big banks but that is for one to compare and find out   in ownership structure you own a part of the building society because you are a member by having an mortgage with them not the case with a big bank though unless you own any shares you can make a case for the difference of the big bank 's multiple business as compared to a building society

i 'd encourage you to use rules of thumb and back of the envelope here are some ideas that could be useful the problem with any kind of detailed calculations is the number of unknowns there are some really complex calculators out there for example see caution horrible user interface but seemed to work that will include all kinds of factors and run monte carlo and the whole thing but in my opinion it 's just as good or better to say save at least 15 of income until you have 25x what you spend or some other such rule of thumb here 's my little blog post on savings and investing fwiw http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ another note there 's sort of an ideology of how to live embedded in any retirement recommendation and you might want to take the time to reflect on that and consciously choose a book on this topic is your money or your life by robin which is a sort of radical you should save everything possible to achieve financial independence as early as possible argument i did n't go for their plan but i think it 's thought provoking a newer book that may be more appealing is called the number   and it 's about your question exactly it 's more designed to get you thinking while your money or your life has a particular answer in mind both have some math and some rules of thumb though they are n't focused on that a kind of general takeaway from these books might be first think about your expenses what are you trying to accomplish in life how would you like to spend your time and then ask how much money you absolutely need to accomplish that and focus on accomplishing your goals spending your time as much as you can on what you 'd like to spend it on i 'm this with a generic recommendation to save enough to spend 80 of your income in retirement which this idea that you should spend as much as possible every year before and after you retire lots of people do like that idea but it 's not a law of the universe or something it 's just one popular approach

a home actually is a terrible investment it has all the traits of something you would never want to plunge your hard earned money into the only way that buying a house makes good money sense is if you pay cash for it and get a really good deal it should also be a house you can see yourself keeping for decades or until you 're older and want something easier to take care of of course nothing can replace sense of ownership or sense of pride other than owning a house and your local realtor is banking really laughing all the way to the bank on your emotions overcoming your smart money savvy this post really goes to work listing all the reasons why a house is a horrible investment should be required reading for everyone about to buy a house why your house is a terrible investment tldr you must decide what is more important the money or the feelings but you ca n't have both if you read the article linked and still want to buy a house then you probably should

your ignorance of global finance and business is showing through   conspiratorial just standard tax optimization scheme as shown by   google amp apple   the tech industry is fundamentally different from   that you ca n't see this is mind boggling   there is nothing standard about the tax optimization schemes done by apple and google that can be copied by grocers   apple and google have vast international operations with revenue coming from multiple countries   they are asset light and have very high profit margins   grocery stores have very small negligible international operations and are asset heavy   try also have very low profit margins   the point of supply and demand they are actually overpaid lots of desperate people that agree to the minimum allowed by law and below that if you include illegal aliens still does n't mean they are paying the living wage   mentioning living wages in an argument about supply and demand tips off that you have no clue what you are talking about   living wage is irrelevant to the supply and demand for labor   what you call desperation for a job dismissed many of the perfectly logical reasons why somebody may choose to work for a low wage   you assume that the equilibrium wage for grocery store workers is below the minimum wage falsely   walmart workers make more than minimum wage on average before benefits are taken into account   illegal aliens ca n't do most grocery store jobs because 1 they ca n't speak english and 2 they probably ca n't do the math needed to be a cashier   teenagers the vast majority of minimum wage workers are increasingly choosing not to work   the supply of people that are able to do these types of jobs is probably not much bigger than it is already   are imported   and they do n't have to set up a supply chain just the bare minimum to legally siphon funds into another company they own be it via interest on credit rent intellectual property i.e. franchise or trademark payments or anything else   this is laughable do you really believe this   grocery stores have absolutely massive supply chain risk   arguably their entire value proposition is in supply chain   you seem to think there 's an evil cabal moving money around to screw people over   this is left wing bullshit conspiracy stuff   you sound like a left wing version of alex jones   show me clear evidence that a grocer is doing this including references in their actual financial statements

sometimes a business must keep track of overhead expenses that can be used to determine the rates they will bill their customers especially the government when determining the rates they are allowed to charge the government they have to include direct costs and indirect costs these indirect costs include allowable overhead and they can also include profit but the government limits the maximum profit any expenses have to come out of profit   expenses include costs of amusement diversions social activities and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events meals lodging rentals transportation and are when they talk about meals and lodging being they are referring to those not needed to support the contract if the contract expects the contractor to travel they will generally provide a travel budget that is separate from the amounts used to determine the hourly rate the term slush fund has the connotation of being illegal or hidden slush funds are used to bribe officials or are leftover funds that were supposed to be spent and are now being hidden so that they can be misused at a later date

leverage here is referring to financial leverage this is the practice of levering ie increasing like the use of a lever to increase the amount of weight you can lift the value of your investment by taking on debt   for example if you have 100k in cash you can buy a 100k rental property assume the property makes 10k a year net of expenses 10 now assume the bank will also give you a 100k mortgage at 3 you could take the mortgage plus your cash and buy a 200k rental property this would earn you 20k from the rental property less 3k a year in interest costs the 3 your total income would be 17k and since you only used 100k of your own money your rate of return would now be 17 instead of 10 this is financial leveraging note that this increases your risk because if your investment fails not only have you lost your own money you now need to pay back the bank beta riders appears to be negative commentary on investors who use beta to calculate the value of a particular stock without regard to other quantitative factors therefore leveraged beta riders are those who take on additional risk by taking on debt to invest and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered blindly following beta however i have never seen this term before and it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants a quant process driven discipline appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow to invest i have never seen this exact phrasing before and like the above it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants i am not providing any opinion on whether beta riding or quant processes are good or bad things this is just my attempt to interpret the quote as you presented it note that i did not go to the article to get context so perhaps something else in the article could skew the language to mean something other than what i have presented

dollar cost averaging does n't or should n't apply here dca is the natural way we invest in the market buying in by a steady dollar amount each pay period so over time we can buy more shares when the market is down and fewer when it 's higher it 's more psychological than financial the fact is that given the market rises on average over time if one has a lump sum to invest it should be deployed based on other factors not just in as i said dca is just how we all naturally invest from our income   the above has nothing to do with your situation you are invested and wish to swap funds if the funds are with the same broker you should be able to execute this at the closing price the sell and buy happen after hours and you wake up the next day with the newly invested portfolio   if funds are getting transferred from broker to broker you do have a risk the risk that they take time say even 2 days when funds are not invested a shame to lose a 2 market move as the cost of moving brokers in this case i 'd do mine and my wife 's at different times to reduce that risk

as out by inflation figures are almost always quoted as a comparison of prices last month and prices a year ago last month   so 10 inflation in august means that things cost 10 more than they did in august a year ago   this can lead to some perverse conclusions consider an imaginary economy where prices stay constant over years   annualized inflation is zero then something happens on january 2nd 2018   some crop fails a foreign cheap source of something becomes unavailable whatever   prices rise permanently as more expensive sources are used this is the only disruption to prices nothing else goes wrong so in february 2018 the authorities find that prices in january 2018 rose by 1 over january 2017 inflation politicians pontificate economists wring their hands etc in march again prices for february 2018 are found to be 1 higher than for february 2017   more this goes on for months   every month inflation year over year is unchanged at 1   everyone has a theory as to how to stop it finally in february 2019 there 's a change   prices in january 2019 were the same as in january 2018   zero inflation   everyone takes credit for bringing down inflation

loan officer here yes you pay the per diem i 'd recommend not paying it off for like 6 months you can pay it down to basically nothing and then hold it for six months and pay it off better for credit if it 's a simple interest rate most car loans are multiply the current principal balance by the interest rate and divide it by 365 that 's the per diem or daily interest for example 10,000 dollar auto loan at 3 10000 300 so each day the balance is 10k the loan cost 82 cents so in a month your first payment is 100 dollars goes to interest goes to principal then the new principal is so the next month another 30 days with the new per diem of the 100 payment is in principal in interest and so on

if you have a lump sum you could put it into a low risk investment which should also have low fluctuations right away to avoid the risk of buying at a down point   then move it into a higher risk investment over a period of time   that way you 'll buy more units when the price is lower than when it 's higher usually i hear dollar cost averaging applied to the practice of purchasing a fixed dollar amount of an investment every week or month right out of your salary   the effect is pretty minimal though except on the highest growth portfolios and is generally just used as a sales tool by investment councilors in my opinion

if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate you can always make money buy it when it 's cheaper and sell it when it 's more expensive if you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently then you do n't know what it will do next most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first   but you do n't know when they 'll move lower or higher   so how could you figure out if you 'll make money you ca n't know dca will on average make you better off unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes but it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases this is true of many investment disciplines such as rebalancing they are all based on averages   if the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using dca but when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day you 'd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day no way to know in advance   degree of volatility should n't matter any fluctuation is enough for dca or rebalancing to get you ahead though it 's true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger since there 's then more difference between dca and a lump purchase   i think the real reason to do dca and rebalancing is risk control they reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day and they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant

i 'm not an expert by any means but pretty much every source i 've seen says that one year is far too short for any sort of real investment   most guides suggest that anything less than 3 5 years should stay in no risk accounts like savings or cds   if you need to be sure you get all of the money back after just one year any sort of market based investment e.g. stocks or bonds is too risky one option is to buy i bonds   you can buy up to $ 10,000 worth in a calendar year and 12 months is the minimum holding period   the advantage of i bonds is that the interest rate is indexed to inflation so that roughly speaking they can not lose value in real dollars   right now they pay per year which is substantially better than you 're likely to get with a savings account or 12-month cd   this would come to $ if you buy $ 10k of i bonds if you sell before holding them for five years which you will under your plan you forfeit the last 3 months worth of interest   even so your effective rate will likely be better than a savings account or cd   also you could get 12 months worth of interest if you 're able to buy them slightly early and/or postpone your sabbatical slightly so that you hold them for 15 months your other option is to find the best rate you can in a cd or savings account   nerdwallet for instance suggests you could get between 1 and 1.1 for a $ 10k deposit in a 1-year cd which would be about $ 100 as you can see either way your money is not going to grow that much   you 'll be gaining somewhere in the ballpark of a couple hundred dollars at most   there just is n't a way to earn more than that in one year without some risk of losing principal i 'm assuming based on your texas flag pic that you live in the usa   to buy i bonds you must be a us citizen resident or government employee

it depends on many factors but generally the bid ask spread will give you an idea there are typically two ways to buy or sell a security with a limit order you would place a buy for 100 shares at $ then it 's easy in the worst case you will get your 100 shares at $ 30 each exactly you may get lucky and have the price fall then you will pay less than $ 30 of course if the price immediately goes up to say $ 35 nobody will sell at the $ 30 you want so your broker will happily sit on his hands and rake in the commission while waiting on what is now a hail mary ask with a market order you have the problem you mention the ticker says $ 30 but say after you buy the first 5 shares at $ 30 the price shoots up and the rest are $ 32 each you have now paid on average $ per share this could happen because there is a limit order for 5 at $ 30 and 200 at $ 32 you would have filled only part of that 200 you would be able to see these in the order book sometimes shown as bid ask spread or market depth however the order book is not law just because there 's an ask for 10k shares at $ 35 each for your $ 30 x stock does n't mean that by the time the price comes up to $ 35 the offer will still be up the guy or algorithm who put it up may see the price going up and decide he now wants $ 40 each for his 10k shares also people are n't obligated to put in their order maybe there 's a trader who intends to trade a large volume when the price hits a certain level like a limit order but he elected to not put in a limit order and instead watch the ticker and react in real time then you will see a huge order suddenly come in out of nowhere so while the order book is informative what you are asking is actually fundamentally impossible to know fully unless you can read the minds of every interested trader as others said in normal securities meaning traded at a major exchange especially those in the s&p500 you simply ca n't move the price the market is too deep you would need millions of dollars to budge the price and if you had that much money you would n't be asking here on a qa site you would have a professional financial advisor or even a team that specializes in distributing your large transaction over a longer time to minimize the effect on the market with stocks such as otc and especially worthless penny stocks with market caps of $ 1 mil or less what you say is a real problem you can end up paying multiples of the last ticker if not careful and you do have to be careful about it which is why you should n't trade penny stocks unless you know what you 're doing and if you 're asking this question here you do n't

john 's answer is great the question however is complex enough that one can write a book on the topic   so i 'll take the liberty to add two observations the matched 401(k should be the priority even before paying off one 's credit cards if any a dollar for dollar match combined with the extra years of compounding is worth a bit longer on the debt pay off to a younger person the roth either roth 401(k or ira is a good choice while you are in a lower tax bracket i recommend you look at the page at fairmark to understand the tax brackets it 's easy to see how many people straddle that 15 line at $ 68 k taxable and with a bit of planning using roth while in the 15 bracket and deductible accounts as you go above you can tax manage your affairs to avoid the higher rates

use with moderation powerful stuff your caller could be an offshore scammer too summarizing from you can dispute the debt and demand that the collector give you the name and address of the original creditor and show that it is n't past the statute of limitations if they ca n't validate the debt by providing that info in writing they must drop it until they can do so you can sue though generally not for very much if they do n't you may have to make this request in writing so it has a paper trail a valid verification respond must include if they do n't respond within 30 days they are in violation of the fair credit reporting act fdcpa section and you can send registered mail threatening them with a lawsuit if they do n't immediately drop it and remove it from your credit report they should respond to that within two weeks and if they do n't have darned good evidence will probably cave if they can prove you do owe the money well you can hope they are n't licensed to collect in your state if they are n't you can try to challenge them on that basis unlikely to work if they agree remember to send a copy of the letter to the credit reporting agencies to make sure it 's taken off your record if this is n't enough to resolve it you 'll probably need to bring suit that 's another long list of steps i 'm going to refer you to the linked site rather than summarize them here since at that point you should get a lawyer involved to make sure it 's done promptly

if you look around online and read about credit scores you 'll find all kinds of information about what you should do to maximize your credit score   however in my opinion it just is n't worth rearranging your life just to try to achieve some arbitrary score   if you pay your bills on time and are regularly using a credit card your score will take care of itself yes you can cut up the card you do n't like and keep the credit card account open   the bank may close your account at some point in the future because of a lack of activity but if they do do n't worry about it   you have other accounts that you are using   personally i do n't like having open credit accounts that i 'm not using i close accounts when i 'm done with them   i realize that it goes against everything that you will read but my score is very high and my oldest open credit card account is 2 years old   do n't let them scare you into credit activity that you do n't want just to try to win at the credit score

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

in the case of reward cards different cards may offer different rewards for different kind of purchases for example in the uk one of the amex cards offers 1.25 cashback on all purchases whereas one of the santander cards offers 3 on fuel 2 or 1 on certain other transactions and nothing on others of course you then have to remember to use the right card another reason is that a person may use a card for a while build up a good credit limit and then move to a different card perhaps because it has better rewards or a lower interest rate etc without cancelling the first if it costs nothing to keep the first card then it can be useful to have it as a spare

so child your goal is to make money this is usually achieved by selling goods say lemonade at a price that exceeds their cost say sugar water and well lemons options at first are very much same in that you can buy the right to engage in a specific future trade you make money in this situation if the eventual returns from the scheduled trade cover the cost of purchasing the option otherwise you can simply opt out of the trade you purchased the right to trade after all not any type of obligation makes sense good because what follows is what makes options a little different that is if you sell that same right to engage in a specific trade the situation is seemingly reversed you lock in your return at the outset but the costs are n't fully realized until the trade is either consumed or declined by the owner of the option and keep in mind that it is always the owner of the option who is in the driver 's seat they may sell the option hold on to it and do nothing or use it to engage in the anticipated trade and that 's really all there 's to it

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

many a time even if the tax is deducted and paid by the company it does not reflect as a credit against your pan for various reasons like you not submitting it to your employer in time errors of reconciliation etc its advisable that you inform your company finance officer that you have received such a letter q1 the sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report this was set up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your pan and the tax deducted against your pan it shows if the tax was tds and which employer paid it or if this was a self assessment or etc   to view this report there are 2 options   register directly at   follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits note it normally takes 2 3 months to reflect the data   the other alternative is that quite a few leading banks citi sbi etc provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend provided your pan is associated to your account q2 the only details you need to submit are the form 16 this would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the number required for reconciling q3 tds is the liability of the employer however if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect incomplete information give by you then its your liability for example if you change jobs in a year the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference q4 if its established that the company was at fault for not deducting the tax or deducting and not paying it to government on time there are enough provisions to penalize the company including putting the top management team behind bars

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

as always with investments it depends on your risk adversity i do n't want to repeat the content of hundreds of recommendations here so just the nutshell for qualified investments the more risk you are willing to take the more returns you 'll get the upper end is the mutual funds and share market where you have long term expectations of 8 10 and corresponding risks of maybe + 50 per year the lower end is a cd where you can expect little to no interest corresponding to little to no risk investing in shares funds is not better than investing in cds it is different not everybody likes financial roller and some people mainly consider the high risk which gives them sleepless nights while others just consider the expected high long term gains as all that counts find out what your personal risk adversity is and then pick accordingly

you 're in the same situation i 'm in bought new house did n't sell old house now renting out old house assuming that everything is stable right now i 'd do something besides pay down your new mortgage if you pay down the mortgage at your old house that mortgage payment will go away faster than if you paid down the one on the new house   then things start to get fun   you then have a lot more free cash flow available to do whatever you like i 'd tend to do that before searching for other investments   then once you have the free cash flow you can look for other investments probably a wise risk or retire the mortgage on your residence earlier

options both puts and calls are typically written sold at different strike prices for example even though the stock of xyz is currently trading at $ 12.50 there could be put options for prices ranging from $ 0.50 to $ just as an example there are several factors that go into determining the strike prices at which people are willing to write options the writer seller of an option is the person on the other side of the trade that has the opposite opinion of you if you are interested in purchasing a put on a stock to hedge your downside that means the writer seller of the put is betting that you are wrong and that the stock price will rise instead

you are correct that barring an equity capital raise your money does n't actually end up in the company however interest in their stock can help a company in other ways management board members hopefully own shares or options themselves thus knowing that green policies are favorable for the stock price as your fund might buy shares can be quite an incentive for them to go   companies with above average company share performance are also often viewed as financially healthy and so creditors tend to charge lower interest for companies with good share performance   lastly a high share price makes a company difficult to take over as all those shares have to be acquired and at the same time makes it easier for the company to perform takeovers themselves as they can finance such acquisitions by issuing more of their own shares there is also the implication that money flowing towards such green companies is money flowing out of away from polluting companies for these dirty companies the inverse of the previous points can hold true of course on the other hand there is quite an argument to be made that large enough green funds should actually buy substantial positions in companies with poor environmental records and steer the company towards greener policies but that might be a hard sell to investors

usually when a company is performing well both its share price and its dividends will increase over the medium to long term similarly if the company is performing badly both the share price and dividends will fall over time if you want to invest in higher dividend stocks over the medium term you should look for companies that are performing well fundamentally and technically choose companies that are increasing earnings and dividends year after year and with earnings per share greater than dividends per share choose companies with share prices increasing over time uptrending then once you have purchased your portfolio of high dividend stocks place a trailing stop loss on them for a timeframe of 1 to 3 years i would choose a trailing stop loss of 20 this means that if the share price continues going up you keep benefiting from the dividends and increasing share price but if the share price drops by 20 below the recent high then you get automatically taken out of that stock leaving your emotions out of it this will ensure your capital is protected over your investment timeframe and that you will profit from both capital growth and rising dividends from your portfolio

it is not right to force people to buy any product or service period do you see how wrong this is i 'd wager that you and i both agree that getting health insurance is a responsible thing to do ok good but i do not agree that anyone should be forced to buy anything this is tyranny   regardless of what is responsible or not the government or anyone else for that matter has no right to force you to buy anything just for the simple fact that you breathe air obama signed into law a tax on all living people with the signing of obamacare so because you 're alive you are slapped with a tax until the day you die it 's a complete this mandate is just one of the terrible things about obamacare imagine what we could be forced to buy next the federal government forcing us to go to college or perhaps the federal government forcing all employers to employ no less than 20 people or maybe they want everyone to buy cable mandating that anyone buy anything is not right in the least and there is much more wrong with obamacare than just the mandate and these other points i made   forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing pe conditions without being able to charge more is another blow to our liberty and freedom when the government mandates that insurance companies must cover pre existing conditions and must do so without charging more you leave the door open for consumers to abuse this system obama effectively gave people the option to get insurance after they get sick without consequence of higher prices that is by definition not insurance and then when that person is no longer sick they can hop off their plan do you understand the economic effect of this this is the reason why insurance premiums are skyrocketing when someone hops on with a pe condition and then hops off during open enrollment that person is paying $ 100 for $ 1,000 worth of medical care my numbers of fictitious but the concept remains the same imagine if you had a business where customers paid a monthly fee of $ 50 so that at any time they may withdraw $ 1,200 when they needed it well the federal government decides to pass a law that says you can not deny people that do n't have a monthly subscription and need immediate financing and now people can come in and give you $ 100 and in return you give them $ 1,000 your business would be an epic fail except you did two things to combat this new law 1 you raised your customers monthly subscriptions from $ 50 to $ 75 and 2 you now require that monthly customers pay a $ 25 deductible before they are allowed to have their $ 1,200 as a business person these changes were necessary because you were not allowed to deny walk in customers that were exchanging their $ 100 for your $ 1,000 this is how obamacare is affecting the insurance market insurance companies have to find a way to not lose money raising premiums and deductibles for paying customers is the only way to do it   in a perfect world everyone buys health insurance before they are sick and despite the fact that we do n't live in a perfect world there were still ways to get health insurance and i 'm talking pre obamacare if you did n't have it before getting sick you could have gotten a job that offered medical coverage in a group insurance plan these plans always covered pe conditions these plans are still required to cover pe conditions   i am not a bad person i 'm not greedy either i believe in social support system for those that truly need it sometimes people are born into bad situations or sometimes people can slip up and hit some bad luck i am more than fine with helping those people out but when the government puts their hands too deep into my pockets it is n't just money they are grabbing i spend over 40 hours a week at a job that job is where i obviously make my money time is money and so when the government is constantly creating new welfare programs the government is taking time from my life this is time that i want to spend with my friends wife mother father sister and daughter time is limited for everyone and i want my time outside of my 40 hours at work that is my right that is all of our rights   you know even the crazy socialist bernie sanders says that those people that work 40 hours a week deserve to make a living wage well if companies were n't regulated so much we 'd sure as hell have more money in our pockets less government regulations means more competition more availability more choices and better prices look at the grocery store industry i do n't know the proper industry term we have shop rite acme whole foods publix wegmans 's costco traders joe 's and so many more look at how stocked our supermarket shelves are all the time the only shortages that ever happen are when forecasts call for and all the ice melt is gone other than that shelves are stocked food is fresh and prices are excellent and you do n't have just one brand of sliced bread or a single brand of peanut butter or regular butter or lettuce or soup meats on and on and on you have many brands for many products we have 13 different kinds of milk in our grocery stores milk soy milk whole milk 1 2 organic milk organic 1 the government did n't do any of this people did smart hard working people did this there is a market of consumers that want that stuff and people made business to supply the demand this is how things work this is why we are the greatest country on this planet in the history of this world   running water in your home central air life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy being able to turn on

this is really two questions about yield and contents content as others have noted an annuity is a contractual obligation not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se the primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much risk reward you are sharing in generally speaking the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average duration of the payments however you can ascertain the assets that back that promise by looking at for example the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm that is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations a number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm yield as to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate there are at least several reasons i am assuming an immediate annuity 1 return of principal the 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year not the rate of return being earned by the issuer if you invest $ 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return you have $ 105   however the annuity 's issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment as they do n't return your principal when you eventually die because of this they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market what makes a ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others but lie to you by telling you it 's still in your account 2 the time value of money a promise to pay you $ 500 tomorrow costs less than $ 500 today a fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year this can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get the longer you live the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation in short the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation it is not a real rate of return in other words if you give me $ 500 today and i promise to pay you $ 100 for the next 5 years i am making money not only because i can invest the money between now and then but also because $ 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today with annuities if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation you have to pay more for that a lot more these are the two main reasons here are a few smaller ones 3 a very long time horizon if the stock market or another asset class is performing well poorly the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term 4 big boy investing a large financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual can not such as in very large or illiquid assets such as a private company a la warren buffet 5 efficiencies of scale institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals which i wo n't discuss in detail here however they exist large issuers are also often in related business insurance mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if i want to buy facebook and you want to sell it they can just move the stock around without doing any trading with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual hope that helps

many of the above comments are correct about illiquidity   if someone needs to trade at a time of low liquidity for instance when the markets are closed the bid ask spread can often be large to induce someone to trade at odd times   especially as the broker bank on the other side of the trade ca n't immediately go to the market to close out the risk as they often prefer to do in this case the jump is actually is large but not that large ~4   note this trade price is near the close price on the day before the system i use shows a trade that evening for 5 shares near the price on the graph   if you called me after i was done with work and tried to buy 5 shares i 'd quote you a bad price too

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

it looks like you need a lot more education on the subject i suggest you pick up a book on investing and portfolio management to get a first idea dividend yields are currently way below 5 on blue chips unlike coupons from fixed income instruments which in the same risk category pay a lot less dividend yields are not guaranteed and neither is the invested principal amount   in either case your calculation is far away from reality   sure there are investments such as the mentioned direct investments in companies or in emerging economies that can potentially earn you two digit percentage returns just remember risk always goes both ways a higher earning potential means higher loss potential also a direct investment is a lot less liquid than an investment on a publicly quoted high turnover market place if you suddenly need money you really do n't want to be pressed to sell real estate in an emerging market keyword bid ask spread my advice the money that you can set aside for the long term 10 years plus invest it in stock etfs globally everything else should be invested in bond funds or even deposits depending on when you will need the access as others have pointed out consider getting professional advice

yes the really good weed requires a bit of know how to grow properly but i have known and hung out with people that grow plants and i have been to their houses and they have shown me how they trim and clip things and they show me how they put a light to trick the plant into thinking that it is still daylight out etc   but in the end weed ai nt worth what is being charged for it   no way   i am in texas now and the price here is similar to what i paid at the weed club in california in cali i paid a of ten dollars per gram and it was possible to spend approx forty dollars per gram and i think that they even had some that was more than that   but i want to promise you that your average joe can figure out how to get his plants growing just fine especially when all he has to do is to trim and water it as opposed to having to give some criminal ten dollars for enough to make a couple of cigarettes joints of it   paying for weed   and just for the record i do nt really give a why people pay for cigarettes   cigarettes are just plain retarded

this is a great answer   it 's worth noting that often internal charging is commonly an issue in less clear cut situations like it departments charging for their services there is much less of an real value that they could charge for their services to the outside world as it is an internal service not a physical product that is relatively liquid yet their chargeable costs gets inflated and can slow down businesses by making projects seem more expensive than they are i would describe that as one of the most common gripes   also i 'd argue that your latter scenario where profits are shifted around to reduce tax bills is well understood by the top of the business and unlikely to create a situation where divisions are mistakenly regarded as unprofitable unless the cfo fd is missing from all the board meetings it 's a situation that is carefully designed by the business

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

i asked a friend and he gave me a good explanation so i 'm just gon na paste it here for others there is a simple and a complex answer depending on how much you want to understand the pricing dynamic of options   leaps do n't react 1:1 with a stock move because the probability of your option being in the money at expiry is still very much up in the air so you basically do n't get full credit for a move in the stock this far out from expiry the more complex answer involves a discussion of option greeks   delta gamma theta vega and are variables that affect the pricing of all options   the key greek in this case is delta because it describes mathematically the expected move of an option as a ratio vs changes in stock price   for put options the ratio is -1 to 0 where -1 is direct correlation between stock price and option price and 0 is no correlation   the delta increases as an option gets deeper in the money and also as it gets closer to expiry and reflects the probability of the option expiring in the money   for your option contract the current delta is   so = 1.9 which is close   also keep in mind that that strike price had a last trade at when the stock was at and the current ask price is so the last price is n't a true reflection of the market value    as for the other greeks gamma is a reflection of volatility in the sense that it affects the rate of change of delta as price and time changes   theta is the value of the time component of the option and is expressed as the expected time decay per day   the problem is that the time premium is really some arbitrary number that the market maker seems to be able to change at will without justification and it can fluctuate wildly over short periods of time and i think this may explain some of the discrepancy    if you bought the options when aapl was $ a couple weeks ago option price of $ and now aapl is at $ and the delta over that time averaged at then your expected option price would be $ $ $ 0.55 + = $ so you lost around $ in time premium or theta burn over the last 2 weeks assuming it opens trading around 22.1 on monday your broker should have information about the option contract greeks somewhere   for my platform i have to put the over top of the option contract for it to show me the greeks   if your broker does n't have this then you can get it from this is another reason that i only invest in deep in the money leaps because the time premium is much much lower than near the money and also because delta is much higher so if i want to trade out of it early i do n't feel like i 'm getting ripped off not getting paid for a stock price move   for example look at the jan 17 175 put   the delta is and the time premium is only $ 0 1 depending if you are looking at the bid or ask   the only downside is expected returns are lower for deep in the money contracts and they are expensive to buy

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

there are a couple of reasons that a person might choose to use insurance even if they could handle the financial loss if something went wrong they know their risk better than the insurance company while it might seem odd at first glance that an individual can be better at assessing risk than a large company with thousands of actuaries there are limits to the amount of knowledge that an insurance company can have or use to price their insurance products for instance if you were a very aggressive driver but did n't have any recent tickets or accidents because you were in college and did n't have a car on a regular basis but now you have a job and drive 30 miles to work every day you know your risk is relatively high but the insurance company sees you as relatively low risk and are n't able to price that extra risk into your premium just because a person can survive financial after losing something like a car or a house does n't mean it is n't desirable to pay a small price to mitigate that risk if you are using your savings to pay for an emergency then that money needs to be semi liquid in case you need it limiting your investment options where as if you purchase insurance you pay a small amount of money to be able to invest the rest of your money liquidity is a big deal particularly if you are a small business and investing into your business where your money can make your more money but you may or may not be able to access that money very easily

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a    rental house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold forever is a long time of the options you listed the only one guaranteed to generate returns is a bank account the returns may well be very small but absent an economy wide financial failure you will get the stated return land does n't always retain its value nor do rental houses or fields gold clearly fluctuates but you would be better served to think about goals and how you can attain them what do you want to do with the returns if you are trying to set yourself up for purchasing a home paying for college or retirement then the small returns on a bank account may be insufficient and in that case you might be better served by worrying more about the size of the returns you need than the certainty of them there may be many better investments if you more clearly define what you expect to achieve by your investment

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

lol to be fair our monetary system is money is created out of thin air because mainly 3 institutions trade debt around i get the basics but also have no clue what some concepts actually mean   like the national debt its growing does that even matter its not like anyone is going to call that debt in and collapse the whole global system or the big one so the government doubles the money supply in 2008 but we did n't have run away inflation that does not make any sense its all imaginary the only sense there is to make is that some rich s are now richer

no cash is necessary for most people   in the modern day in the us there is no need to keep paper currency around for emergencies any sort of emergency that knocked out all of the ability to use plastic atms credit cards etc for an extended period of time and knocked your bank out of service would be of the level that cash   might not have any value either your $ 100 of cash for natural disasters is likely more than enough and even that i would n't necessarily consider a vital thing in this day where even a major natural disaster probably is n't going to have too much impact on the financial sector outside of the immediate area that you should be exiting quickly   keep however much cash around that you need for day to day cash expenses and that should be enough the level of emergency that would suggest cash being needed would probably need more than you 'd actually want to keep around anyway i.e. a complete collapse of the american or world financial system would imply you need months worth of cash   that 's just not feasible nor is it practical financially   you should have your emergency fund making at least a bit of interest 1 or so is n't hard to get right now and in the near future that may increase substantially if interest rates go up it also would make you a substantial theft target if it were known you had months worth of cash around the house i.e. thousands of dollars   do n't necessarily give you sufficient protection unless you 've got a very good safe commercial ones are only as safe as the ability to crack them and/or transport them is now if you find yourself regularly out at 2 am and run out of cash and you live somewhere that atms do n't exist and you find yourself needing to pay cab drivers from time to time after a drunk then i 'd keep at least one cab 's worth of cash at home

just looking at your question i can tell it 's not worth it financially even if you did n't borrow the money to do it at your current rate you 'll be making in 5 years which is roughly a growth of 2.5 per year   if you go for the masters in 5 years you 'll be making with roughly the same growth rate 2.5 so it 's costing you $ 70,000 the cost of school plus the 2 years of reduced income to raise your salary by $ 1,300   the payback period would be about 25 years   it would be much worse if you borrowed the money to do it not a chance

i 'd say you have a couple options that differ by the amount of time required option 1 export your checking credit card ledgers from your banks for the unaccounted for periods you mention then import them into gnucash   they wo n't be categorized but it 's a fairly simple task to go through and categorize the main ones   anything else can be categorized in an unaccounted for account and either properly categorized over time at a later date or just left unaccounted for option 2 make one entry in each of your liabilities and assets that is also part of the unaccounted for expense account but contains the number required to balance your accounts now   this is by far the easiest and will allow you to start with a clean slate now but keep your prior records in the same ledger    option 3 start a new ledger with the same account expense structure as your previous ledger   from here on out you 'd open this gnucash file and start fresh   also quick and easy but there is no way to look at the old ledger and run reports unless you open that separately   i actually do this every couple of years as a way to force me to clear out obsolete accounts and trim the fat since gnucash can take a long time to open when the ledger contains many years of transactions

the biotechnology sector as a whole is a popular buy recommendation among some analysts these days for a few reasons   some analysts feel that the high costs in r&d even without much profit are a positive sign for growth because it means a company is working towards finding the next blockbuster drug or the next class of such drugs there have n't been many new classes of blockbuster drugs since the development of 's and and many of the new drugs that have been developed have been tweaks to existing classes of drugs some analysts feel that it 's about time for a new class of blockbuster drugs to hit the market a new blockbuster drug means significant profits for the company that develops it a new class of blockbuster drugs means significant profits for the whole industry   since about 2009 the food and drug administration has been more lenient in its approval of new drugs this wave of new approvals has reduced r&d costs for companies because they do n't need to go back to the lab or earlier phases of clinical trials and continually tweak their drugs in order to gain approval this has also made some analysts optimistic genetic engineering is considered an up and coming field with potentially significant applications to the pharmaceutical industry advances in this field may increase profits for the industry but since biotech companies are often the ones producing the engineering equipment research etc such advances could be a major source of revenue for the entire biotech industry   in the us and in the developed world as a whole the elderly population is growing and since people consume more medicine as they grow older this could lead to higher profits for companies involved in the production of pharmaceuticals which includes biotech companies of course in the long run   in the us the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act expanded insurance coverage which gives more people the means to afford pharmaceuticals also in general people consume more healthcare services when they have insurance this is called moral hazard so some analysts expect that the expansion of insurance coverage will only lead to more profits for the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology firms in general the global food crisis as the climate changes companies like monsanto which use various forms of genetic engineering to produce crop strains that can survive in increasingly hostile environments look more and more appealing to places that need crops designed to grow in such environments any methods that could increase yields look increasingly popular and biotechnology companies often market such methods as a side note i know monsanto is a contentious example and there are a lot of misconceptions about genetically modified food and the genetic engineering methods they do so i wo n't get into a debate about that   in general technology is a popular subject right now i 've read analyst reports from analysts that clearly do n't follow the biotech sector that base their forecasts for the biotech sector on the activities of companies like dell zynga hp linkedin facebook etc clearly it 's problematic when an analyst sees the word technology and automatically assumes that the biotech sector is responsive to the same factors as social media firms hardware manufacturers etc this is n't to say that the biotech sector is completely isolated from this but when i read a report that talks about facebook 's ipo being bad news for companies like gilead sciences without mentioning upcoming fda decisions about gilead 's products or any biotech specific factors i 'm not convinced the analyst has performed due diligence   i keep using the phrase some analysts because i want to stress that the opinions stated above are n't universal although they 're popular not everyone is so optimistic also i do n't want you to see these reasons and think that i 'm making a buy recommendation because i 'm not i 'm not making a recommendation one way or another   i 'm happy to clarify my answer too i follow the biotechnology sector extensively if you want to get a rough feel for the daily movements of the sector as a whole a good place to start is ibb the ishares nasdaq biotechnology index fund the four largest holdings are gilead sciences and which are all big players in the industry obviously these are a little different from the big name pharma companies like pfizer etc but they 're still considered pharma companies it 's also worthwhile to follow the fda press announcements by the time the news is published there it 's probably already leaked or known to people in the industry the biotech sectors are rife with accusations of insider trading so you might not find trading opportunities but it 's important to get familiar with the information the releases contain if you want to know more about the industry volatility trades are always popular trades around fda drug approvals

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

the first step i would do is determine the asset class mixture for your current portfolio and the mixture for your new one if they are the same and all you are doing is changing the funds that you use to invest in that mixture of asset class then just do the change all at once in this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes   if you are also changing your asset class mixture then it depends on how large the change is i would still do the whole change at once but if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps i would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix

actually you 're missing the key feature of cdos   most cdos use much to our economic misery ultimately a system call   to simplify this idea i 'll make a two example   suppose i buy mortgages covering a face value of $   because they are subprime if i just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them at least investors who are safety oriented   what i do is divide them into two tranches   one bond issue is for $ 100,000,000 and another for $   the idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue   i 'll probably keep these bonds the lower   thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed $   then the rating agencies rate the first issue aaa and it gets snapped up by investors   in a strict sense it is basically the entire $ backs up the first bond issue in reality many cdos had multiple tranches with the lowest being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings

i fell into a similar situation as you   i spent a lot of time trying to understand this and the instructions leave a lot to be desired   what follows is my ultimate decisions and my rationale   my taxes have already been filed so i will let you know if i get audited 1   so in cases like this i try to understand the intent   in this case section iii is trying to understand if pre tax money was added to your hsa that you were not entitled too   as you describe this does not apply to you   i would think you should be ok not including section iii i did n't however i am not a tax lawyer or even a lawyer    2 i do not believe these are medical distributions from the 8889 doc    qualified hsa distribution    this is a distribution from a health flexible spending arrangement fsa or health reimbursement arrangement that is contributed by your employer directly to your hsa this is a one time distribution from any of these arrangements the distribution is treated as a rollover contribution to the hsa and is subject to the testing period rules shown below see pub 969 for more information    so i do n't think you have anything to report here    3 as you have no excess this line can just be zero    4 from the 8889 doc this is a distribution from your traditional ira or roth ira to your hsa in a direct trustee to trustee transfer    again i do n't think this applies to you so you can enter zero 5 this one is the easiest   you can always get this money tax free if you use it for qualified medical expenses from the 8889    distributions from an hsa used exclusively to pay qualified medical expenses of the account beneficiary spouse or dependents are from gross income see the line 15 instructions for information on medical expenses of dependents not claimed on your return you can receive distributions from an hsa even if you are not currently eligible to have contributions made to the hsa however any part of a distribution not used to pay qualified medical expenses is includible in gross income and is subject to an additional 20 tax unless an exception applies    i hope this helps

what i think you 're really confused   is the baby boomers   all of the policies that were put in place that led up to first the .com bubble and then the housing bubble took place in the late 80s and through the 90s most of gen x was somewhere between their late 20s early 30s for the oldest and elementary school for the youngest born in the small percentage of that group that was even out of school during those years was very likely in their first few years on the job even while the events eventually 2000 2008 most of gen x was still either in school or in their first few years on the job the very oldest of them was around 40 and finally at a point where they could start being considered as middle managers   only now in 2012 are we finally starting to see the bulk of the power starting to shift as the baby boomers finally begin to retire and gen x starts taking their place in all actuality the collapse in 2008 could turn out to be the line in the sand where the boomer rule ended and gen x took over in 15 years if things have gotten worse then we can all get back together and blame gen x but as far as the mess we 're in currently that 's the boomers

there 's nothing to rebalance the index fund rebalances itself to continue matching the index however you need to understand that such an investment is not diversified and you only invest in a very specific market and very specific stocks on that market s&p 500 is large 500 different companies most of the time but still not as broadly diversified as your retirement investment portfolio should be you should talk to a financial adviser cfp for example many companies provide access to these for 401k plan participants but in any case i 'd suggest considering target date funds funds that are investing based on your expected retirement year and become more conservative as you get closer to that year

generally speaking   1 take the position size average daily volume   2 multiply that number by 10 or whatever of volume you think you can execute you can at best acct for 10 percent of traded volume on a day   3 you now have days until liquidation x   4 take the days until liquidation sample the return over   time x. i.e. if days until liquidation is 10 you would sample 10 day returns   5 calculate the distribution characteristics of this window mean var skew and calculate var based on some confidence   you can now have a liquidity risk expected loss and a   if position is on margin do n't forget to add the interest cost   note instead of taking 10 day return you can take the 10 day vwap and calculate return between open and 10 day vwap

if you are a novice investor and want to diversify i 'd recommend looking into targeted mutual funds they could n't be easier you just put your money in the fund with the year that you anticipating needing to take the money out and the fund manager handles diversification and adjusting the risk appropriately over the life of the fund based on the remaining time horizon the only downside is that the annual expenses tend to be higher on these than if you just invested in the underlying securities funds but you are pretty much paying them to manage it for you

there is no single market interest rate there are myriad interest rates that vary by risk profile term corporate bonds are typically riskier than bank deposits and therefore pay a higher effective rate when the market for that bond is in equilibrium than a bank account does if you are willing to accept a higher risk in order gain a higher return you might choose bonds over bank deposits if you want an even higher return and can accept even higher risk you might turn to stocks over bonds if you want still higher return and can bear the still higher risk derivatives may be more appealing than stocks

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

look at a mixture of low fee index funds low fee bond funds and cds the exact allocation has to be tailored to your appetite for risk if you only want to park the money with essentially no risk of loss then you need fdic insured products like cds or a money market account as opposed to a money market fund which is not fdic insured however as others have said interest rates are awful now   since you are in your early 30 's and expect to keep this investment for 10 + years you can probably tolerate a bit of risk also considering speaking to a tax professional to determine the specific tax benefits drawbacks of one investment strategy funds and cds versus another e.g. real estate

based on what you wrote you would be better off with no position to start and then enter a buy stop 10 above the market and a sell stop 10 below the market both to open positions depending on which way the market moves if the market does n't move that 10 you stay flat however a long option straddle position requires that the market moves significantly one way or the other just so you recover the premium that you paid for the straddle if the market does n't move you will lose money on your straddle due to theta decay and a drop in volatility alternatively you could buy a strangle with a call strike 10 out and a put strike 10 out the premiums would be much much lower and these take the place of the stop entries personally i would never buy a straddle but i do sometimes sell them especially when implied volatility is very high

there are tax free bonds in the united states   they are for things like public housing and other urban projects   they are tax free for everyone but only rich people buy them   why    the issue is that the tax free nature of the bond is included in its yield   so rather than yielding say a 5 return they figure that the owner is getting 20 off due to not paying taxes   as a result they only give a 4 return but are as risky as a 5 return investment   net result only rich people invest in tax free bonds   rich is defined here to mean people paying a 20 tax on long term investment returns    or take the state and local tax salt deduction which has been in the news recently   again it is technically open to everyone   but there is also a standard deduction that is open to everyone   for the typical family state and local taxes might be 5 of income   so for a family making $ 100k a year that 's $ 5k   the same family can take a $ 13k or so standard deduction instead of itemizing   so why would they take the smaller deduction    as a practical matter two groups take the salt deduction   people rich enough to pay more than $ 13k in state and local taxes and people who also take the mortgage interest deduction   so it helps a lot of people who are rich quite a bit   and it helps a few middle class people some    but if you are lower middle class with a $ 30k mortgage on a tiny house and paying 4 interest then that 's only $ 1200 a year   add in property taxes of $ 3000 and salt of $ and that 's only $ 7k   even if the person gives $ 3k to charity the $ 13k deduction is a lot better and requires less paperwork    contrast that with someone who has $ 500k mortgage at 3.6 interest   that 's $ 18k in interest alone   add in a salt of $ 7k and property taxes of $ 50k and there 's $ 75k of itemized deductions much better than $ 13k   now a $ 7k donation to charity is entirely deductible   and even after the mortgage interest deduction goes away the other $ remains

yes the interest rate on a treasury does change as market rates change through changes in the price but once you purchase the instrument the rate you get is locked in the cashflows on a treasury are fixed so if the market rate increase the present value of those future cashflows decreases so the price of the treasury decreases if you buy the bond after this happens you would pay a lower price for the same fixed cashflows hence you will receive a higher rate note that once you purchase the treasury instrument your returns are locked in and guaranteed as others have mentioned also note that you should distinguish between treasury bills and treasury bonds which you seem to use interchangeably straight from the horse 's mouth treasury bills are short term securities with maturity up to a year treasury notes are medium term securities with maturity between 1 and 10 years and treasury bonds are anything over 10 years

you should check this with a tax accountant or tax preparation expert but i encountered a similar situation in canada your isa income does count as income in a foreign country and it is not tax exempt the tax exemption is only because the british government specifically says so you would need to declare the income to the foreign government who would almost certainly charge you tax on it there are a couple of reasons why you should probably keep the funds in the isa especially if you are looking to return first contribution limits are per year so if you took the money out now you would have to use future contribution room to put it back second almost all uk savings accounts deduct tax at source and its frankly a pain to get it back leaving the money in an isa saves you that hassle or the equal hassle of transferring it to an offshore account

if an item costs £ 10 excluding vat and you buy it from a vat registered company you will have to pay £ 12 you sell it for any price you like and you do n't add vat   let 's say you set the price at £ 15 and sell 1000 items for £ 15 you take £ 15,000 you spent £ 12,000 you make £ 3,000 profit in your pocket and you 'll pay taxes according to your profits £ 3,000 it does n't really matter that vat was involved it just affects the price that you pay   if you mostly trade with private customers and not with companies being not vat registered is a good idea since by not having to add vat you can keep your prices lower it 's different if you trade mostly with vat registered companies in that example if private customers are willing to pay £ 15 but not more if you were vat registered you could n't just charge £ 15 + vat = £ 18 because your customers would stop buying so you 'd have to charge £ 12.50 + vat = £ 15 and make less money   but if you sell to a company it does n't make a difference to them if they pay £ 15 without vat or £ 15 + vat = £ 18 you have to send the vat to hmrc but you can subtract the £ 2,000 that you paid yourself so you make £ 2,000 more profit

please do n't waste any more time feeling bad for merchants for the charges they incur i do n't know who supported the lobby for this rule but issuers no longer can demand that merchants accept all transactions even the unprofitable ones   i discussed this at length on my blog merchants accept credit cards for one reason and one reason only it brings them more business   more people will buy and on average they 'll buy more   they used to take the occasional hit for someone buying a pack of gum with a credit card but they do n't have to anymore   the new law restricts issuers from imposing minimum transactions that are less than $ 10 i use a rewards card wherever possible   i get a cheaper price   in most cases i do n't care what the merchant has to pay   they 've already factored it into their prices but if you are concerned then as fennec points out in his comment cash is the way to go

if you 're looking for a purely financial answer ignoring the social environmental aspects there are a few different ways you can look at it for these types of improvements the simplest is a payback calculation   how long would it take you to recoup the initial costs    for example if the entire installation cost $ 5,000 including any tax credits and you save $ 100 per month i 'm making both numbers up you 'll pay back your investment in 50 months or about 4 years    note that if you borrow money to do the improvement then your payback period is longer because you 're reducing the amount that you 're saving each month by paying interest if you 're deciding between different uses for the money like investing or paying down other debt then you can look at the return that you 're getting   using the same example you are spending $ 5,000 and getting $ 100 per month back for a 24 annual return $ 1,200 $ 5,000 which is better than you can get on almost anything but a 401(k match meaning do n't stop your 401(k contributions to do this either the decision on whether or wait or not then becomes will the price drop faster than the amount of savings you will realize   so if you will save $ 100 per month in your electric bill is the price of the complete installation going down by more than $ 100 each month   if not you 'd be better off buying now and start paying back the investment sooner

anything can be insured for the right price this product is offered for devices at higher risk which would be logical purpose of owner needing coverage for a specific length of time typically this would be a type of adverse selection but targets customers that typically would not require insurance on their device but as you said they may be traveling and putting their devices at added risk like all insurance companies their loss ratio losses premiums will depend on the law of large numbers and spread of risk as we know the majority of the time trips are taken electronics make it back home safely like many tech companies their advantage over conventional insurers is likely low overhead costs being on a mobile platform they likely have a fraction of the claims handling cost of a conventional insurer payments are likely automated by linking bank accounts so there is little transaction cost burden on this company in short their operation is likely highly automated with few staff and low expenses allowing them to take on a higher loss ratio than conventional insurers and still leave room for profit without having ever used this service i can tell you they likely price in anticipated fraud the same way walmart prices in inventory loss into their prices i personally would share your concern that it 'd be difficult to combat fraud on such a platform especially with no claims whom are typically the first line of defense again i answer this never having used their service but i work as an analyst at a large insurer and these would be my assumptions based on what i know of

imagine a $ 1,000 face value bond paying 10 interest semi annually that means every 6 months there is $ 50 being paid now if the price of that bond doubled to $ 2,000 what is the yield it is still paying $ 50 every 6 months but now sports a 5 yield as the price went up a great deal similarly if the price of the bond was cut in half to $ 500 now it is yielding 20 because it is still paying out the $ 50 every 6 months the dollar figure is fixed what percentage of the price it is can vary and that is why there is the inverse relationship between prices and yields note that the length of the bond is n't mentioned here where while usually longer bonds will have higher yields there can be inverted yield curves as well as calls on some bonds also inflation indexed and convertible bonds could have different calculations used as principal adjustments or possible conversion to stock can change a perception on the overall return

heres what you need to know this can be prevented by what a previous renter did to us this is a smart kind of a way to do it but its very smart as long as your property is worth it raise the rent higher you must have a very nice clean everything working house you must be willing to have anything fixed this is all to make up the high rent you do n't want the rent way out of proportion but just a bit higher this is because more than likely people who are going to pay for a higher rent do n't usually leave a mess higher class families vs lower class people living alone what might also help from the risk of damage is create a fee also what my renter did of any painting needed done like finger prints on the wall nails in the wall carpet stains etc when the tenant is ready to move out i would suggest a required professional carpet cleaning as well when lease is up my renter was very nice but very strict and did all these things he has a few properties that are very nice middle class houses your home sounds like it could easily pass for this kind of business depending on where you live if the tenant leaves before his lease is up you could charge a 1 2 month 's rent to be able to find a new tenant be proactive on finding a tenant before the lease is up   this would be a bit of work to first set up and usually maintain but its a good thing to think about

see my comment for some discussion of why one might choose an identical fund over an etf   as to why someone would choose the higher cost fund in this instance the admiral shares version of the fund vfiax has the same expense ratio as the etf but has a minimum investment of $ 10k.   some investors may want to eventually own the admiral shares fund but do not yet have $ 10k.   if they begin with the investor shares now and then convert to admiral later that conversion will be a non taxable event   if however they start with etf shares now and then sell them later to buy the fund that sale will be a taxable event vanguard etfs are only commission free to vanguard clients using vanguard brokerage services   some investors using other brokers may face all sorts of penalties for purchasing third party etfs   some retirement plan participants either at vanguard or another broker may not even be allowed to purchase etfs

why would someone invest in other instruments e.g. stocks to pay for    childrens college education when the capital gains on those are    taxed unlike a home equity loan many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans roth iras series ee and i bonds tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is possible if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a roth ira   a house is collateral for a home equity line of credit   a combination of unfortunate events could cause someone to default on the loan and loose their residence also the tax advantages of 529 plans and roth iras are not applicable to purchase a motor boat   with respect some people like to leave the home equity loan untapped for other uses more details 529 plans are not taxed by on the federal level when the withdraws are used for college   in many states contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level   these are not self directed so you ca n't trade stocks bonds in a 529 plan however certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today 's prices if you want a self directed ability to trade stocks bonds vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education consider a roth ira there are yearly contribution limits and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses also i believe interest revenue from series ee and i bonds is tax free if the bond is used for education there are special conditions and situations to 529 plans roth iras series ee and i bonds the purpose of this answer was to expand upon the tax advantageous vehicles for higher education

getting the first year right for any rental property is key it is even more complex when you rent a room or rent via a service like airbnb. get professional tax advice for you the irs rules are covered in tax topic renting residential and vacation property and irs pub residential rental property there is a special rule if you use a dwelling unit as a personal    residence and rent it for fewer than 15 days in this case do not    report any of the rental income and do not deduct any expenses as    rental expenses if you reach that reporting threshold the irs will now expect you to to have to report the income and address the items such as depreciation when you go to sell the house you will again have to address depreciation all of this adds complexity to your tax situation the best advice is to make sure that in a tax year you do n't cross that threshold when you have a house that is part personal residence and part rental property some parts of the tax code become complex you will have to divide all the expenses mortgage property tax insurance and split it between the two uses you will also have to take that rental portion of the property and depreciation it you will need to determine the value of the property before the split and then determine the value of the rental portion at the time of the split from then on you will follow the irs regulations for depreciation of the rental portion until you either convert it back to non rental or sell the property   when the property is sold the portion of the sales price will be associated with the rental property and you will need to determine if the rental property is sold for a profit or a loss you will also have to recapture the depreciation it is possible that one portion of the property could show a loss and the other part of the property a gain depending on house prices over the decades you can expect that airbnb will collect tax info and send it to the irs as a us company we ’re required by us law to collect taxpayer    information from hosts who appear to have us sourced income virginia will piggyback onto the irs rules local law must be researched because they may limit what type of rentals are allowed local law could be state or county city town even zoning regulations could apply also check any documents from your home owners association they may address running a business or renting a property   you may need to adjust your insurance policy regarding having tenants you may also want to look at insurance to protect you if a renter is injured

no virtually ever item in the cpi is adjusted using hedonics which by definition can only be used to lower inflation not adjust it up   hedonics is not necessarily bad but it does n't actually reflect inflation it reflects standard of living vs. purchasing power which is not useful for a purely monetary measure   it also does not correctly reflect that despite the fact that a 1970 's 20 tv can not from an economic standpoint be directly compared to a 2012 20 tv if the price is the same adjusted for inflation inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20 tv which is what the definition of inflation is   so no i do n't think you 're correct on this this is also kind of glossing over the fact that the cpi essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation

what is your time horizon over long horizons you absolutely want to minimise the expense ratio a seemingly 2 fee p.a can cost you a third of your savings over 35 years over short horizons the cost of trading in and trading out might matter more a mutual fund might be front loaded i.e. charge a fixed initial percentage when you first purchase it etfs traded daily on an exchange just like a stock do n't have that what you 'll pay there is the broker commission and the bid ask spread and possibly any premium discount the etf has vis a vis the underlying asset value   another thing to keep in mind is tracking error how closely does the fond mirror the underlying index it attempts to track more often than not it works against you however not sure there is a systematic difference between etfs and funds there size and age of a fund can matter indeed i 've had new and smallish etfs that did n't take off close down so i had to sell and re allocate the money two more minor aspects synthetic etfs and lending to short sellers 1 some etfs are synthetic that is they do n't buy all the underlying shares replicating the index actually owning the shares instead they put the money in the bank and enter a swap with a counter party typically an investment bank that promises to pay them the equivalent return of holding that share portfolio in this case you have implicit credit exposure to that counter party if the index performs well and they do n't pay up well tough luck the etf was relying on that swap never really held the shares comprising the index and wo n't necessarily cough up the difference 2 in a similar vein some non synthetic etfs hold the shares but then lend them out to short sellers earning extra money this will increase the profit of the etf provider and potentially decrease your expense ratio if they pass some of the profit on or charge lower fees so that 's a good thing in case of an operational screw up or if the short seller ca n't fulfil their obligations to return the shares there is a risk of a loss   these two considerations are not really a factor in normal times except in improving etf expense ratios but during the 2009 meltdown they were floated as things to consider mutual funds and etfs re invest or pay out dividends for a given mutual fund you might be able to choose while etfs typically are of one type or the other not sure how tax treatment differs there though sorry not something i have to deal with in my jurisdiction   as a rule of thumb though as alex says for a popular index etfs will be cheaper over the long term very low cost mutual funds such as vanguard might be competitive though

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

gt how did you make the transition up the ladder thus far   i applied online for jobs that were above and beyond what i was currently doing and did well enough in the interviews to get hired for my current position i found the hiring manager online and emailed him directly to tell him i was the person he was looking for but i do n't think that approach will get me any further     gt;how is your linkedin connection with executive recruiters   i do n't have one i know that 's an important next step but i 'm not sure how to do it do i just email a bunch and introduce myself i expect to be in my current position for at least 2 more years realistically 4 and i would like to start the relationships but i 'm not sure what to do    i think that getting on some boards would be a similar step but again i 'm not sure how    gt;would you be willing to take a salary cut for a title change   within reason maybe 10    your college have a program for networking with alumni   probably i have a pair of masters degrees in my field from a program the issue is that the alumni i network with would need to be executives and they 're harder to engage

to me it looks pretty good 10 per year is a pretty good return lagging behind the indexes is normal it is hard to beat the indexes over a long period of time the longer the period the lesser the chances to succeed however half a year is a relatively short period of time and you should check your investments a little bit deeper i 'm assuming you 're not invested in one thing so you should check per investment how it is performing if you have funds check each fund against the relevant index for that fund if you have stocks check against the relevant industry indexes etc also check the fees you pay to each fund and the plan they come out of your pocket lowering the return

i think the key thing is flexibility the money is not tied in with the offset mortgage if you find a better investment you can always take some of it out and put it towards that instead once it matures if there is nothing good to reinvest in then it can go back into the offset mortgage once you have had money in the offset account even if you take it out you have already saved money on your mortgage right now you would be pressed to find an instant access isa with a rate higher than 1.5 so if you need immediate access then the offset account seems good on the other hand for retirement you might be saving longer term and then you can get an isa rate of 3 currently which may be better for a part of the money or perhaps the upcoming lifetime isa with 25 yearly bonus may make sense for part of the money if you do not need easy access to all of it as dilip says this assumes you want safe investments

i had a colleague turn down a raise once because he believed that female colleagues were already being paid well below his salary and it was unfair to further increase this gap for very public figures raises are often declined as a form of leadership showing that management is willing to forgo bonuses and salary increases as a form of solidarity with the employee population   some leaders forgo a salary altogether or take a $ salary

based on the information you gave there are dozens if not hundreds of possible theories one could spin about the rental market sure it 's possible that there are no listings because rental units on this street are quickly snapped up on the other hand it 's also possible that there are no listings because almost all the buildings on the street have been abandoned and aside from this one property that someone is tying to sell you the rest of the street is only by wild dogs and/or drug dealers or maybe the street is mostly owner occupied i.e. the properties are not being rented to anyone or maybe it 's a commercial district or maybe craigslist is n't popular with people who own property on this street for whatever reason maybe syracuse has a city ordinance that says property must be advertised in the newspaper and not on websites for all i know or maybe you missed it because nobody in syracuse calls it housing for rent they all call it apartments for rent or houses for rent or some local phrase or or or before i bought a property i 'd do more research than one search on one web site have you visited the property i do n't know how much you 're preparing to invest i have no idea what property prices are in syracuse but i 'd guess it 's at least tens of thousands of dollars surely worth making the drive to syracuse to check it out before buying

this is lan investment analyst at betterment to answer your question american investors are drawn to use the s&p 500 spy as a benchmark to measure the performance of betterment portfolios particularly because it ’s familiar and it ’s the index always reported in the news however going all in to invest in spy is not a good investment strategy and even using it to compare your own diversified investments is misleading we outline some of the pitfalls of this approach in this article why the s&p 500 is a bad benchmark an algo advisor service like betterment is a preferable approach and provides a number of advantages over simply investing in etfs spy or others like voo or ivv that track the s&p 500   so why invest with betterment rather than in the s&p 500 let ’s first look at the issue of diversification spy only exposes investors to stocks in the u.s. large cap market this may feel acceptable because of home bias which is the tendency to invest disproportionately in domestic equities relative to foreign equities regardless of their home country   however investing in one geography and one asset class is riskier than global diversification because inflation risk exchange rate risk and interest rate risk will likely affect all u.s. stocks to a similar degree in the event of a u.s. downturn in contrast a well diversified portfolio invests in a balance between bonds and stocks and the ratio of bonds to stocks is dependent upon the investment horizon as well as the individual 's goals   by constructing a portfolio from stock and bond etfs across the world betterment reduces your portfolio ’s sensitivity to swings and the diversification goes beyond mere asset class and geography for example betterment ’s basket of bond etfs have varying durations e.g. short term treasuries have an effective duration of less than six months vs. u.s. corporate bonds which have an effective duration of just more than 8 years and credit quality the level of diversification further helps you manage risk   dan betterment ’s director of behavioral finance and investing examined the increase in returns by moving from a u.s only portfolio to a globally diversified portfolio on a risk adjusted basis the betterment portfolio has historically outperformed a simple diy investor portfolio by as much as 1.8 per year attributed solely to diversification    now let ’s assume that the investor at hand investor a is a sophisticated investor who understands the importance of diversification additionally let ’s assume that he understands the optimal allocation for his age risk appetite and investment horizon investor a will still benefit from investing with betterment   automating his portfolio management with betterment helps to insulate investor a from the or the tendency for investors to sacrifice returns due to bad timing studies show that individual investors lose on average anywhere between 1.2 to 4.3 due to the behavior gap and this gap can be as high as 6.5 for the most active investors compared to the average investor betterment customers have a behavior gap that is 1.25 lower how betterment has implemented smart design to discourage market timing and short sighted decision making   for example betterment ’s tax impact preview feature allows users to view the tax hit of a withdrawal or allocation change before a decision is made currently betterment is the only automated investment service to offer this capability this function allows you to see a detailed estimate of the expected gains or losses broken down by short- and long term making it possible for investors to make better decisions about whether short term gains should be deferred to the long term now for the sake of comparison let ’s assume that we have an even more sophisticated investor investor b who understands the pitfalls of the behavior gap and is somehow able to avoid it betterment is still a better tool for investor b because it offers a suite of tax efficient features including tax loss harvesting smarter cost basis accounting municipal bonds smart dividend reinvesting and more each of these strategies can be automatically deployed inside the portfolio investor b need not do a thing each of these strategies can boost returns by lowering tax exposure to return to your initial question why not simply invest in the s&p 500 investing is a long term proposition particularly when saving for retirement or other goals with a time horizon of several decades to be a successful long term investor means employing the core principles of diversification tax management and behavior management while the s&p might look like a investment one year there are always reversals of fortune the goal with long term passive investing the kind of investing that betterment offers is to help you reach your investing goals as efficiently as possible    lastly betterment offers best in industry advice about where to save and how much to save for no fee

i would say you should invest in the market that is more convenient for you bearing in mind that if you buy adrs you may have some things to keep an eye on depending on certain events as mentioned by duffbeer703 so if you are investing with an account in the u.s. go with the adrs as that will avoid some currency conversion hassles and possible exchange rate issues   i am not certain but i have a feeling that would also make it easier for you to keep the taxman happy
