to be absolutely sure you should call the agent and check that said i have been renting accommodation through both agencies and directly through landlords for seven years i live in london and this is quite a common situation it normally means that the deposit is being securely held by a third party so that it can not be taken or depleted without the agreement of both parties the deposit protection scheme is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner as a third party they will have different account details it may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly this means that your deposit goes to the agency 's account and the rent goes to the landlord 's account obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts a little colour to your day i am currently paying my rent to the agency who also took the deposit but because of the way they handle deposits versus rent the deposit was sent to a different account held by the same agent in my previous flat i paid the deposit to an agency and the rent directly to the landlord this resulted in an issue one time where i got the two accounts confused and paid rent to the agency who after giving me a small slap on the wrist transferred it to my landlord in the flat before that i paid rent and the deposit to my landlords holding company that is one of the few times that i paid rent and the deposit into the same account again check with the agent that one of these situations is the case but this is absolutely normal when renting through an agency

we change it every so often to reduce fraud this is idiocy they receive regular payments they are asking the people who pay them to regularly change where their money is being sent this increases their exposure to fraud dramatically as each time the account is changed there is a risk it will be changed to an account they do not control this is a huge red flag confirm that this is authentic and if so insist that they sign an agreement accepting all liability for the risks this crazy policy causes otherwise you should refuse to go through the effort of confirming new accounts and risking typing or communication errors on a regular basis this is definitely a what were they thinking kind of thing if it 's not fake entirely this answer assumes that you were given a correct explanation that they change it regularly believing that will reduce fraud

we change it every so often to reduce fraud if you 're absolutely sure you did n't just send money to a scammer a landlord this has nothing to do with they 're playing a game with you by changing the account number frequently it makes it more likely you make a mistake in entering the payment account when they come back to you a few days past due saying we never received your rent you 'll eventually realize it got sent to the wrong account now you owe them late fees and there 's really nothing you can do about you did not in fact pay them on time you sent it to the wrong account it 's an easy way for them to collect an additional few thousand dollars a year anytime a small business or landlord says they have to do something weird to reduce fraud chances are it 's a pretense to you getting hosed in some way

couple of my friends went through a fraud agent who ran off with their money and the landlords were none the wiser so it always pays to be a bit diligent are they a well known letting agents nationally   many agents do have different accounts to manage their properties yours seems a case as such probably i.e. they manage the property on behalf of the landlord so keeping their monies differentiated did you sign an agreement if yes go through what is written in the agreement most of it is same in all agreements but have a look anyway check if there is mention of deposit protection scheme one thing you could do is go to a bank to do the transfer the same bank where the letting agent holds their account and confirm from them if it is really a personal account or a business account i am not sure how possible it is but does n't hurt to ask if it is a personal account then fraud is the most possible cause the sort code should tell you which branch and which bank or the best option is to ask the estate agents to show a recent statement of the bank account where the money is to be deposited into some tips

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

realistically fair is whatever you all mutually agree upon some people can do means based splits some people ca n't my recommendation is to split things evenly based on actual used space or usage do you have a with similarly sized rooms break it up by room so in this case your gf and you pay 50 and the other person pays 50 maybe there 's a garage or one br is bigger i 've seen splits not 50 50 based on these factors you may consider paying a third all around for rent but i would try to avoid solutions that are not usage based if you do n't and try for a means based split best case scenario is nothing really is different but the worst case scenario is setting yourself up to be taken advantage of because you are effectively subsidizing other people this often changes relationships not always but often frankly the best option here is to find a place that is more affordable for everyone trying to make it so that your gf and roommate are not going to be in a difficult financial place by living with you it resolves all the problems here

this is a clear example of annuities where you are trying to find net present value npv to find a quick solution you can use the excel function = npv solving it without excel is slightly more complicated you have to use the annuities formula   payment rate 1   this formula can be written in many different ways this is one of the simplest   so how do we translate that to your problem for the first option 1 ^ 2 = if you have n't made this years 5000 payment you have to subtract this years 5000 so option 1 would equal   option 2 is similar 1 ^ 10 = wait you also have to subtract the initial cost so option 2 is   so in essence option 1 is better but you will have to buy a machine sooner or later   part 2 discount rate = 12 is for you to understand the importance of high rates in long periods of time like option 2 's 10 years     edit for clearer formulas also made a mistake calculating option 2

all investors of equal standing get the same proportion of the net assets on bankruptcy but not all shareholders are of equal standing in general once all liabilities are covered bond holders are paid first as that type of investment is company debt then preferred stock holders are paid out and then common shareholders this is the reason why preferred stock is usually cheaper it is less risky as it has a higher claim to assets and therefore commands a lower risk premium the exact payout schedule is very corporation dependent so needs research on a per firm basis

when you can your option depends on your trading style in the american options trading style the most popular you 're allowed to your options and make profit if any whenever you want before the expiration date thus the decision of   exercising your option and make a profit out of it does not rely only on the asset price the reason is you already paid for the premium to get the option so if taken into account the underlying price and your premium your investment is profitable then you can your contract anytime

in many countries giving something free to the employee is considered a taxable income equivalent and taxes have to be paid on it as it can not be assigned to specific employees the company pays a flat tax on it so it actually costs the company more also not all employees value it equally or consider it as a part of their income so reducing the salary accordingly would not be considered ok by many employees as a result the company can only do it as an additional offer which is too expensive for small businesses

but the flat would be occupied all the time famous last words are you prepared to have a tenant move in and stop paying rent in the us it can take 6 months to get a tenant out of the apartment and little chance of collecting back rent i do n't know how your laws work but here they do not favor the landlord   the tiny sub 1 profit you make while funding principal payments is a risky proposition it seems to me that even normal repairs heater appliances etc will put you to the negative   on the other hand if this property has bottomed in terms of price and it rises in value you may have a nice profit but if you are just renting it out it feels like it 's too close to call   by the way if you can go with a 30yr fixed i 'd suggest that this would get you to a better cash flow sooner a shorter mortgage simply means more money to principal each month   edit as far as equity goes at the beginning it seems the equity build up is really from your pocket definitely so by switching from the 30 to the 15 what is your goal the assumption i may have made is you wish to be a real estate investor with multiple properties doing so means saving up for the next down payment given the payoff time even if the property ran a high profit i imagine you 'd want to focus on cash flow minimize the monthly expense maximize what you can take each month to save for the next down payment it 's your choice years from now to have one paid property or 3 properties each with that 30 down payment and let time be your friend

here is some good advice read your prospectus   it seems to hold 20 of it 's value $ out of $ 3b via of the apr 21st 2015 contracts   expiring in 30 days    those will be rolled very quickly into the may contracts at a significant loss of nav based on current oil futures chains    meaning if crude oil stays exactly the same price you 'd still lose 1 5 spread loss .20 the percentage of nav based off futures contracts on the roll each month    their other $ is held in swaptions or cash unsure how to rate that exposure   all i know is those contracts are in contango danger during roll week for the next few months imo   i wonder if there is a website that tracks inflows and outflows to see if they match up with before and after the roll periods how oil etfs work many oil etfs invest in oil futures contracts an oil futures contract is a commitment to buy a given amount of crude oil at a given price on a particular date in the future since the purpose of oil etfs is only to serve as an investment vehicle to track the price of oil the creators of the fund have no interest in stockpiling actual oil therefore oil etfs such as uso periodically roll over their futures contracts by selling the contracts that are approaching expiration and buying contracts that expire farther into the future the contango problem while this process of continually rolling over futures contracts may seem like a great way to track the price of crude oil there ’s a practical problem with the method contango the rollover method would work perfectly if oil funds could sell their expiring contracts for the exact same price that they pay for the futures contracts they buy each month however in reality it ’s often true that oil futures contracts get more expensive the farther their expiration date is in the future that means that every time the oil etfs roll over their contracts they lose the difference in value between the contracts they sell and the contracts they buy that ’s why funds like uso which invests only in wti light sweet crude oil futures contracts do n’t directly track the performance of the wti crude oil spot price due to these reasons i 'd deem for swing trading not for investing buy and hold   maybe later i 'll remember why one should n't buy and hold leveraged vehicles leverage slippage decay     do you have an exit price in mind or are you buy and hold

first if it is in any way a joint account the debt usually goes to the surviving person assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets for example full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate non cash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin if after that the deceased has any assets at all there is usually varies by state a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid this is handled by the estate there is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive then pay as many as possible based on the priority and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty this sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts then disperse remaining assets to next of kin if there are no assets held by just the deceased as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate tell them there is no estate then forget about them a lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate which is not simple or cheap but also note that you can negotiate and sometimes get them to accept less if there are assets when my mother died the doctors treating her zeroed her accounts the hospitals accepted a much reduced total but the credit cards wanted 100

stock prices are set by bidding in principle a seller will say i want $ 80 if he ca n't find anyone willing to buy at that price he 'll either decide not to sell after all or he 'll lower his price likewise a buyer will say i 'll pay $ 70 if he ca n't find anyone willing to pay that price he 'll either decide not to buy or he 'll increase his price for most stocks there are many buyers and many sellers all the time so there 's a constant the typical small investor has very little control of the price you say i want to buy 10 shares of xyz corporation and my maximum price is $ 20 if the current trending price is below $ 20 your broker will buy it for you if not he wo n't you normally have some time limit on the order so if the price falls within your range within that time period your broker will buy that is your choice is basically to buy or not buy or sell or not sell at the current price you have little opportunity to really negotiate a better price if you have a significant percentage of a company 's total stock different story in real life most stocks are being traded constantly so buyers and sellers both have a pretty good idea of the current price if the last sale was ten minutes ago for $ 20 it 's unlikely anyone 's going to now bid $ 100 they 're going to bid $ or $ or some such if the last sale was for $ 20 and your broker really came to the floor and offered to buy for $ 100 i suppose someone would sell to him very quickly before he realized what an outrageous price this was i use td ameritrade and on their web site if i give a price limit on a buy that 's more than a small percentage above the last sale they reject it as an error i forget the exact number but they wo n't even accept a bid of $ 80 if the stock is going for $ 40 they might accept $ 41 or $ 42 something like that

a somewhat provocative but not proposal rent do n't buy a house to live in in the thing that got many people in deep trouble is their mortgage it 's not a productive investment but a speculative bet on what was in fact a bubble and a class of assets that is notoriously slow to recover after a slump before thinking about your savings or buying into silly ideas about gold you should realise that as a middle class worker the biggest risk after a crisis is losing your job renting your accommodation means being able to downgrade or move very quickly and not being forced to sell a house at the worse possible time if you really do need to liquidate some of your investments at a bad time having a more diversified portfolio means that you are not losing everything to meet some short term obligations assuming you 're in the us this means forgoing some nice tax advantages that might be too tempting to resist i 'm not so i am basing this on what i read on this site but bubbles aside there is nothing that makes real estate a particularly good investment as such especially if you also live in the house you 're buying you might very well come out on top but you expose yourself to several risks and are less prepared to face a crisis

so you are in it that is great news because you can earn a fabulous income   the part time is not great but you can use this to your advantage   you can get another job or three to boost your income in the short term   in the long term   you should be able to find a better paying job fairly easily    there is one way to never deal with creditors again   never borrow money again   its pretty damn simple and from the suggestions of your post you do n't seem to be very good at handling credit   this would make you fairly normal   78 of   us households do n't have $ 1000 saved   how are they going to handle a brake job broken dryer emergency room visit   those things happen cut your lifestyle to nothing earn money and save it   say you have 2000 saved up   then a creditor calls saying you owe 5k.   tell me you are willing to settle for the 2 k you have saved   if they do n't hang up   if they are willing getting it writing and pay by a method that insulates you from further charges    boom one out of the way and keep going   you will be for some income but it is a easy way to earn extra money    this will all work if you commit yourself to never again borrowing money

it is different this time but i think the risk of asset prices rising is almost as equal as them falling qe caused asset price inflation but qe was only to calm support the market they 're probably not going to stuff that qe money back into the central bank for a very long time either maybe they 'll just keep rolling over the bonds out to maturity while relying on deficits to inflate away the assets at the fed     my bet is the main risks going forward are political risks and continued modest inflation among things not measured by cpi

make sure you shop around and ask a lot of places for a good faith estimate   last i knew the good faith document is the same everywhere and long form that makes it easy enough to compare the hard numbers from place to place   i have gotten several estimates for various scenarios and i have had them hand written and printed   i discounted the hand written ones because that broker seemed pretty disorganized in general learn the terms online and start comparing   use the good as a negotiation tool to get lower rates or lower costs from other brokers   see how accurate the person is at listening to you and filling out the paperwork   see how responsive they are to you when you call with questions and want some changes check with at least four places the more places you shop the better idea you will have of what fees are high and what interest rates are low   i might pay a higher fee to get a lower interest rate so there are lots of trade offs to consider

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

you have interpreted the instructions correctly the issue with two jobs at the same time is that that second job will be taxed at the highest rate but the second employer has no idea what the other position is paying you   if you make enough to be in the 15 tax bracket for your main job that means some of the money from each paycheck is   taxed zero some is taxed at 10 and the last dollars are taxed at 15 but the second job should withhold for taxes to cover all the income at 15 to avoid problems you should look at the tax form you are filling out this year look at the total tax you paid not the refund or the amount you owed when you filed but your total tax paid the government allows a safe harbor if you make sure that in 2016 you have the same amount withheld this calendar year if that is n't enough you will owe money in april 2017 but you will not have to pay a penalty after you have a couple of paycheck from your main employer check to see that if you work the rest of the year at that same rate that the federal withholding will make the safe harbor if you will make it   you do n't have to worry about the penalty if you will fall short adjust the w-4 accordingly

it was the sole creditor we 're trying to avoid here is what i meant to say not the broker him herself   the reason a firm might extend their debt would be to extend their credit into monetary value in the scenario i just discussed and it would more often be the more well known firms that would be the most likely to provide a bond money supply think ibm bonds google bonds cheese board collective bonds tesla motor bonds ge bonds etc   all these firms would find a way to apply their bond funds in a way that would expand their output and make repaying the bonds much more likely just like a normal firm would today   the only difference is that in the mean time that bond becomes a monetary commodity which people can trade for goods and services until it is repaid once repaid people can see that the bond is worth using and the demand for that bond as money will increase just like how the demand for money will increase and that prompts a normal central bank to print more money   which means the firm is safe to take on stable debt again which people can reuse again   the major difference here is that we have a money supply that you can choose to participate in or not and it is up to the consumers of that currency how the money supply flows as opposed to a central authority   it does matter who 's first in line to get the new money in any economy and with multiple policies competing power is less concentrated

can i give the bank the $ 300,000 to clear the mortgage or must i pay off the total interest that was agreed upon for the 30 year term this depends on the loan agreement   i had one loan where i was on the hook regardless   early payment was just that early payment   it would have allowed me to skip months without making payments because i had already made them    most loans charge interest on the remaining balance if you pay early it reduces your balance decreasing the interest   if you pay it off early there 's no more balance and no more interest    i 'm curious why the bank would let you do this since they will lose out on a lot of profit but they have their money back and can loan it out again   if they maintained the loan they are n't guaranteed of getting their money    interest is rent that you pay for the loan of the money   once you return the money why pay more rent   while some apartment leases require paying through the entire term most allow for early termination with proper notice   you give back the apartment the landlord rents it out again   why should they get paid two rents    another issue is that if someone with a mortgage switches jobs to a new location that person will likely prefer to sell the current house and buy one in the new location   this is actually the typical way for a mortgage to end   if the bank did not allow that they would essentially force the family to rent out the mortgaged house and rent a new house   so the bank would go from an owner occupied house that the inhabitants want to keep maintained to a rental where the inhabitants only care to the extent of their legal liability    consider the possibility that the homeowners lose one of their jobs   they ca n't afford the house   so they sell it and close out the mortgage   should the bank refuse to allow the sale and attempt to recover the interest from the impoverished homeowners   that situation would almost guarantee an expensive foreclosure    once there is any early termination clause for any reason it makes sense for the bank to structure the loan to include the possibility   that way they do n't have to investigate whatever excuse is involved   loan regulators may require this as well particularly on mortgages

generally to be able to write off worthless securities you need to show that they 're indeed worthless it 's not necessarily easy as you need to prove that there 's no way they will regain any value in the future what is usually done instead is very simple you sell them many brokers are aware of this problem and will assist by buying these securities from you at a nominal price e*trade for example for $ 0.01 scottrade for $ 0.00 and providing a proper trade confirmation this is a bona fide sale so if the stock does regain value it will be a profit for the broker in this case you just report it as a sale at loss check with your broker if they support such a solution

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

without going into minor details an fx transaction works essentially like this let 's assume you have sek 100 on your account if you buy 100 usd rub at 1.00 then that transaction creates a positive cash balance on your account of usd 100 and a negative cash balance an overdraft of rub 100 so right after the transaction assuming there is not transaction cost the net equity of your account is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 100 = 100 sek let 's say that the day after the rub has gone down by 10 and the rub 100 is now worth sek 90 only your new equity is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 90 = 110 sek and you 've made 10 congrats had you instead bought 100 sek rub the result would have been the same assuming the usd sek rate constant in practice the usd sek rate would probably not be constant and you would need to also account for in your example the usd rub has gone up 10 but the rub has gone down hence the result you find in my example the rub has gone down 10 i.e. the usd has gone up 11

why do people take out life insurance on their children they do so largely because it 's being sold to them   the insurance companies generally push them on the basis that if you have to pay for a funeral and burial the cost would devastate a family 's finances   in some rare instances that might actually be true but not generally should i take out a policy on my child generally no   when they sell you a policy they have to dance around a catch-22 if you have enough money to afford the cheap life insurance then you have enough money to pay for a funeral and burial that 's probably not going to happen   if you do n't have enough money to pay those expenses in the rare case that a child does die then you really ca n't afford the insurance even if it 's only pennies a day for peace of mind and why would schools send these home to parents year after year   the schools are paid a commission   it is not much more than a fundraiser for them just like school pictures am i missing something yes in fact you could be making money hand over fist if you were willing to prey on parental   just set up a stand outside the hospital and get parents who are just about to deliver to sign up for your amazing insurance plan in case the tragic occurs

ca n't vouch for la but property typically is taxed at either the appraised value the most recent purchase price if it was n't worth that much you would n't have paid that much or some combination of the two usually highest of the two to prevent $ 1 and other goods and services from lowering the tax to zero you have now explicitly paid a total of $ 125k for the property the fact that you bought it in two stages should n't be relevant but should and law are only tangentially connected i 'd recommend asking a tax accountant who know your local practices unless someone here can give you an authoritative answer

this is because short term debt needs to be rolled over to finance the long term project and so when interest rates rise they will be refinanced at a higher interest rate this means that it will end up costing more than if the company had taken out a long term loan at the lower rate a long term project implies that the beneficial incoming cashflows will be long term but with short term financing the debt will come payable sooner which is why it needs rolling over any beneficial cashflows are not   enough to cover the debt

this is a vanguard specific difference in the sense that in the us vanguard is a leader in lowering management fees for the mutual funds   that they offer of course several us mutual fund companies have also been lowering the expense ratio of their mutual funds in recent years because more and   more investors have been paying attention to this particular performance parameter and opting for funds that have low expense ratios but many us funds have not reduced their expense ratios very much and continue to have expense ratios of 1 or even higher   for example american funds developing world growth and income fund charges a 1.39 expense ratio while their 2060 retirement fund charges the funds also have a 5.75 sales charge capital opportunities fund charges for their class c shares and so on    many funds with high expense ratios and sometimes sales charges as well show up as options in far too many 401(k plans especially 401(k plans of small companies because small companies do not enjoy economies of scale and do not have much negotiating power when dealing with 401(k custodians and administrators

they 're probably talking about flipping houses the conventional wisdom when flipping is to purchase the property with a mortgage or other loan on do the work to it get it listed for re sale promptly this step has varying strategies with a profitable price but one that will make it move have the house sold on or before the first payment would be due this is anywhere from 30 to 60 days the flipper then never has to make a payment on the mortgage or loan the costs of the home are recovered promptly potentially before any loan credit card payments or invoices are due and there is a profit this also assumes that either a 100 loan or some other mechanism is used to address closing costs and fees this model fits the premise of the in that you make money investing in real estate but never have to tie up any of your own money in the process

short answer no it only matters if you want to use covered calls strategies the price of a share is not important some companies make stock splits from time to time so that the price of their shares is more affordable to small investors it is a decision of the company 's board to keep the price high or low more important is the capitalization for these shares if you have lots of money to invest the best is to divide and invest a fixed of your portfolio in each company you choose   the only difference is if you eventually decide to use covered call strategies to have a buy write on google will cost you a lot of money and you will only be able to sell 1 option for every 100 shares bottom line the price is not important capitalization and estimated earnings are hope this answers your question

just came across this news companies moving abroad no substitute corporate tax reform how stop article they make it sound quite straight forward and i do n't think they can be called totalitarian leftists by any stretch   here is the money quote   gt america ’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws the first is the tax rate which at 35 is the highest among the 34 mostly rich country members of the oecd yet it raises less revenue than the oecd average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to nascar race tracks last year these breaks cost $ 150 billion in forgone revenue more than half of what america collected in total corporate taxes gt   gt the second flaw is that america levies tax on a company ’s income no matter where in the world it is earned in contrast every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders here too america ’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home not surprisingly many do not american multinationals have some $ 2 trillion sitting on their foreign balance sheets and growing    it seems clear that the 35 rate is not the driving reason for these huge companies doing inversions that 35 rate should almost certainly be cut down but the loopholes and tax breaks need to stop as a condition of a rate cut    clearly this is not a dead simple issue but i just do n't want to hear the silly argument of oh our poor mega corporations are having to pay the highest taxes in the world when the tax environment in the us is clearly rigged in their favor small and mid sized companies that ca n't afford their own congressman sure are getting fucked though and that makes me sad

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

the market is efficient but it is not perfectly efficient there are entities out there that consistently legitimately and significantly outperform the market because of asymmetric information not necessarily insider trading and their competitive advantage access to data and proprietary highly sophisticated i say this despite most hedge funds performing worse than their respective benchmarks for most people even very smart people it makes a lot of sense to invest in index funds with a reasonable asset allocation based on desired volatility tax situation rebalancing methods etc    the usual example that is cited is rt 's   medallion fund because it has enjoyed quite dramatic returns other groups that have been successful include citadel and soros fund management

if you are downloading the app from legit stores apple store google play then it is fine adidas is indeed running a to get more users download the app and get exclusive shoes that they do n't intend to sell in retail market the adidas strategy seems to make the product exclusive and available only to individuals note you have to be in person and show photo id at the adidas retail outlet pay and pick up the shoes one can only register once per phone number the reservation is random first come first reserved the person on facebook is trying to circumvent this by having quite a few people download the app and book he is then looking at buying this from you not sure what would the price of shoes be and is the 350 eur in addition to the price of the shoes that you need to pay the store i could n't find about paris but there were similar campaigns in us last december why do i have to register in the confirmed app in order to have a    chance to get a reservation through adidas confirmed you need to sign    up in the app if you are able to get a reservation we will use this    information plus your photo id to verify your identity when you pick    up what are the steps to make a reservation    step 1 create an account in the app verify through sms and enable location services and push notifications    step 2 follow on twitter to learn when reservations open    step 3 once the reservation period begins open the app and navigate to a product page to select your size and confirm your reservation you must be located within new york city chicago or los angeles areas to participate    step 4 if you get a reservation within adidas confirmed you will receive a retail location and timeframe for pickup within the app    step 5 go to the designated location to complete purchase and receive product

this is pretty basic question but my head is confused   if you buy a $ 1000 bond with 5 interest rate so it would be $ 1050 at maturity   what does it mean   you will be paid the interest in coupons paid in coupons until it totals $ 50 and at maturity paid $ 1000 in one large single payment you get paid the full value in coupons $ 1050 split by multiple coupons   any other explanations of how a bond works are welcome most of the stuff i could find was about what yield is not how the bond actually works

in the prior pmi discussions here it 's been stated that the bank is not obligated to remove pmi until the mortgage 's natural amortization puts the debt at 78 ltv so paying in advance like this will not automatically remove the pmi   nor will a lump sum payment be certain to move the next payment ahead a year if it 's entered as a principal prepayment the next month 's payment is still due in the world of coupon books if you sent in a year 's payments you 'd not benefit from the interest saved in one year you 'd owe what the amortization table tells you   there 's no free lunch when it comes to mortgages or finance in general this is why we usually caution that one should not be cash poor the day after buying a house best to save 30 put down 20 and have a cushion after the closing

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

someone else might be able to provide more details but generally yes of course   international corporations can pursue debt collection across borders whether or not they do is a matter of convenience rather than law   my understanding is that a company 's ability to report on your credit report is dependent on their membership in equifax usa etc so while most of your credit is country by country international companies or companies with any relationship in other countries can follow you cross border if they find out your new address and report the debt w/ that address   since virtually every major company has some american affiliate i would n't hold my breath that you can escape it indefinitely especially since you do n't already have the debt and have the power to actually pay for the service that you 're using   also this is an incredibly scummy thing to do and no matter how you dress it up as a financial decision it 's just theft would you leave the country without paying your landlord without paying for groceries or other physical goods why is stealing from a telecom company any different

the australian tax office website shows tax rates for individuals based on the income earned in the financial year calculating what you 'll be taxed for instance it show that every dollar you earn up to $ you are not taxed every dollar over that up to $ is taxed at 19 cents and so on example 1 so as an example if your income for the year is $ 25,000 you will be taxed $ working here 's how it 's look if you were doing it in a spreadsheet using the tax rates table on the ato website as a guide   example 2 if you income is $ 50,000 it 'd look like this   withholding your employer is obligated to remove the taxable part from your wage each time your paid they do that using the calculation above   if at the end of the financial year the ato determines that too much as been withheld ie you 've claimed deductions that 've reduce your taxable income to less than what your actual income is that 's when you may be eligible for a refund if your employer did n't withhold enough or you had income from other sources that have n't been taxed already then you may actually need to pay rather than expecting a refund your question if you earn $ in the year and for some reason your employer did withhold tax from your pay say $ 2,000 then yes you 'll get all that $ 2,000 back as a refund since the tax rate for income up to $ is $ 0.00 if you earned $ and your employer withheld $ 2000 you 'd get $ back as a refund $ 2000 you have to pay tax on that $ 1 over $

i wo n't make any assumptions about the source of the money   typically however this can be an emotional time and the most important thing to do is not act if this is an amount of money you have never seen before getting advice from a fee only financial adviser would be my second step   the first step is to breathe and promise yourself you will not make any decisions about this money in the short term   better to have $ 100 k in the bank earning nearly zero interest than to spend it in the wrong way if you have to receive the money before you can meet with an adviser then just open a new savings account at your bank or credit union and put the money in there   it will be safe and sound visit and interview at least three advisers with their guidance think about what your goals are   do you want to invest and grow the money   pay off debt   own a home or new large purchase   these are personal decisions but the adviser might help you think of goals you did n't imagine create a plan and execute it

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

the purpose of a market order is to guarantee that your order gets filled if you try to place a limit order at the bid or ask by the time you enter your order the price might have moved and you might need to keep amending your limit order in order to buy or sell and as such you start chasing the market a market order will guarantee your order gets executed also an important point to consider is that market orders are often used in combination with other orders such as conditional orders for example if you have a stop loss conditional order set at say 10 below your buy price you might want to use a market order to make sure your order gets executed if the price drops 10 and your stop loss gets triggered making sure that you get out of the stock instead of being stuck with a limit order 10 below your buy price whilst the stock keeps falling further

the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy

if you plan to keep this asset for ten years then you can take the of its cost over that time period for simplicity lets treat that as 120 monthly payments so at a purchase price of $ 60,000 you are committing around $ 500 per month not including vehicle maintenance i typically allocate around 20 percent of the purchase price of my vehicles for future maintenance costs since you have the cash to purchase this outright you have an option not afforded to most people this adds for additional consideration here is an example   you purchase a $ 60,000 car and put $ 10,000 down you finance $ 50,000 at over 60 months your total finance cost is $ if you do not miss any payments the question here is can you make more than $ on the $ 50,000 that you would retain in this situation over a five year period i know that i most certainly can and is an excellent example of why i finance my vehicles obviously this all goes out the window if you do not have the credit for top rates   i have also negotiated a vehicle maintenance plan with the dealership at the time of my vehicle purchases most dealerships offer this service the key here is negotiating on my last truck i was able to get an all inclusive maintenance policy for 72 months for 8 of the purchase price your mileage will vary with manufacturer and dealership as described in the comments above it is never beneficial for an individual to lease you end up paying more for the newer models i consider that to be a lifestyle choice as it is most certainly not a sound financial decision

i suggest that you use your own judgement on this you can assign a reasonable percentage since it is impossible to monitor the hours using those assets example 40 personal and 60 for business it 's really your call i also suggest that you should be conservative on valuing the assets record the assets at it 's lowest value this is one of the most difficult scenarios in making your own financial statements you can also use this approach i will record the assets at its original cost then use a higher depreciation rate or double declining method of depreciation if the assets have a depreciation rate of 20 per year useful life of 5 years i will make it 30 the other 10 will add more expense and helps you not to overstate your financial statement you can also use the residual value of the asset but if you do this you should figure out the reliable amount i understand that this is not for tax reporting purposes therefore there 's no harm if you overstate your financial statement and even if you overstate you can still adjust the cost of the asset along the way in the middle of the year or year end you will figure out the cost of the asset if it 's over valued once the financial statement is done

to summarize the money never existed the best example i can give is the housing bubble houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money when people could n't make their payments the house prices crashed   the boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended boom and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes bust   the real question that people should be asking is not where did all the money go but why is money issued by private banks   money is a social invention to facilitate trade should it not be like a public water utility counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized all natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters degrees etc money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest we essentially pay rent on all money that and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created once again at interest this is why economists generally say some inflation is good finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality money is just an iou that requires no such interest payment for it 's issue   interest should be made if a loan is issued against savings but not for the simple issuance of money there should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment you can read more about this from reading about arthur in this way the public controls the value of it 's money not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class   if you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt read the work of it 's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least wealth is subject to the laws of while debt is an invention of the human will debt never rots or with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest nothing in the natural world does this

the person you 're talking to is probably someone in the company they need to convey the message to their bank so you need to explain it to them as if they were 3 year old kids you may be used to swift transactions because that 's how you always get paid but unless the uk firm regularly russian freelancers this is probably the first time ever they have heard of it similarly someone in the local branch of their community bank has probably never heard of it before either in europe they use and are rather uncommon be patient explain the issue and the solution in as many words as you can and suggest them putting you on speaker at the bank so that you could talk directly to the person executing the transaction if you do the same on your side and let the bankers talk directly to each other that would probably be ideal

generally you have 60 days to return funds    if you 've been away money in to a roth ira and an emergency strikes you pull out contributions sufficient to tackle the emergency while leaving at least the earnings in there   you 've never paid taxes on these earnings and the earnings will continue to grow tax free    if you 've been away money in a vanilla taxable account and an emergency strikes you pull out whatever amount to tackle the emergency   you 've been paying taxes on the earnings all along but there 's no paperwork you ca n't replace the money in the roth ira outside the 60 day limit except for some specific same year rules that you should iron out with your custodian but you also have n't lost anything   either way in the event of an emergency the funds are removed from an account but in one case you have n't been paying taxes on gains if you want to go the route of a roth ira wrapper for your emergency fund you should n't be touching the funds for small events tires for your car and the like   if your goal is to juice the tax free nature of the roth ira wrapper for as long as you can then the money for retirement if you never experienced an emergency with the understanding that you may have to gut the account in an emergency that 's fine   if you expect money to routinely come in and out of the account a roth ira is a horrible vehicle

$ for every $ 1000 per year are you kidding me these are usually hidden within the expense ratio of the plan funds but > 1 seems to be quite a lot regardless fund x 1 year return 3 3 year return 6 10 year return 5 what does    that exactly mean this is the average annual rate of return if measured for the last 3 years the average annual rate of return is 6 if measured for 1 year it 's 3 what it means is that out of the last 3 years the last year return was not the best the previous two were much better does that mean that if i hold my mutual funds for 10 years i will get    5 return on it definitely not past performance does n't promise anything for the future it is merely a guidance for you a comparison measure between the funds you can assume that if in the past the fund performed certain way then given the same conditions in the future it will perform the same again but it is in no way a promise or a guarantee of anything since my 401 k plan stinks what are my options if i put my money in a    traditional ira then i lose my pre tax benefits right wrong ira is pre tax as well but the pre tax deduction limits for ira are much lower than for 401k   you can consider investing in the 401k and then rolling over to a ira which will allow better investment options after your update just clearing up the question my current employer has a 401k. most of    the funds have the expense ratio of 1.20 there is no matching    contributions ouch should i convert the 401 k of my old company to traditional ira and    start investing in that instead of investing in the new employer 401 k    plan with high fees you should probably consider rolling over the old company 401k to a traditional ira however it is unrelated to the current employer 's 401k if you 're contributing up to the max to the roth ira you ca n't add any additional contributions to traditional ira on top of that the $ 5000 limit is for both and the agi limitations for roth are higher so you 're likely not able to contribute anything at all to the traditional ira you can contribute to the employer 's 401k you have to consider if the rather high expenses are worth the tax deferral for you

i believe it goes a little something like this during period of inflation all boats rise everyone get 's richer and gain control of more physical assets during periods of depression debts are being called due by those who gave out the loans these few powerful men that ca n't be paid and so foreclosures and the like occur giving the creditors control of the actual physical assets   basically you have to track physical assets instead of financial ones to see how the boom and busts are beneficial to the wealthy

all of this assumes that this relationship is n't as employer employee relationship which would require you to withhold taxes if you send them a small token of appreciation and you are unable to record it as a business expense or some other deductible expense you do n't have to be concerned about how they claim it they decide if they want to risk claiming it was a gift or if they want to record it as an expense even if you say some magic phrase that you think will impress the irs the recipient can still decide declare it as income to have any hope of being able to treat it as a gift they would have to be able to demonstrate that there is a non business relationship   if you can claim it as a business expense or a deductible expense   they will have to also claim it as income because your documentation could point the irs to their lack of documentation   giving them a check or sending the payment electronically will require them to claim it as an income since an audit could require them to explain every line on their bank statements

to avoid i state up front that this answer is applicable to the us europeans asians canadians etc may well have quite different systems and rules you have nothing to worry about if you pay off your credit card statement   in full on the day it is due in timely fashion on the other hand if you routinely carry a balance from month to month or have taken out cash advances then making whatever payment you want to make that month asap will save you more in finance charges than you could ever earn on the money in your savings account but if you pay off each month 's balance in full then read the fine print about when the payment is due very carefully it might say that payments received before 5 pm will be posted the same day or it might say before 3 pm or before 7 pm est or noon pst etc etc etc as joetaxpayer says if you can pay on line with a guaranteed day for the transaction and you do it before any deadline imposed by the credit card company you are fine   my bank allows me to write electronic checks on its website but a paper check is mailed to the credit card company the bank claims that if i specify the due date they will mail the check enough in advance that the credit card company will get it by the due date but do you really trust the usps to deliver your check by noon or whatever besides the bank will put a hold on that money the day that check is cut i have n't bothered to check if the money being held still earns interest or not   in any case the bank all responsibility for the after effects late payment fees finance charges on all purchases etc if that paper check is not received on time and so your credit card account goes to late payment status   oh and my bank also wants a monthly fee for its billpay service any number   of such electronic checks allowed each month the billpay service does include payment electronically to local merchants and utilities that have accounts at the bank and have signed up to receive payments electronically all my credit card companies allow me to use their website to authorize them to collect the payment that i specify from my bank account(s i can choose the day the amount and which of my bank accounts they will collect the money from but i must do this every month very conveniently they show a calendar for choosing the date with the due date marked prominently and as mhoran_psprep 's comment points out the payment can be scheduled well in advance of the date that the payment will actually be made that is i do n't need to worry about being without internet access because of travel and thus being unable to login to the credit card website to make the payment on   the date it is due i can also sign up for autopay which takes amount minimum payment due payment in full whatever i choose   on the date due and this will happen month after month after month   with no further action necessary on my part   with either choice   it is up to the card company to collect money from my account on the day specified and if they mess up they can not charge late payment fees or finance charge on new purchases etc   also unlike   my bank there are no fees for this service it is also worth noting that many people do not like the idea of the credit card company withdrawing money from their bank account and so this option is not to everyone 's taste

i stumbled on the same discrepancy and was puzzled by a significant difference between the two prices on etr and fra for example today is sunday and google shows the following closing prices for dai fra dai etr dai so it looks like there are indeed two different exchanges trading at different prices   now the important value here is the last column volume according to wikipedia the trading on stock exchange is done today exclusively via xetra platform thus the volume on etr dai is much more important than on fra dai   obviously they wikipedia is not 100 accurate i.e. not all trading is done electronically via xetra according to their web page exchange has a specialist trading on frankfurt floor service which has slightly different trading hours   i suspect what google and yahoo show as exchange is this manual trading via a specialist opposed to xetra electronic trading to answer your question the stock you 're having is exactly the same meaning if you bought an etr bmw you can still sell it on fra by calling a fra trading floor specialist which will probably cost you a fee on the other hand for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you should only use etr bmw prices because it is way more liquid and thus better reflect the current market valuation

thanks for the info things are starting to make more sense now for some reason i 've always neglected learning about investments now that i m in a position to invest and am still fairly young i 'm motivated to start learning    as for help with td ameritrade i was looking into index funds as another commenter mentioned that i should on their site and am a little overwhelmed with the options first i 'm looking at mutual funds going to symbol lookup and using type = i 'm assuming that 's the same thing as an index fund but since the language is slightly different i 'm not 100 sure however at that point i need some kind of search for a symbol in order to see any results makes sense but i do nt know where to start looking for good index funds     so my first question is if i find a good mutual fund is it correct to simply go to buy mutual funds and find it from there and if so my second question is how do i find a good mutual fund    my goal is to have my money in something that will likely grow faster than a savings account i do n't mind a little volatility i can afford to lose my investment i 'd plan on leaving my money in the fund for a several years at least    my last question is when investing in these types of funds or please point me in another direction if you think index funds are n't the place for me to start should i be reinvesting in the funds or having them pay out dividends i would assume that reinvesting is the smart choice but i can imagine situations that might change that in order to mitigate risk and as i 've said a few times in this thread including the title i 'm a complete amateur so my assumptions are n't necessarily worth that much    thanks for the help i really appreciate all the info so far

to the best of my knowledge the uk 's online banking systems look purely at the sort code and account number when routing transfers   the name is not cross checked to ensure it matches this is why it 's so easy to transfers if you make an error entering the numbers and inadvertently enter the details for a valid account belonging to the wrong person so in your case so long as you 're sure you have the correct account number and sort code it does n't matter what you put in the name field it 'll end up in the account to which those numbers apply   of course you might as well put your best guess into the name field since it does n't hurt and in the event that something does go wrong it 's backup evidence of your intentions

if this is something you plan to continue doing it would make sense to create it as it 's own business entity and then to get non profit status eg    otherwise i 'm pretty sure you have to think of it as you receiving the money as a sole proprietor and file a couple more tax forms at the end of the year i think it 's a schedule c.   so essentially if you bring in $ 10,000 then you spend that $ 10,000 as legit business expenses for your venture your schedule c would show no profit and would n't pay taxes on it but you do have to file that form operating this way could have legal implications should something happen and you get sued having the proper business entity setup could help in that situation

the stock market is just like any other market but stocks are bought and sold here just like you buy and sell your electronics at the electronics market this is a place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares or stocks or equity no matter what you call it what are these shares   a share is nothing but a portion of ownership of a company suppose a company has 100 shares issued to it and you were sold 10 out of those it literally means you are a 10 owner of the company why do companies sell shares companies sell shares to grow or expand suppose a business is manufacturing or producing and selling goods or services that are high in demand the owners would want to take advantage of it and increase the production of his goods or services and in order to increase production he would need money to buy land or equipment or labor etc now either he could go get a loan by something or he could partner with someone who could give him money in exchange for some portion of the ownership of the company this way the owner gets the money to expand his business and make more profit and the lender gets a portion of profit every time the company makes some now if the owner decides to sell shares rather than getting a loan that 's when the stock market comes into the picture why would a person want to trade stocks first of all please remember that stocks were never meant to be traded you always invest in stocks what 's the difference trading is short term and investing is long term in very simple language it 's the greed of humans which led to this concept of trading stocks a person should only buy stocks if he believes in the business the company is doing and sees the potential of growth back to the question a person would want to buy stocks of the company because how does a stock market help society look around you for the answer to this question let me give you a start and i wish everyone reading this post to add at least one point to the answer corporations in general allow many people come together and invest in a business without fear that their investment will cause them undue liability because shareholders are ultimately not liable for the actions of a corporation the cornerstone north american case of how corporations add value is by allowing many investors to have put money towards the railroads that were built across america and canada for the stock market in particular by making it easier to trade shares of a company once the company sells them the number of people able to conveniently invest grows exponentially this means that someone can buy shares in a company without needing to knock door to door in 5 years trying to find someone to sell to participating in the stock market creates liquidity which is essentially the ease with which stocks are converted into cash high liquidity reduces risk overall and it means that those who want risk because high risk often creates high reward can buy shares and those who want low risk because say they are retiring and do n't have a risk appetite anymore can sell shares

americans do n't actually believe that there are no categories where other countries surpass them   they believe that the unique mix of characteristics the country does have is the best mix available   people who say the united states is the best country in the world are n't saying that every aspect of american life is better than every aspect of life in any other country in the world   they 're saying that they 're willing to trade bad high schools for the best universities that they would rather have a world dominating gdp and a decent per capita than a world dominating gdp per capita alone that they would rather have new york city than hong kong   they 're pointing out that the infant mortality rate between first world countries is essentially equal and that the rankings hide the fact that the differences are negligible   they 're not saying our health care system is better that our public transportation is better or even that our airlines are the most efficient   they 're saying that in the weighted matrix of categories no country gets a better score despite getting high scores in many areas   they 're simply pointing out that their weight factors are different from yours   the anti that is most honest is that of people like the of north korea who say honestly they do n't like america because it is so large and successful and that they hate it when this success is used to further human rights   but the more and dishonest version does n't recognize this and attempts to hold up a straw man that americans who say this is the greatest country on earth are stupid anti who honestly believe that there is n't a single statistic in which america does n't top the world   these americans are imaginary   they do n't exist except in the of jealous or as tiny fringe minorities in counties far removed from economic centers   america is the great experiment of the enlightenment   it was the first country to be ruled by liberal democracy   and it is n't threatened when others join in the wealth generation that the philosophy yields   indeed they celebrate it   they even go too far in trying to spread it

most patterns can be used on various time frames for example you could use candle stick reversal patterns on monthly charts weekly charts daily charts or intra day charts like one hour or even one minute charts obviously if you are looking for longer term positions you would be looking at daily weekly or monthly charts and if you are looking for shorter term positions you would be looking at intra day to daily charts   you can also use a combination of time frames for example if you are trying to enter a trade over a long term uptrend you could use a weekly chart to determine if the stock is currently uptrending and then use a daily chart to time your entry into the trade most patterns in general do n't really determine how long you will be in the trade but instead usually can provide an entry trigger a stop loss location and possibly a profit target   so in general a pattern which is being used to enter into longer term trades on weekly charts can also be used to enter shorter term trades on intra day charts

these scenarios discuss the period to 2025 they assess the deep uncertainty that is decision taking they identify the roots of this as the failure of the social model on which the west has operated since the related and pending problems imply that this situation is not recoverable without major change for example pensions shortfalls are greater in real terms that entire expenditure on world war ii and health care and age support will that due to the prolonged recession competition will impact complex industries earlier than expected   social responses which seek job protection the maintenance of welfare and also support in old age will tear at the social fabric of the industrial world there are ways to meet this implying a major change in approach and a characteristic way in which to fail to respond to it in time creating a dangerous and unstable world the need for such change will alter the social and commercial environment very considerably the absence of such change will alter it even more   the summary is available or at the foot of the link given in the the much richer paper is   these scenarios are the latest in a series in a project that dates back to 1995 over a hundred people participated from every continent over a six month period the working documents are available on the web

not perhaps practically useful but i found it conceptually useful to learn the basics of mathematical finance a way of describing financial markets via probability theory and stochastic processes it 's a little like trying to understand horse racing by studying horses rolling without friction in a vacuum but it does give you some ways of thinking that may be more appealing to someone with a math background for instance there 's the idea that shorting a stock is effectively owning negative shares option pricing is a common motivation there 's a brief introduction at the advanced undergraduate level in 's essentials of stochastic processes at the graduate level i liked williams introduction to the mathematics of finance

if you want the cheapest online broker in australia you ca n't go past cmc markets they charge $ 9.90 upto a $ 10,000 trade and 0.1 above that there is no ongoing fees unless you choose to have dynamic data stock prices get updated automatically as they change however the dynamic data fee does get waived if you have about 10 or more trades per month you do n't really need the dynamic data unless you are a regular trader anyway they also provide some good research tools and some basic charting your funds with them are kept in a account so are safe they do n't provide the best interest on funds kept in the account so it is best to just deposit the funds when you are looking to buy and move your funds earning higher interest when selling hopes this helps regards victor update they have now increased their basic brokerage to a minimum of $ 11 per trade unless you are a frequent trader

there 's a ton of great advice here   it 's very challenging to come up with something that has n't already been suggested   i 'm curious to know how many years you have left to pay down the mortgage at the regular rate of payment   if it 's more than 15 years it might be worthwhile to consider refinancing your mortgage to a shorter term 15 years or even 10 years if your income supports it   rates on fixed interest mortgages at those terms are down in the 3 range and lower at least according to bankrate.com   refinancing to a shorter term would be another way of paying off your home faster with fewer of those dollars going toward interest payments if you 've got fewer than 15 years left to pay off your mortgage following any of the other advice you 've received here should keep you in great financial shape

when we speak about a product or service we generally refer to its value currency while neither a product or service has its own value as the value of currency goes down the price of products bought by that currency will go up you could consider the price of a product or service the value of the product multiplied by the value of the currency for your first example we compare two cars one bought in 1990 and one bought in 2015 each car has the same features ac radio abs etc we can say that when these products were new each had the same value however we can deduce that since the 1990 car cost $ 100 and the 2015 car cost $ 400 that there has been 75 inflation over 25 years comparing prices over time helps identify the inflation or devaluation of currency that an economy is experiencing in regards to your second question you can say that there was 7 inflation over five years total keep in mind that these are absolute cumulative values it does n't mean that there was a 7 increase year over year that would be 35 inflation over five years but simply that the absolute value of the dollar has changed 7 over those five years the sum of the percentages over those five years will be less than 7 because inflation is measured yearly but the total cumulative change is 7 from the original value to put that in perspective say that you have $ 100 in 2010 with an expected 7 inflation by 2015 which means that your $ 100 will be worth $ 93 in 2015 this means that the yearly inflation would be about 1.5 for five years resulting in a total of 7 inflation over five years note that you still have a hundred dollar bill in your pocket that you 've saved for five years but now that money can buy less product for example if you say that $ 100 buys 50 gallons of gasoline $ in 2010 you will only be able to afford gallons with that same bill in 2015 $ as you can see the 7 inflation caused a 7 increase in gasoline prices in other words if the value of the car remained the same its actual price would go up because the value stayed the same however it 's more likely that the car 's value will decrease significantly in those five years perhaps as much as 50 or more in some cases but its price would be higher than it would have been without inflation if the car 's value had dropped 50 so $ 50 in original year prices then it would have a higher price 50 value 1.07 currency ratio = $ note that even though its value has decreased by half its price has not decreased by 50 because it was up by inflation for your final question the purpose of a loan is so that the loaner will make a profit from the transaction consider your prior example where there was 7 inflation over five years that means that a loan for $ 100 in 2010 would only be worth $ 93 in 2015 interest is how loans combat this loss of value as well as to earn some profit so if the loaner expects 7 inflation over five years they 'll charge some higher interest say 8 10 or even more so that when you pay them back on time they 'll come out ahead or they might use more advanced schemes like adjustable rates etc so interest rates will naturally be lower when forecasted inflation is lower and higher when forecasted inflation is higher the best time to get a loan is when interest rates are if you get locked into a high interest loan and inflation stalls they will make more money off of you because the currency has more value while if inflation skyrockets your loan will be worth less to loaner however they 're usually really good about predicting inflation so it would take an incredible amount of inflation to actually come out on top of a loan

an oxymoron is something that contradicts itself inside trading is sharing information that is n't public how the fuck do you think these hedge funds and investment banks can offer almost 50 returns during these times in our economy oh yea it 's called inside trading reason why it 's an oxymoron is because trading information is considered yet that what everyone does on the market rules are made to give off fear but past that it 's all open roads and deep pockets     and if you really do n't believe that stock market is n't rigged then there is no reason for me to explain myself on that because it would be like taking to a wall and i thank you for being one of those people that thinks it 's not rigged because you help my portfolio look good from your dumb investments

gt though i 'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome i think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :p       i will say that to your point i have come to believe that there are two forces at odds that are required for a robust and long lived prosperous society   1   a capitalist system that encourages innovation through competition and   2   a government to check the inevitable concentration of wealth that capitalism naturally trends toward   they most effective ways for a government to check that concentration is through a progressive tax system and a check on the power that the concentration of wealth creates eg forcing employers to pay a living wage instead of using a bully to extract the maximum effort for the lowest possible cost as shown by the robber barons etc of the 1900s   either way i 'll admit that i am not talking about pure capitalism   however like the philosopher all ideas go through a process of thesis the first idea aka capitalism the idea in this case socialism and then synthesis the resulting compromise   the synthesis then becomes the new thesis for the system to further evolve upon   it 's time for american capitalism to evolve

the money that you have under your control e.g. in bank accounts savings accounts taxable investments etc is your money and there is no tax of any kind either in india or in us that needs to be paid when the money is transferred to india as dheer 's answer says you need to transfer all these monies within 7 years as per indian tax law for your 401(k account assuming that all the money is tax deferred i.e. you contributed to a regular 401(k and not a roth 401(k you will have separated from service as far as us tax law is concerned so check if it is at all possible to roll over the money into a similar scheme in india specifically the employees provident fund wikipedia says the schemes covers both indian and international workers for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed 14 such social security agreements are active and so a rollover might be possible if not you could withdraw small amounts each year and avoid us income tax but not the 10 excise tax but how long you can continue holding 401(k assets after return to india and whether that is long enough to drain the 401(k are things that you need to find out

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

yes because you can not have an exponential growth rate that is faster than the rate at which the economy grows on the long term 100 growth is much more than the few percent at which the economy grows so your share in the world economy would approximately double every year today the value of all the assets in the world economy is about $ 200 trillion if you start with an investment of just $ 1000 and this doubles every year then you 'll own all the world 's assets in years assuming this does n't grow you can of course take into account that it does grow this will yield a slightly larger time before you own the entire world

there are a few other items that you should be aware of when getting options the strike price is usually determined by an independent valuation of the common shares called a valuation this should give you a sense on what the options are worth obviously you are hoping that the value becomes many multiple of that there are two kinds in the us non and incentive stock options isos   the big difference is that when you exercise non you have to pay the tax on the difference between the fair market value on the shares and what you paid for them the strike price   this is important because if the company is private you likely can not sell any shares until it is public with isos you do n't pay any tax except amt tax on the gain until you actually sell the shares   you should know what kind your getting some plans allow for early exercise essentially allowing you to buy the shares early and given back if you leave before they vest which helps you establish capital gains treatment earlier as well as avoid amt if you have isos this is really complicated direction and you would want to talk to a tax professional   and always a good idea to know how many total shares outstanding in the company very few people ask this question but it is helpful for you to understand the overall value of the options

this article is hilariously wrong   they studied companies that are already structured in such a way that they pay far less than rates   the vast majority of companies do not have sprawling international operations and can not benefit from these types of structures thus they are paying tax rates far closer to rates   the study is looking at the wrong companies and drawing a false conclusion from them   it ’s simple math   reducing tax rates makes companies more profitable providing more capital for expand and grow   growth requires adding employees   only a moron would argue that companies are better off and will grow faster when more of their profits are taken from them via taxation

degree of operating leverage dol measures the percent change in ebit given a 1 change in revenue in other words if dol is 1.5 then increasing revenue by 1 will increase ebit by 1.5   degree of financial leverage measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in ebit   degree of total leverage cuts ebit out and measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in revenue    what all three of these numbers measure is elasticity the elasticity between two variables is always the percentage change effect on one due to a 1 change in the other    before we talk about why you would multiply let ’s first just look at absolute changes between a change of three variables x y and z. lets say x impacts y and y impacts z to make it even more concrete let ’s imagine a classroom where every student is required to have 2 books and every book has 100 pages so x = students y = of books and z = of pages if we add one student to the class we need to add 2 books if we add 1 book to the class we have added 100 pages with absolute changes like this it is obvious that we do n’t add we multiply in other words to directly see the impact of a new student on the number of pages x -&gt z we would say 1 student -&gt 2 books -&gt 200 pages to say 102 pages would obviously be silly    for percent changes this looks pretty similar to make it easy say the class has 100 students so adding 1 student is a 1 change then we go from 200 books to 202 books a 1 change so the degree of student to book leverage is 1 which make sense there are no fixed pages we go from 20,000 pages to pages also a 1 change so the degree of book to page leverage is also 1 thus the student to page leverage is also just a flat 1    let ’s add fixed amounts the teacher has a single 2,000 page book on how to teach we ’ll assume the class has 20 students so we start with 20 2 + 1 = 41 books and 40 100 + 2,000 = 6,000 pages let ’s add a student we have a -1 = 4 increase in students -1 = increase in books 1 = 3.33 increase in pages so the degree of student to book leverage is = and the degree of book to page leverage is = and the direct student to page leverage is = 1.20 again note that here it would be silly to add the degrees of leverage and when we do multiply them we get = 1.2 the right answer    from here the application to ebit = sales fixed cost variable cost = gross margin sales fixed cost and the application to eps = ebit interest taxes = 1 tax interest should be obvious i can supply the full proof mathematically however if you would like

can i work on 1099 from my own company instead of on w2 the reason is    on w2 i ca n't deduct my commute health insurance and some other    expenses while on 1099 i think i can able do that since i am going to    client place to work not at my own office i am not sure whether i    should able to do that or not if you have llc unless you elected to tax it as a corporation you need neither 1099 nor w2 for tax purposes the llc is disregarded so it is from tax perspective a sole proprietorship or partnership if multiple members being a w2 employee of your own llc is a bad idea for all these above expenses which can i use company 's debit credit    card or i need to use only my personal debit credit card it would be better to always use a business account for business purposes does n't matter much for tax per se but will make your life easier in case of an audit or a legal dispute limited liability protection may depend on it if i work on 1099 i guess i need to file some reasonable taxes on    quarterly basis instead of filing at year end if so how do i pay my    tax on quarterly basis to irs i mean which forms should i file and    how to pay tax unless you 're a w2 employee you need to do quarterly estimate payments using form 1040-es if you are a w2 employee even for a different job and even if it is not you but your spouse with whom you 're filing jointly you can adjust your spouse 's withholding using form w4 to cover the additional tax liability this is imho a better way than paying estimates there are numerous questions on this search the site or ask another one for details

i 'll second what littleadv says about the entertainment expenses they do seem high relative to your income   the numbers for electricity and vehicle insurance seem high to me as well but that depends on where you live and how you heat your house etc so they may be normal for your situation you 've got almost $ 500/month going to debt payments vehicle window replacement and student loan   you did n't list the credit card payments on there so that will add to the debt payment amount   finding a way to get those debts paid off as quickly as possible would free up a lot of cash flow   you could consider trying to find extra income second job your wife getting a job or finding a way to make some money from home sell some things etc i 'm wondering about the things i do n't see here food including restaurants clothing fuel maintenance and repairs both car and house etc etc   with the numbers you list above you have money left over every month but when you add in the things i just mentioned that may not be the case i suggest that you keep track of all of your expenses for the next month to see what you 're really spending including the things not listed here   then using that information make a plan for the following month and every month thereafter about how you 're going to live on what you bring home   just tracking your expenses will likely show you some areas where you could easily cut back on spending    also i recommend that you start working on a plan to increase your income both temporarily as i suggest above and longer term by focusing on your career direction   you are above the poverty level assuming you live in the us but below average in income

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

as others have already pointed out there is no monetary sensible reason to borrow at 5 cost to invest at 1 return however just because it does n't make perfect sense financially does n't mean it ca n't make sense for peace of mind and you should not dismiss the peace of mind argument out of hand ignoring tax effects credit score effects cost of higher levels of insurance required etc and assuming a five year repayment plan borrowing $ 15,000 at 5 will cost you about $ for a total cost of $ 1 interest on the same $ 15,000 would give you about $ in other words your loan premium is $ interest expense about $ on the car loan reduced by interest earned $ on the retained savings plus the capital repayment amount if you were to take the money out of savings you would probably want to replenish that over a similar time period ignoring interest saving $ 15,000 in five years means $ so this boils down to the $ interest premium now consider that the times when an emergency fund is most often needed are very often the times when banks will be reluctant to extend a loan a job loss being a common example while foreclosing on an existing loan can still happen as long as you keep making payments i suspect that most banks are far more willing to overlook the fact that you would not have qualified for the loan after the job loss if a loss of income situation develops after you pay the car with your savings without a loan you start out with $ 15,000 in the bank plus whatever car payments to yourself you have been able to save afterwards depending on when things turn bad for you this could mean that you having only half of the savings that you used to but of course you also have no car payment expense which is the same as you do now if a loss of income situation develops while you are still paying off the car you start out with $ 30,000 in the bank instead of $ 15,000 but run the risk of having to make the car payments with money out of your savings the net result of that is that your savings are potentially effectively reduced by whatever the remaining debt outstanding on the car is which in turn is reduced over time even if you were not to actively save your net financial situation becomes better over time if a loss of income situation develops after you have paid off the car you now own the car free and clear and still have $ 30,000 in the bank assuming that you would repay yourself on a schedule similar to that of a car loan if you took the $ 15,000 out of the bank instead this is a very similar situation consequently the important consideration becomes is it worth it to you to pay $ extra to have an extra $ 15,000 on hand if something happens to your financial situation i have been in pretty much exactly the same situation albeit with smaller amounts and determined that having the cash on hand was worth the small additional interest expense not the least of which because i was able to secure a loan at a pretty good interest rate and with no early repayment penalties you may reach a different conclusion and that 's okay but do consider it

there is no one answer to this question but there are some generalities most exchanges make a distinction between the passive and the aggressive sides of a trade   the passive participant is the order that was resting on the market at the time of the trade   it is an order that based on its price was not at the time and therefore goes into the order book   for example i 'm willing to sell 100 shares of a stock at $ 9.98 but nobody wants to buy that right now so it remains as an open order on the exchange then somebody comes along and is willing to meet my price i am glossing over lots of details here   so they aggressively take out my order by either posting a market buy or specifically that they want to buy 100 shares at either $ 9.98 or at some higher price most exchanges will actually give me as the passive i.e. liquidity making investor a small rebate while the other person is charged a few fractions of a cent   google found details and most other exchanges make their fees public as well   as of this writing the generic price charged credited but they provide volume discounts and many of the larger deals do fall into another tier of volume which provides a different price structure

it is a legal issue for two reasons in the united states if both names were on the title both people would have had to sign the paperwork in order to transfer the title if the car was collateral for the loan then the bank would have had to be involved in the transaction the portion of the check need to repay the loan would have had to have been made out to the bank if the car was sold to a dealership then paperwork must have been forged if the car was sold to a person then it is possible that they were too naive to know what paperwork was required but it is likely still fraud you need legal advice to protect your money and your credit score they should also be able to tell you who needs to be contacted dmv the police the dealership the bank

ignore sunk costs and look to future returns   although it feels like a loss to exit an investment from a loss position from a financial standpoint you should ignore the purchase price   if your money could be better invested somewhere else then move it there you should n't look at it as though you 'll be more financially secure because you waited longer for the stock to reach the purchase price   that 's psychological not financial some portion of your invested wealth is stuck in this particular stock   if it would take three months for the stock to get back to purchase price but only two months for an alternate investment to reach that same level then obviously faster growth is better   your goal is greater wealth not arbitrarily returning certain investments to their purchase price investments are just instrumental   you want more wealth   if an investment is not performing then ignore purchase price and costs   look at the reasonable expectations about an investment going forward

buying and selling cars a lot is something that makes money if you are a dealer but usually does n't if you are not   the question to ask yourself is why you want to sell it    if it is because you are feeling poor and need money it might make sense to sell it particularly if you do n't need it   but $ 12k or whatever is not a ton of money   if you do need a car and will have to replace it if you sell it then selling it is likely not a good idea if it is because you want a nicer car and can afford to upgrade then selling it is likely a good idea   the fact that you have had it for years and not paid off the loan tells me this situation is unlikely you should think of the value of your car to you and the potential cost of replacing it and the amount of money you owe on it as two different things   the debt you have is a debt that you will need to pay no matter what you do with the car or how its value changes   the value of the car to you is pretty much a separate issue from how much you have outstanding in debt    if you want to sell the car to pay off the debt that is fine if you do n't need the car or if you can get a suitable replacement car for much less which i find unlikely

making a game is hard enough focus on that if when you start getting close to having something to sell then if you 're serious and want the company to grow into a full time venture briefly consult with a lawyer and possibly accountant to set this up it will save you a lot of time researching what you have to do and a lot of headache from potentially doing things wrong if you want to try to do it on your own i 'd recommend getting a book on starting a business because there is more to know than a single post can cover   you 'll probably have to file for a dba doing business as at your city hall in order to be allowed to refer to yourself as the name of your company otherwise you have to use your personal name initiating that will likely initiate annual business taxes in your town in addition to the cheap filing fee you also want to consider how you will handle trademark of your business and game and copyright of your game if this is going to grow you 'll have to have contracts written for either employees or for freelancers who might produce assets for you you may also need to consider writing an for your game privacy policies etc additionally you 'll likely have to file with your state to collect and send sales tax you 'll also want to meticulously track costs and revenue related to your business formally starting a business will likely open you up to property sales and income tax for example where i am was even taxed on the equipment the business uses e.g. computers this is why it makes sense to wait until you 're closer to having a product before you try to formally start a business and to consult with professionals on the best way   the type of business you should form will depend on the scope you plan for the company and the amount of time money you 're willing to put in a sole proprietorship what you are by default means there is no difference legally financially between you as an individual and you as a company this may be suitable if this is just a hobby but not if you intend it to grow because that means any lawsuit directed at your company and its money is also directed at you and your money the differences between an llc and corporation are more nuanced and involve differences in legal and tax treatment however they both shield you from the previously mentioned problem if you want this to be more than a hobby you should form either an llc or a corporation do some research on the differences and how they might apply to you and in your state

the scenarios you describe are obviously easy to catch it is reasonably defined in tax law but more needs to be done to exert the spirit of the rules the problem is that when international businesses are cross charging   there is limited information the tax offices have to argue the toss for example a uk tax office can not audit the accounts of its us parent in order to decide whether a cross charge representing license fees and marketing costs is fair but these types of transaction are one of the primary mechanism for avoiding taxes these are inferred by the uk companies accounts but not in the open in the sense that they can be easily challenged with accurate information and that is why it happens people know about it but it is still not easy to stop

two reasons many people make lots of financial decisions and other kinds of decisions without actually running any numbers to see what is best or even possible   they just go with their gut and buy things they feel like buying without making a attempt to assess the impact on their finances   i share your at this but it is true a example that has stuck with me can be found in this los angeles times story from a few years ago which describes a family spending $ 1000 more than their income every month while defaulting on their mortgage and dipping into their old daughter 's savings account to cover the bills but still spending $ 275 a month on beauty products and services and $ 200 a month on pet expenses even to the extent that people do take finances into account finances are not the only thing they take into account   for many people driving a car that is new looks nice and fresh has the latest features etc is something they are willing to pay money for   your question why do n't people view a car solely as a means of transportation is not a financial question but a psychological one   the answer to why do people buy new cars is because people do not view cars solely as a means of transportation i recently bought a used car and while looking around at different ones i visited a car lot   when the dealer heard which car i was interested in he said so i guess you 're looking for a transportation car   i thought to myself duh   is there any other kind   but the fact that someone can say something like that indicates that there are many people who are looking for something other than a transportation car

these kinds of questions can be rather tricky i 've struggled with this sort of thing in the past when i had income from a hobby and i wanted to ensure that it was indeed hobby income and i did n't need to call it self employment here are a few resources from the irs there 's a lot of overlap among these resources of course here 's the relevant portion of publication 535 which i think is reasonable guidance on how the irs looks at things in determining whether you are carrying on an activity for profit several factors are taken into account no one factor alone is decisive among the factors to consider are whether most of the guidance looks to be centered around what one would need to do to convince the irs that an activity actually is a business because then one can deduct the business expenses even if that brings the total business income negative and i 'm guessing that 's a fraud problem the irs needs to deal with more often there 's not nearly as much about how to convince the irs that an activity is n't a business and thus can be thrown into other income instead of needing to pay self employment tax presumably the same principles should apply going either way though if after reading through the information they provide you decide in good faith that your activity is really just other income and not a business you 're in on the side i would find it likely that the irs would agree with you if they ever questioned you on it and you provided your reasoning assuming your reasoning is reasonable though it 's always possible that reasonable people could end up disagreeing on some things even given the same set of facts just keep good records about what you did and why and do n't get too panicked about it once you 've done your due diligence just file based on all the information you know

you need to talk to the 401(k administrator or hr for the exact details typically you can only borrow 50 of your balance and can pay it back up to a ten year term some plans have different rules this is just a common offering   the larger issue is whether the loan prevents you from making further deposits till repaid this would cost you not just the growth in the account but the matched deposits for those years that would be a deal killer for me if that were the case i 'd drop my deposits to only get the match and save for a real deposit without the loan

hopefully before you invested in this stock you evaluated the company   you looked at the financial information about the company and where the company was headed and evaluated whether the stock was undervalued or overvalued   hopefully you determined that the stock was undervalued at the time you bought it the thing to do now is to reevaluate the stock   do you think the stock is overvalued or undervalued right now   if you did n't own it would you buy it today   instead of looking at the past performance of the stock you want to try to determine which direction the stock will go from today   if you would n't buy it today at it 's current price then you should sell if you have no idea how to do this evaluation neither do i.   for me with the investing knowledge i have right now investing in an individual stock would be way too risky   if you do n't know how to evaluate a stock and determine if it is a good buy or not then you should stay away from individual stocks and instead invest in stock mutual funds which lower the risk by diversifying over lots of stocks

part 1 quite a few or rather most countries allow usd account so there is no conversion    just to in india its allowed to have a usd account the funds can be transfered as usd and withdrawn as usd the interest is in usd there no conversion at any point in time typically the rates for cd on usd account was central bank regulated rate of 5 recently this was deregulated and some banks offer around 7 interest    why is the rate high on usd in india there is a trade deficit which means india gets less usd and has to pay more usd to buy stuff oil and other essential items the balance is typically borrowed say from imf or other countries etc allowing banks to offer high interest rate is one way to attract more usd into the country in short term because in time they may take back the usd out of india so why is n't everyone jumping and making usd in india the non residents who eventually plan to come back have invested in usd in india there is a risk of regulation changes ie if the central bank country comes up pressure for forex reserves they may make it to take back the usd ie they may impose charges taxes or force conversion on such accounts the kyc norms make it difficult for indian bank to attract us citizens except non resident indians certain countries would have explicit regulations to prevent other nationals from investing in such products as they may lead to volatility ie all of them suddenly pull out the funds there would be no insurance to foreign nationals    part 2 the fdic insurance is not the reason for lower rates most countires have similar insurance for bank deposits for account    the reason for lower rate is all the china etc park the excess funds in us treasuries because 1 it is safe 2 it is required for any international purchase 3 it is very liquid    now if the us fed started giving higher interest rates to bonds say 5 it essentially paying more to other countries so its keeping the interest rates low even at 1 there are enough people institutions who would keep the money with us treasury    so the us treasury has to make some revenue from the funds kept at it it lends at lower interest rates to bank who in turn lend it to borrowers both corporate and retail    now if they can borrow cheaply from fed why would they pay more to individual retail on cd they will pay less because the lending rates are low as well    part 3 check out the regulations

actually the rate of change could be more or less constant but you might have a minimum price that represents your fixed costs   so you might sell a for $ 1 which is ridiculous in terms of per unit pricing to cover fixed costs and add $ for each step in size to cover variable costs cost of raw materials and packaging so a 2 lb bag would be $ 2 a 5 lb bag would be $ 3.50 a ton would be $ etc   at the end of the day you want the marginal revenue the price that you charge for each additional pound to be more than the marginal cost the price per pound it takes to produce the bag   any amount over that goes towards your fixed costs the cost you 'd incur if you sold zero product rent utilities overhead etc it 's not an exact science and there are many variables that go into pricing

for a company the size of amazon a 1 increase in prices is substantial   many of their products are in competitive price sensitive markets   there are some products that people would notice a 1 difference from competitors   so the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive   however that would still mean reduced sales   in short i do n't think amazon is foregoing a 50 bump in profits if they could get it   also a 5 sga cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization   in any one year that would mean an effective ~10 cut once you factor in inflation

millionaires    no offense but you 're talking out of your ass     my mother lives in a house that my parents bought in the 1980s   she 's definitely not a millionaire   nowhere close   but she owns the house free amp clear and can afford the taxes   i bought my house from a retired lady for about 5x what she paid for it in the   maybe more   i do n't recall but she was the original owner   definitely not a millionaire   just a retired widow   most of the folks who own these 1950s to 1980s homes in good areas are beneficiaries of good locations and lack of development     the reason those homes are so valuable is because we 're not building new housing in anything resembling the scale needed   we need something like 40,000 new units built annually in los angeles and orange counties to catch up to the population growth and lack of new construction happening now   it ai n't gon na happen but that 's what we need     in 20 years i 'll benefit from prop 13   it flows   and it benefits property owners   it encourages property ownership     if you wanted to argue that property taxes on commercial properties should be different from residential properties i 'd be up for the debate   it 's an interesting topic and i do n't know the answer but it would result in wholesale reduction in commercial property values in the state because of the reduced cash flow from higher taxes   huge and a massive transfer of wealth from commercial property owners to the taxpayers

the initial and overnight margin requirements are set by the exchanges who calculate them using the standard portfolio of analysis of risk or span system and positions are market to market according to these at the end of the trading session to find these margin requirements you will need to consult the website of the exchange on which the contract you are trading is issued i.e. if you 're trading on the london metal exchange it 's no good looking at the chicago mercantile exchange 's margin requirements as a previous answer suggests however for positions entered and exited within the same day the margin rate will apply this is set by your broker rather than the exchange and can be as little as 10 of the exchange requirement you can find a useful comparison of different margin types and requirements in the article i have published here understanding margin for futures trading

if you live in a country that taxes interest and if this is a significant amount of money in a high interest account then the tax forms will serve as a reminder even though the advice is to forget about the money so that you do n't dip into it for trivial things you do need to look at it every so often to make sure it is still in a high interest account the info about the account also needs to be kept in a place where somebody else can track it down if a spouse or dependent has to use the money in the emergency

does such insurance make any sense or is it just wasting money for passengers as with most insurance it depends if you just look at the probability of a payout the cost of the insurance and the payout amount then statistically it will always be better to avoid buying insurance this is because there is a certain amount of overhead in an insurance company like the commissions and salaries you mentioned the goal when buying insurance should be to avoid a cost that you can not afford or is inconvenient to be able to afford for example if your family would be devastated financially by your death then it would make sense for you to buy some sort of life insurance whether or not this particular insurance makes sense for you depends on your financial situation and risk tolerance

if the correction results in you owing them money you typically just need to pay them the appropriate amount i believe they charge back dated interest on the amount if it was supposed to have been paid in the past but if it 's for this year 's taxes then payment is n't due until the end of april and so interest would not apply in some circumstances they may apply fines or press charges for tax evasion but only if they have reason to believe you intentionally knowingly attempted to your tax return in order to avoid paying taxes you can challenge their decision to fine you but you are considered guilty until proven innocent obviously that 's the opposite for any criminal charges the good news is lots of people accidentally enter the wrong numbers and the cra is aware of this and rarely takes action against them other than making them pay what they owe they have ways to look for suspicious behavior and differentiate that from innocent mistakes so do n't worry you should be fine not fined

the real is in believing that somehow regulators are going to be able to prevent crashes or even if this is desirable   usually the idea that regulators can prevent crashes relies on regulators being issued a retroactive time machine   crashes   happen    if regulators had more power and more authority prior to 2008 the housing market crash would have been worse and more severe than it actually was because regulators were like everyone else they believed house prices would never go down and were focussing their efforts on regulating   banks to lend more money to riskier borrowers

its different because at least with both stock options and futures the product is going to eventually get that money   the difference is that you do n't have to spend that money directly on that product right now allowing you to invest far more then you can afford since you are going to cover that option or sell that contract long before you are ever going to be on hook for actually buying all those stocks or barrels of oil you were trading   it 's actually a good way for a middle class investor to become really wealthy because if he is good all he needs is to save only about 10,000 to invest and he can invest like he 's investing 100,000   obviously there 's more risk too but give and take i guess

some stocks do fall to zero i do n't have statistics handy but i 'd guess that a majority of all the companies ever started are now bankrupt and worth zero even if a company does not go bankrupt there is no guarantee that it 's value will increase forever even in a general overall sense you might buy a stock when it is at or near its peak and then it loses value and never it even if a stock will go back up you ca n't know for certain that it will suppose you bought a stock for $ 10 and it 's now at $ 5 if you sell you lose half your money but if you hold on it might go back up and you make a profit or it might continue going down and you lose even more perhaps your entire investment a rational person might decide to sell now and cut his losses of course i 'm sure many investors have had the experience of selling a stock at a loss and then seeing the price skyrocket but there have also been plenty of investors who decided to hold on only to lose more money just a couple of weeks ago a stock i bought for $ 1.50 was selling for $ 14 i could have sold for like 900 profit instead i decided to hold on and see if it went yet higher it 's now at $ 2.50 fortunately i only invested something like $ 800 if it goes to zero it will be annoying but not ruin me on a bigger scale if you invest in a variety of stocks and hold on to them for a long period of time the chance that you will lose money is small the stock market as a whole has consistently gone up in the long term but the chance is not zero and a key phrase is in the long term if you need the money today the fact that the market will probably go back up within a few months or a year or so may not help

changes in graduated income tax rates do n't necessarily drive how you should allocate money to a traditional vs roth account true for both ira or 401k what does drive this decision is what your income tax rate is now compared to what you believe your rate will be when you retire so if you expect the tax rate change to still be in effect when you retire it does n't matter if the change is a tax increase or decrease your previous allocation could likely remain the same this means that if congress passed the change effective immediately it would be too late for you to make a meaningful adjustment but if congress passes the change effective next year then most likely your tax rate will decrease for next year meaning you are probably better off switching all roth allocations to traditional and then switching them back to whatever allocations you have now for next year the reverse would be true if you knew about an upcoming tax increase in which case you would load up roth this year and then switch back to whatever you had for next year that being said regarding after the fact considerations i suppose it would be fair to say that if the country is accustomed to a higher tax rate and then rates are dropped if spending is not cut to make up for it then rates would likely have to go up again in the future to make up the difference if you believe that will happen then roths would become a little more attractive since rates would be lower than what you expect them to be when you retire as a side note if you ever had reason to believe that congress was going to move away from the graduated income tax structure all bets are off for example if the income tax was replaced with a tax on spending such as the then in the interim period roths would become worthless and you 'd want to switch to until the change went into effect and then once in effect both roths and would be pointless

just to add the 20 apr is the annualized interest rate but applied monthly so you 'd be charged $ 0.50 of interest on your $ 30 balance which gets capitalized on the next month so if you were to miss the next payment for some reason your new interest charge would be on $ instead of $ 30 actually it 'd be much more since there would be a fee for the late payment but discounting that to illustrate the point

20 is almost certainly too high i agree with 2 as a very rough rule it will vary significantly depending on the industry i generally calculate an average of the previous 2 3 years working capital and deduct that from cash working capital is current assets less current liabilities current assets is comprised of cash prepaid expenses and significantly accounts receivable this means that ca is likely to be much higher than just cash which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted which reduces ev which makes the ev ebitda ratio look even more pricey as noted but a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter as such and because of seasonal effects it 's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods after calculating this for a few companies compare to revenue is it close to 2

alot of these answers have focused on the dilution aspect but from a purely legal aspect there are usually corporate bylaws that spell out what kind of vote and percentage of votes is needed to take this type of action   if all other holders of stock voted to do this so 90 for and you did n't so 10 against it 's still legal if that vote meets the threshold for taking the action as an example of this i known of a startup where employees got $ for their vested shares when the company was sold because the voting stock holders agreed to it   effectively the purchase amount was just enough to cover debts and preferred stock

dunno who downvoted you   yes that as far as i understand your us glass steagall act is what he 's advocating   in the late 1990s when you guys were repealing your gs act we in the uk were doing the same with our version of the same idea thus permitting lunatic risk taking investment bankers to start playing with the deposited money of savings banks   yadda yadda yadda time passed investment bankers took all of our money down the shitter and then we had to pay them off because they had n't just lost their own money they had also lost all of our money too hence bank bailouts which were really the government bailing us out because we had all been goddamn fucking stupid enough to invest our money in investment banks instead of savings banks   wants to re separate the investment banks from the savings banks again because this is the second time this has happened and we could do with the peace that will come from putting up walls that it will take another 80 years for the bankers to lobby down again

if there was still money in the account when it was closed the bank would have turned over the cash to the state where they operated search google for unclaimed property < state name > for the unclaimed property department of the state the state 's website will show if there is money for you

the policies he claims to support put him pretty far out of that camp   immigration at least the policies he s claimed to support trade dropping of tpp claiming to renegotiate nafta etc cutting financial support for global political organizations and dropping out of the paris agreement and in general his america first platform     now how these actually play out is a matter of several other factors and could have just been campaign promises but in general his formal positions put him pretty far away from globalist camps   although i was specifically talking about zuckerberg here not so much president trump in this situation

we 're talking about american workers here not workers from third world countries    in america everyone gets a free public education and has access to numerous social safety nets the people that really want to make it happen here can make it happen   one of my very best friends took the bus 3 hours each way to get to jr college so he could go to film school he moved out to hollywood and was living with me for a few months after he had gotten a job out here he got laid off and had to go home when he got home his parents drug tested him and kicked him out because he had smoked weed 1 time right before he left with no money and no job he moved in with his brother in a one bedroom apartment his brother proceeded to get fired and neither of them had anything he was the hiring people at several editing places out in l.a. all the while looking for coins in the parking lot of fast food restaurants so he could get something to eat finally he got a job back out in l.a. making a little over $ 10 an hour he moved back here busted his ass and now makes around $ 90k a year    o and all this excluding film school has happened since may of 2011    3rd world countries are entirely different than the issues that wal mart workers in america face it 's not an apples to apples comparison americans that are working in a wal mart shipping center that want more pay need to go out and better themselves and provide a service that society values    just showing up for your 8 hours a day and stacking boxes in trucks is not of high value here and they should be paid as such

i think another point was that squeezing a bag of stuff between two flat plates is inherently harder than squeezing it from one end with a roller so that explains why the machines cost so much the gears and whatnot in the press were huge and the electrical stuff was all pretty non standard too
