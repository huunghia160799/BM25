reimbursements for business expenses are generally not taxable but the commute from home to the job and back is not considered business travel and if they 're paying for that it is taxable income i do n't think changes that but i am not a tax lawyer or accountant the rest of your questions seem to be company policy issues there is no should here you are n't required to pick up the other guys but he is n't required to reimburse those miles or employ you so think carefully about your priorities before pushing back never invoke what thou not

you 're getting paid by the job not by the hour so i do n't see why you think the employer is obligated to pay you for the drive time   the only way that might be true as far as i can see is if he were avoiding paying you minimum wage by structuring your employment this way   it looks like to me you 're over the minimum wage based on what you wrote   at maximum unpaid drive time 59 min each way and maximum length of job 4 hours as you stated it gives your minimum hourly rate of $ the federal minimum wage is currently $ so you 're over that   a quick search online suggests that nv does have a higher minimum at $ under some conditions but you 're still over that too the fact that you 're required to pick up the and that you have a company car at home probably does mean that you 're on the clock from the moment that you leave your house but again you 're not actually being paid by the clock   as long as no other law is being broken and it appears from your telling that there is n't then the employer can set any policy for how to compute the compensation that he wants regarding taxes the employer probably has no discretion there   you 're making what you 're making and the employer needs to tax it in total   since you 're driving a company vehicle from home i do n't think that you 're entitled to any reimbursement vs. wages that would not be taxed unless maybe you pay for gas yourself   the gas money if applicable should be reimbursable as a business expense and that generally would not be taxed

this is an older question but things have changed its a common misconception on what the contribution cap is a few things in 2014 the irs did not adjust the maximum contribution from the previous year which include 401(k accounts 403(b accounts most 457 plans and thrift savings plans will be $ 18,000 up $ 500 from $ 17,500 savers and investors aged 50 or older can take advantage of a catch up contribution in 2015 taxpayers who meet this age based criterion can contribute an additional $ 6,000 above the regular maximum of $ 18,000 thus you can contribute a maximum of $ 24,000 into these tax advantaged accounts   the total contribution limit including employer contributions has increased to $ 53,000 you can actually contribute up to   53k including matching so the exact amount you contribute from your actual income may end up being more or less than 24k if you get a poor employer match you can actually contribute more but it would go in as after tax dollars and not claim the tax deduction note after tax does not equal roth   however if your a high salaried individual you can use this as a potential loop hole for funding a roth ira chances are if your making enough money to contribute 53k total contributions then your not going to qualify for a roth however once you retire or possibly before depending on the plan withdraw terms you can roll the after tax money into a roth ira this is a gray area on the tax policy the irs may come back and change their mind about this if considering this option talk to a tax adviser

generally cashiers checks do not expire since they are like cash and fully funded at the time of issue however whether they can be cashed after a long period of time and also what the definition of long is depends on the bank eventually if left uncashed it probably would be to the state to wait for someone to claim it being that it 's been less than a year i expect it could be cashed by the payee written on the check without any issues if the payee is deceased then the check can be cashed by the estate as it should be considered the property of the estate the same way it would be if it had already been cashed and was now sitting in a bank account in your mother 's name under normal circumstances the estate in this case would go to your mother 's spouse first then to you and your siblings if you have any unless there is a will specifying otherwise the only way your aunt would be able to deposit the check on her own is if she was listed as an or on the check or if she is the executor of op 's mother 's estate it sounds like the second line of the check is indeed referring to your aunt however from your description of the check it sounds like the second line is simply a designation of what the check is for rather than an additional payee i bet a probate attorney in your state could easily tell by simply looking at the check

stock prices are set by bidding in principle a seller will say i want $ 80 if he ca n't find anyone willing to buy at that price he 'll either decide not to sell after all or he 'll lower his price likewise a buyer will say i 'll pay $ 70 if he ca n't find anyone willing to pay that price he 'll either decide not to buy or he 'll increase his price for most stocks there are many buyers and many sellers all the time so there 's a constant the typical small investor has very little control of the price you say i want to buy 10 shares of xyz corporation and my maximum price is $ 20 if the current trending price is below $ 20 your broker will buy it for you if not he wo n't you normally have some time limit on the order so if the price falls within your range within that time period your broker will buy that is your choice is basically to buy or not buy or sell or not sell at the current price you have little opportunity to really negotiate a better price if you have a significant percentage of a company 's total stock different story in real life most stocks are being traded constantly so buyers and sellers both have a pretty good idea of the current price if the last sale was ten minutes ago for $ 20 it 's unlikely anyone 's going to now bid $ 100 they 're going to bid $ or $ or some such if the last sale was for $ 20 and your broker really came to the floor and offered to buy for $ 100 i suppose someone would sell to him very quickly before he realized what an outrageous price this was i use td ameritrade and on their web site if i give a price limit on a buy that 's more than a small percentage above the last sale they reject it as an error i forget the exact number but they wo n't even accept a bid of $ 80 if the stock is going for $ 40 they might accept $ 41 or $ 42 something like that

a long time ago in a galaxy far far away rollover iras were used for funds that came from were rolled over from a 401(k account or a 403(b account all that money including any earnings in the interim could be rolled over into a 401(k plan with a new employer etc   one could make a regular contribution to a rollover ira but once such a commingling of money occurred none of the money in the rollover ira could be rolled over into a 401(k account etc in those good old days when contributions to iras were made by paper check and deposit slip one had to write a letter to the rollover ira custodian certifying that the ira owner understood that the contribution would destroy forever the possibility of rolling over the money into another 401(k etc all this went by the a few years ago when the law changed and the distinction between rollover iras and ordinary traditional iras was eliminated commingling of ira contributions and rollover money from 401(k)s are permitted and the entire ira balance could be rolled over into a new 401(k plan provided the new plan accepted rollovers however the still persist like i too have iras that are still called rollover ira they all have commingled funds and if the law ever changes back none of those ira accounts would be eligible for rolling over into a new 401(k

this answer assumes based partly on your and some simplifying assumptions as i see it you have a few options get a mortgage to buy your sister out this avoids any ongoing involvement of your sister which may or may not be a good thing it means you will be paying interest to a bank or similar financial institution make an arrangement to buy the house in installments in combination with some kind of rent likely to be a complex option to set up buy the house using a loan from your sister potentially agree a private mortgage to protect your sister in the event you fail to pay if interest is paid then it is likely to attract tax simply pay your sister rent let her keep ownership of her half of the house either forever or until you have saved up the cash to buy her out rent is likely to attract tax whatever option you go with i would you get advice on any local legal tax issues and drawing up the contracts if you do go into an arrangement that keeps your sister involved make sure you discuss the what ifs upfront and build them into your agreement if you can't won't pay what happens can she insist that the house is sold and the proceeds split in some way can she rent our her half of the house to someone else

the biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation which is called risk the scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict price portfolio doubles and you need to consider risk one way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is sharpe ratio risk adjusted return or the related ratio one piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk but that is not telling the whole story when you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk you are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax $ 1000 an alternative to a single stock is to invest in an etf much lower risk which you can buy and hold for a long time and the price growth of an etf ex spy can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth fluctuation look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to spy for example ibm compare the beta of ibm and tsla and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like tesla over ibm what is the beta of your stock and how willing are you to accept that risk when you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk although you may reduce your absolute return this can not be done with a single stock but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant keep the grant shares and still effectively manage risk some years ago i had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants options in a company where i worked during the time i worked there their price varied between $ 30/share and < $ 1/share i was able to liquidate at $

i agree with the culture leading to the lack of creativity but that has nothing to do with the language   before the current iteration of the chinese government the chinese were some of the most people in the world the first to discover a ridiculously large number of technologies far before the western world would even come close to that level of scientific advancement   in addition i personally believe that the from the more classical of chinese history is mind beautiful in all regards equal to any western literature you compare it to   instead i think the reason that the current asian cultures have the tendency to cultivate a mentality has to do with the time period when china and the surrounding countries fell behind technologically for china this was due to them shutting out immigrants and trade altogether i 'm not as well read on the other countries histories   when they realized that they were completely helpless against the now friendly and later industrialized west there came a massive movement to adopt the technology   and because of this 1 2 generation single minded focus on adopting others creations china is now a superpower korea and japan and to a degree taiwan are competitive tech in the world and we even saw one of these countries become a threat internationally that had to be shut down with nuclear   the cost is that for a few generations there was no intent to create anything new only to catch up   and i think what we see now is a follow through of that mentality though i like to think that that is changing

let 's imagine an economy where 100 of wealth creation comes from existing financial assets and 0 comes from new wealth creation that would essentially be a dead economy i do n't think it matters what your philosophy on economics is that 's a bad outcome if you do n't agree with that point we 'll stop here note if you do n't think it 's bad for this to keep going higher japan is at about 80 and we know how they 're doing   if you agree 100 would be bad then we 're 70 of the way there in the us trump 's tax plan if enacted would push us even further the question we should be asking is what is a reasonable way to encourage new wealth creation rather than protect and preserve existing wealth for starters it makes little sense to have a preferential tax rate for capital gains dividends estates as compared to earned income even if you just hate taxes and want them all to be gone i think it 's fairly easy to say if we 're going to have taxes they should not favor income transfer from existing financial assets as compared to earned income   a much more reasonable way to approach this is to say we have a lot of concentration of financial assets in the top of wealth spectrum let 's just level the tax rate so that income from financial assets is taxes at a similar rate to income from work that 's not even an eat the rich proposal it 's just a eat everyone equally proposal all it would do is tax the very substantial gains in stocks at the same rate as the very median gains from working   the fact that taxing income from financial assets at the same rate as work is a controversial idea is to me of a government completely captured by wealthy interests

generally a diversified portfolio will give you a better overall return couple of factors that may address what you are looking at 1 correlation the correlation between your two funds is still very high it 's partially a function of how global economies are related and many companies are now multi national   it may help if you diversified into other types of products    2 diversification following up from before you may want to also look into diversifying into some bonds commodities reits etc   they will have a much smaller correlation with a total domestic stock fund 3 returns i 'm not sure if by dominate you mean that it has better overall returns but the point of diversification is to to get you the highest returns   it 's really the ability to limit the risk for the returns this really translates to limiting the volatility   this may mean that overall your max returns could be ie maybe vtsax   gives potential average returns between   a diversified portfolio may give you potential average returns of   a similar article debating the merits of smart beta etfs if you are curious hope that helps

fundamentally these are my opinions i am expressing even though i try to remain as factual as possible and have significantly modified my opinion over the years as a result of apparently factual information it 's still technically just opinion   gt my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value   by the way when i say capital it 's not generally just finance capital but all operational capital goods which includes factories and all means of production a certain amount of financing is needed to keep it operational and more is needed to increase the means of production to grow overall wealth   have you ever heard of the 's wiki basically you ca n't really push this ratio very far if consumer demand dries up then production will get cut back to meat demand overproduction of stuff they ca n't sell is not what they are in business for likewise is demand exceeds the capacity of production to keep up it pushes inflation which drives up cost to reduce demand so this ratio remains very nearly a constant even though this ratio was at historic highs in the 1970s and historic lows today   what happens when you artificially dry up labor returns through excessive supply side policies is that demand for production falls hence production is cut back to meet that demand this of course reduces employment and increases job competition which puts more downward on wages exacerbating the situation only once labor cost fall low enough it effectively subsidizes inefficient production methods which limits the falling wages at a reduced overall productivity note that this is under present circumstances not those of the 1970s this adaptive matching between production and demand insures that the ratio is never too far off of its historical averages even if productivity is driven well below its potential   more or less the same effect occurs for the opposite reason if capital return ratios are too low though with opposite effects on the inflation rate and such when consumer demand is high enough capital will pay whatever labor cost is required to meet that demand so long as it remains profitable enough i.e. they get a reasonable ratio of the market return consumer demand with sufficient capital profit margins is what drives full employment not the sheer volume of capital returns as present policies essentially assume yet you ca n't have a broad based consumer demand to drive employment without sufficient labor returns as those labor returns is what finances that demand needed to drive employment   so not only does labour and capital returns need to be balanced economics does not allow it to be unbalanced at least for long even if balancing requires the economy to shrink productivity to fall etc that is exactly what it will do to remain balanced no choice given no matter how draconian the regulations to force it this is true under purely economies of the past pure communism and even this is why i am a capitalist because nature gives me no choice but acceptance of that fact does not require me to have an ounce of tolerance for cronyism   the only thing we can do is not push this balance in either direction to destructive levels because destruction is what will happen for the balance to remain because so much of our productive capacity has been in productivity gains since the 1990s and wages and demand have as yet not matched these productivity gains we have a huge latent wealth capacity that continues to grow as we fail to take advantage of it so far our supply side policies have n't so much destroyed wealth and productivity rather it has prevented us from seeing the potential gains from the latent productivity growth from technologies over the few decades     the last part you mention about wealth capital needing to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value you are absolute 100 entirely correct perhaps even more than you know ever heard of planned obsolescence or the light bulb light bulb that link is a documentary on the issue that will make you mad we could almost certainly pay a flat 90 tax rate on everything and still not come close to what this issue cost us that 's not the only means this issue imposes cost but it is extreme    of course just because an appliance still works does n't mean people will not replace it with newer better models but the trash pile insures there is a much more limited secondary market for poorer people consumption debt cost is also a far bigger issue than people recognize debt to finance capital goods for production is fine as this feeds productivity and wealth in a manner that itself even as the debt is paid consumption debt is an entirely different beast creating a significant section of the population that feeds on peoples income without producing a thing only to let allow people to consume income they have n't earned yet   this generally falls under the category of rent seeking behavior yeah the lack real value creation turns my stomach that people will knowingly spend money on temporary non essential and such is all fine and dandy but renting our base appliances for a certain number of uses is outrageous in my book

buy low sell high the problem of course finding a crystal ball that will tell you when the highs and lows are going to happen you could for instance save your money in cash and wait for the occasional sharp drop but then you 've lost profits dividends from having that cash under the mattress all those years you were waiting about the closest i 've ever gotten to market timing and i think the closest anyone can get in real life is that i cut personal spending to the bone from 2008 to 2011 and invested every spare cent   but such opportunities only come along a few times in a lifetime the other thing is to avoid what a lot of people do which you might call anti timing   when the market is high they jump on the bandwagon then when it drops they panic sell and lose money

no having to borrow money does not necessarily mean a company will have a hard time paying the interest on it similarly having to take out a mortgage on a house does not mean a person will not be able to make their mortgage payments borrowing money can be a way to spend future money instead of present money at a cost of course a company might not have all that money at the moment but that in no way implies they wo n't have it in the future and as you to in your question where you talk about funding some plans a company might be able to grow itself possibly increasing future profits by borrowing money

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets it does seem strange that there is a correlation between government debt and the stock market   but i could see many reasons for the reaction   the downgrade by s&p may make it more expensive for the government to borrow money i.e. higher interest rates   this means it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money and the government will probably need to raise taxes to cover the cost of borrowing   rising taxes are not good for business   also many banks in the us hold us government debt   rising yields will push down the value of their holdings which in turn will reduce the value of us debt on the businesses balance sheets   this weakens the banks balance sheets   they may even start to unload us bonds why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating i do n't know   i think they have proven they are practically useless   that 's just my opinion   many though still think they are a credible ratings agency what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached theoretically the government has to stop borrowing money once the debt ceiling is reached   if this occurs and the government does not raise the debt ceiling then the government faces three choices

contrary to what many people think credit card companies pass nearly all fraud costs via purchased goods onto the merchant who sells them as a result they stand a very high chance of getting the money from a fraudulent purchase of a specific purchased item back as they just chargeback the merchant who has to stomach the cost this is not the case for cash transactions obviously where as soon as the money leaves the atm fraudulently it is as good as gone as a result the risk profile of the two types of transaction is wildly different and the credit limits of each reflect this

think about it this way if the strike price is $ 200 and cost of the option is $ 0.05 $ 200 + $ 0.05 is $ that does not mean that the price of buying the option is more neither is the option writer going to pay you $ 70 to buy the contract   when you are buying options you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it   in case of the $ 115 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $   in case of the $ 130 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $ this is due to the fact that the chances of aapl going to hit $ 130 is less than the chance of aapl hitting $ 115 therefore option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price   long story short you do not pay for the strike price you only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in strike decrease if it is a put option strike price is just a number that you expect the stock or index to break i would suggest you to read up a little more on pricing from here

how can someone use the account number to withdraw money without my    consent they can use your account number to game your banks phone support and try to their way into your account banks have gotten very good at this but theoretically with just the address he lives in your name and a bad bank phone rep he could get into your business the account number would just be one more piece of information to lead with i have 1 savings and 3 checking accounts with the same bank would they be able to gain access to the other accounts dependent on how incompetent the bad bank rep i referenced above is sure but the odds are incredibly low and if anything were to happen the bank would be falling over itself to fix it and make so that you do n't sue for a whole crap ton more is there a more secure and still free option that i have overlooked opening up yet another checking account solely for accounts receivable and transfer to accounts payable would keep your financial records more transparent also banks are doing money transfer by email now so i do n't know how great that is for business transactions but in that instance you 're just giving out an email linked to a money receiving account instead of an actual account number paypal is also a pretty good eft middleman but their business practices have become shady in the past 5 years

my memory served me correctly i remember this because it was on my series 7 so that link is misleading if you are studying for the 7 here is the exception   gt transactions to which the rule is not applicable proposed finra rule consistent with the initial proposal finra rule provides that finra rule is not applicable to 1 the sale of securities where a prospectus or offering circular must be delivered and the securities are sold at the specific public offering price based on nasd and 2 a transaction in a non investment grade debt security with a that meets the conditions set forth in proposed finra rule which is described below   if you 're studying for the 7 you will know that every mutual fund sale requires the delivery of a prospectus

wow this is a bad article   this is a notional amount   eg   $ 500 m us equity fund in australia wants to hedge their us exposure    they buy a $ 500 m forward contract and roll it over quarterly   each quarter they settle on the difference let 's say $ 50 500k + depending on the way fx moves   what matters is the amount owed not the notional value   same goes for interest rates $ 1b bond fund could short the 10yr to lower interest rate sensitivity the end value is n't $ it 's whatever they owe on the difference at settlement   the issue of swap spreads or settlement liquidity is so much more important

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

i do n't know what country you live in or what the laws and practical circumstances of owning rental property there are but i own a rental property in the u.s. and i can tell you that there are a lot of headaches that go with it one maintenance you say you have to pay an annual fee of 2,400 for building maintenance does that cover all maintenance to the unit or only the exterior i mean here in the u.s. if you own a condo we call a unit like you describe a condo if you rent it it 's an apartment if you own it it 's a condo you typically pay an annual fee that cover maintenance from the walls out that is it covers maintenance to the exterior of the building the parking lot any common recreational areas like a swimming pool etc but it does n't cover interior maintenance if there 's a problem with interior wiring or plumbing or the carpet needs to be replaced or the place needs painting that 's up to you   with a rental unit those expenses can be substantial on my rental property sure most months the maintenance is zero things do n't break every month but if the furnace needs to be replaced or there 's a major plumbing problem it can cost thousands and you can get hit with lots of expenses while my place was vacant i turned the water heater down to save on utility expenses then a tenant moved in and complained that the water heater did n't work we sent a plumber out who quickly figured out that she did n't realize she had to turn the knob up then of course he had to hang around while the water heated up to make sure that was all it was it cost me umm i think $ 170 to have someone turn that knob but i probably saved over $ 15 on the gas bill by turning it down for the couple of months the place was empty two what happens when you get a bad tenant here in the u.s. theoretically you only have to give 3 days notice to evict a tenant who damages the property or fails to pay the rent but in practice they do n't leave then you have to go to court to get the police to throw them out when you contact the court they will schedule a hearing in a month or two if your case is clear cut like the tenant has n't paid the rent for two months or more you will win easily both times i 've had to do this the tenant did n't even bother to show up so i won by default so then you have a piece of paper saying the court orders them to leave you have to wait another month or two for the police to get around to actually going to the unit and ordering them out so say a tenant fails to pay the rent in real life you 're probably not going to evict someone for being a day or two late but let 's say you 're pretty hard about it and start eviction proceedings when they 're a month late there 's at least another two or three months before they 're actually going to be out of the place of course once you send them an eviction notice they 're not going to pay the rent any more so you have to go four five months with these people living in your property but not paying any rent on top of that some tenants do serious damage to the property it 's not theirs they do n't have much incentive to take care of it if you evict someone they may deliberately trash the place out of spite one tenant i had to evict did over $ 13,000 in damage so i 'm not saying do n't rent the place out what i am saying is be sure to include all your real costs in your calculation think of all the things that could go wrong as well as all the things that could go right

the article seems to focus more on individual external factors and seems to ignore social and cultural issues cultural behaviour at any age is almost all driven by peer groups and the messages and ideologies that peer groups share and believe   it appears that teens to early 20s these days are far more socially conservative along the lines of 1950s leave it to due to a lot of disasters their generations are experiencing most campuses and high schools have been putting in place policies that all drunk sex is rape for example and a very large number of boys have been kicked out of schools for having drunk sex with drunk girls and the girls complain months to years later based on rejection regret or being convinced by new friends to file the complaint heck our university has a new policy stating exactly that sex impaired by alcohol or drugs is considered sexual violence and being impaired by alcohol or drugs is no excuse for not being aware of the impairment of your partner it 's literally a race to the admin office whoever files first is the victim and the other is the rapist and filing even 5 minutes later is retaliation and makes the punishment worse for comparison the legal standard here is meaning unable to actively participate in the sexual activity or understand what you are doing not impairment which is vague and could be everything from a drink to a slight buzz to blackout drunk   we 're seeing yes means yes policies we 're seeing sex contracts pop up in response which of course takes all of the and out of it and so many people will not have sex that otherwise would have it 's really forcing sex into committed relationships by making casual sex too risky   then there 's cameras everywhere women getting without knowing especially by partners they do n't know and getting on porn sites again and risky   similar with if you are under 18 having a naked picture of yourself on your own phone can be illegal and child and sending it to somebody else can be very serious   then there 's drunk social media how much trouble have people gotten into from posting their activities on facebook twitter instagram how many jobs lost with that phone in your pocket and getting drunk what sorts of stupid things have people done that previous generations would have experienced and moved on but now kids can never live it down or forget   then there are ideology battles of the young like has n't been seen in a long time 3rd wave radical formerly known as man hating vs and and very public battles in this space all over social media   i think sex dating and drinking all fall into those social phenomena that the current young generation experience the driving part seems a little different perhaps costs perhaps has reduced the need for driving perhaps the convenience of uber and lyft perhaps better mass transportation infrastructure perhaps the movement to working from home perhaps even climate change or combinations thereof

a drip plan with the etf does just that it provides cash the dividends you are paid back to the fund manager who will accumulate all such reinvested dividends and proportionally buy more shares of stock in the etf most etfs will not do this without your approval as the dividends are taxed to you you must include them as income for that year if this is in a taxable account and therefore you should have the say on where the dividends go

1   you ignore dividends you can hold your 10 million shares and never sell them and still get cash to live on if the security pays dividends mcdonalds stock pays 3 in dividends a year if you owned 10 million shares of mcdonalds you would get 75,000 every three months i am sure you could live on 25,000 a month   2   enron was an energy company they sold energy and made a profit or rather were supposed to enron did n't make their money by selling stock mcdonalds makes their money by selling hamburgers and other food the income of a company comes from their customers not from selling stock   3   if you sold all of your 10 million shares within a short time frame it likely would drive the price of the stock down but you do not need a billion dollars to live on if you sold 1000 shares each month you would have plenty for buying cars and pizza selling 1000 shares may drive the price of the stock down for a minute or two but the rest of the transactions for that security made the same day would quickly obscure the effect you had on the stock   4   when you buy stock your money does not go to the company if i were to buy 100 shares of mcdonalds mcdonalds would not get $ money is usually paid to a market maker who in turn will use the cash to buy mcd from other individual shareholders presumably for less than a share

as i understand it the correct price is any point between the minimum the seller is willing to accept and the maximum the buyer is willing to pay   these values are influenced by a number of factors including market conditions cost of production and immediate need there 's also a sense of fairness and expectation that influences these numbers people do n't want to pay a much higher price or accept a much lower price than they think the other party should agree to   for example in the event of a sudden actual or anticipated shortage in some commodity consumer good say gasoline it would make sense for sellers to raise the price significantly in the short term consumers of gasoline are very price and most will pay more than double the usual price to obtain it this behavior is commonly seen as unfair on the part of the seller to the point that certain variations of it are illegal in some jurisdictions economists would describe it as rational   oddly people do n't seem to be as upset about buyers offering low prices in the event of a sudden increase in highly motivated sellers when people do tend to get upset is if the buyers have a profit motive they know the price decrease is temporary and are willing to buy and hold the asset to make a profit later even so it seems to me that it 's much rarer for such behavior to be illegal   the underlying objection as far as i can tell is to what is perceived as greed

i 'm sorry i should have said i was saying that sarcastically but those are the arguments which i suspect are being made   did not answer my question where 's my advocate in the negotiations   its doubtful that they would be among the hundreds thousands of lobbyists unless you are a corporation and you have one   should i believe the negotiators have my best interests at heart   i do n't think the negotiators have your or the country 's best interests at heart i think they barely even play lip service to it any more    's the point of negotiating a treaty that does n't have the people 's interests at heart      well look at all the things that are in ttip for example here in the us by government agencies tasked with enforcement of existing laws and recommending new ones the chemical industry has succeeded for the last 25 years or so at preventing a lot of needed regulation of a lot of demonstrably dangerous substances particularly a class of chemicals called tag    meanwhile europe has put into place much more stringent regulations based on the principle which requires that chemical industry prove some chemicals are safe to get them approved while the us the key issue is overcoming lobbyists and even chemicals which are clearly dangerous have to go through a lot of hoops before they are regulated and even when its shown to be extremely likely they are dangerous it is very difficult when lobbyists are there often regulators are political from the industries they are supposed to regulate there is no denying that having different regulations is complicated but what they are promoting as a solution is not a good approach    they are pushing for what they call regulatory which is basically the forcing of all environmental and chemical laws in a bunch of countries into the same publications it would overrule a lot of state laws involving things like fracking and food safety    instead of raising our standards to the european level they want to bring theirs down and get rid of the imo quite prudent principle which i think is incredibly stupid but people are not aware of this   i think has clearly been a high level decision some kind of agreement between the 5 media corporations that control virtually all us media to never cover some issues   to not cover those issues at all but in europe they have a similar problem just not quite as bad but there people make more of an effort to find out what s really happening also there are fewer   the us is known for massive levels of astroturfing in its online world   for example in the uk there is a lot of protesting because of the implicit goal of the ftas is to privatize public services although they deny it its right there in agreements like files framing public services as bad some kind of theft from companies and any small privatization into a permanent entitlement for that company to that market so its permanent even if its unsuccessful that s been disastrous to their john on ttip and nhs they are trying to us   how did it get this way in part its due to the failure of americans to seek out facts something people really have to do because there are forces spending a lot of effort into hiding them and trying to exploit positions of trust to create a dangerous false security   its a direct result of so much money in politics the so called stakeholders spend a lot of money and energy into getting candidates into office so then they expect something in return    this is related

what exactly is call protection is no normal for a cd    a callable cd or one without protection can be revoked before maturity by the issuer for example if interest rates drop they might recall the cd since they can borrow money at a lower rate a callable cd should offer a better return in exchange for this is first coupon date the first time it actually pays interest    yes given that the first coupon date is in 6 months and it 's semiannual is it fair to assume that this pays every six months    yes given that the maturity date is this is really a 15-year cd right    it depends cds can be resold on the market so it is at least a 15 year cd it could also be a 20 year cd originally issued in 2005 what does price ask mean it says 100 does that mean you buy in chunks of $ 100    yes more accurately they are $ 100 per cd   what is yield to worst ask is this the worst yield that this cd will return    the lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting 3.25 is the best yield i 've seen from something as stable as a cd would it be silly though to lock money up in an investment like this for 15 years      there is no way to really say without a crystal ball if you are n't willing to accept more risk and think that interest rates will remain at these historic lows for a long while then it is probably a good deal if you think interest rates are due to go up substantially then it is probably smarter to ladder your investments in shorter term cds in investment circles this is known as interest rate risk

the purpose of making sure you met the safe harbor was to avoid the penalty having achieved that goal the tax law allows you to wait until april 15th to pay the balance so do so   put enough money aside to make sure you can easily make that payment   i was in this exact situation a few years ago i planned my w4 to make the safe harbor and then slept easy even though the house settlement was in may and i did n't have to make the irs payment 11 months later in april

question are you saying that buying a call is better than buying a vertical spread regardless of fees or only because of fees if the former you are saying that buying a call and selling a vertical spread will always be profitable which effectively means you 're going short an out of the money call while that 's a good strategy it does n't guarantee profit and will lose money exactly when the vertical spread is a better strategy than buying the call outright the most direct answer to your question in comments if the stock goes down you lose less money with the vertical spread than you do with a simple call in return for this lower risk you give up gains if the stock goes above the higher calls strike price

when considering such a major life decision with such high potential costs and high potential rewards i encourage you to consider multiple different potential options even if loans were available they might not be the best option less debt and an engineering degree is better than more debt and an engineering degree both of which are likely better than your current debt and no engineering degree i encourage you to consider revisit your aid which is not just loans cut expenses consider alternative aid sources use your engineering student status to get a better paying job including more profitable summer employment check for methods to cut down the cost of your degree and double check your plans to make sure you have a long term plan that makes sense   the first issue raised in the comments is whether or not you are getting appropriate financial aid this does not just mean loans it includes grants and other forms of assistance   you should be getting in state tuition and by searching the tuition of unc i believe you are but for future readers you should make sure you are getting in state rates and it not there are options to return to a state where you would get in state tuition rates or look into the possibility of your study for one year until you meet in state funding requirements you should also ensure your fafsa information is correct including your income family situation whether or not you are an independent study as it sounds like you probably are etc this effects how many grants you get and if you are independent this changes maximum federal loan amounts see website for details   while you do n't say what your pay is the fact that you are working two jobs and having trouble making ends meet suggests either that you have a spending issue or that your jobs pay sucks and possibly both i 've been in both situations and there are methods for dealing with both if your spending is not very carefully controlled that 's a big issue i wo n't try to rehash all the personal finance advice about this but i will just warn that when you are desperate and you know there is n't enough money even if you spend perfectly there is a strong tendency to just give up and not even try because what 's the point learned is hell but it can be overcome with effort and tightly holding on to any of hope you find to do better each day if you are in a field like engineering or computing and some other fields though i am less personally familiar with the current employment climate in those there are usually companies who want to hire you as a paid intern or part time employee in the hopes of getting you when you graduate those last two semesters of undergrad are a technicality to employers they know it does n't really change your skill set much many companies are actually more interesting in hiring someone on who has n't finished the degree yet than getting someone recently post degree because they can get you cheaper and learn if this is a good match before they have to take the big risk of full time hiring you need to use this system to your advantage its hard when you feel destitute but talk with career councilors in your school your department advisor and/or main administrative staff in your main academic department make sure you are on the right mailing lists to see the job offers many schools require you to subscribe to one because at a school like unc it easily gets way too much traffic each day you need field relevant experience not just to finish the degree but to be able to really open up your job opportunities and earning potential do not be shy about directly calling emailing a contact who reaches out to your school looking for recent graduates and especially any mention of flexibility on early start for those who are almost finished you can say you are in your final year you are and even ask if they are open to working around a light school schedule while you finish up most can end up to be no but it does n't matter the recruiting contacts want to hire people so just reaching out early means you can follow up later once you get your degree and finances sorted out and you will have an even easier time getting that opportunity in technology and engineering the importance of summer internships can not be understated especially as you are now technically at the end of your degree in engineering and tech fields internships pay often very well do n't worry about it being the job of your dreams depending on your set of skills apply to insurance companies it departments in hospitals and banks even if you thought your coding skills in engineering were minimal and of course any paying position that might be more directly in your field of interest consider ones outside your immediate area or even the more national internships from the bigger name companies where possible it is not at all uncommon for tech and engineering internships for undergraduate students to pay $ + per hour even where most non degree jobs might only pay $ 8 and i 've seen as high as $ 40 per in the high cost of living markets depending on your skill set i know many people who were paid more as a student intern than they were previously paid as a full time professional employee many schools including unc charge different tuition for distance learning and satellite campuses and often also offer university approved online classes while this is not always a possibility for every student you should consider the options it could be that one of the final classes you need towards your degree can be taken at one of these other options with reduced tuition this is not always possible with all courses but is certainly true if you have any of those general education requirements to knock out also consider if any of those final requirements have test out options such as test alternatives again not always available but sometimes you can get class credit for a general education class for    finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money attend part time while working look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted inquire about scholarships and school emergency assistance while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options student loan forbearance while in school if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in skip a semester if necessary to save money if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet double check on credit expiration and degree requirements make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't inquire about other government and community based assistance being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you make sure your long term goal makes sense finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

sometimes what happens is that a creditor will hand over accounts to a collection agency for action and after a period of time it may be to yet another collection agency if the first one was not successful   theoretically this should not be cause to reset the date of collections on your bureau file but that very well could have happened here another instance when this happens is when someone contacts a creditor about a collection item on their report either to pay or dispute it   either way this the clock on that collection item so if a debt is old enough sometimes the best course of action is to let it go   if a debt has been in collections for 4 years let 's say and you decide to pay it off now your score is n't going to improve because you paid the collection enough to offset the effect of having it refreshed on your bureau file   besides creditors know how old the debt is so waiting 4 years to pay it is n't going to win you any favors in their eyes anyway to your question though it seems to me the most likely thing is that somehow the debt was refreshed through some action by the creditor or one of the agencies assigned to collect on it i hope this helps good luck

bookkeeping and double entry accounting is really designed for tracking the finances of a single entity it sounds like you 're trying to use it to keep multiple entities information which may somewhat work but is n't really going to be the easiest to understand here 's a few approaches in this approach the books are entirely from your perspective so if you 're holding onto money that really belongs to your kids then what you 've done is you 're taking a loan from them this means that you should record it as a liability on your books if you received $ 300 of which $ 100 was actually yours $ 100 belongs to kid 1 and thus is a loan from him and $ 100 belongs to kid 2 and thus is a loan from her you 'd record it just that way note that you only received $ 100 of income since that 's the only money that 's yours and the other $ 200 you 're only holding on behalf of your kids when you give the money to your kids or spend it on their behalf then you debit the liability accordingly and credit the petty cash or other account you spent it from if you wanted to do this in excruciating detail then your kids could each have their own set of books in which they would see a transfer from their own income garage sale account into their assets held by parents account for this you just each of your asset accounts into subaccounts tracking how much money each of you has in it this lets you treat the whole family as one single entity sharing in the income expenses etc it lets you see the whole pool of money as being the family 's but also lets you track internally some value of assets for each person whenever you spend money you need to record which subaccount it came from and it could be more challenging if you actually need to record income or expenses separately per person for some sort of tax reasons say unless you also break up each income and expense account per person as well in which case it may be easier just to have each person keep their entirely separate set of books i do n't see a whole lot of advantages but i 'll mention it because you suggested using equity accounts equity is designed for tracking how much capital each investor contributes to the entity and for tracking a household it can be hard for that to make a lot of sense though i suppose it can be done from a math perspective equity is treated exactly like liabilities in the accounting equation so you could end up using it a lot like in my approach 1 where equity represents how much you owe each of the kids but in that case i 'd find it simpler to just go ahead and treat them as liabilities but if it makes you feel better to just use the word equity rather than liability to represent that the kids are investing in the household or the like go right ahead if you 're going to look at the books from your perspective and the kids as investing in it the transaction would look like this and it 's really all handled in the same way an approach 1 if on the other hand you really want the books to represent the family then you 'd need to have the family 's books really look more like a partnership this is getting a bit out of my league but i 'd imagine it 'd be something like this that is to say the family make the sale and has the money and the shareholders could see it as such but do n't have any obvious direct claim to the money since there has n't been a distribution to them yet any assets would just be assumed to be split three ways if it 's an equal partnership then when being spent the entity would have an expense transaction of dividend or the like where it distributes the money to the shareholders so that they could do something with it alternatively you 'd just have the capital be contributed and then any income would have to be handled on the individual books of the investors involved as it would represent that they make the money and then contributed it to the family books this approach seems much more complicated than i 'd want to do myself though

ugh sorry + finance is pretty to actual information sharing   taxi medallions licenses are heavily financed using debt principally in the form of commercial loans the structure of these loans is usually interest only 3 year balloon with borrowers qualified on a 40 year amortization period sound familiar i 'll give you a hint rhymes with the loans then get chopped up and to local community lenders who are told that the prices never go down because supply side monopoly and then they happily up the concentration of taxi financing in their lending portfolios   your observation is uber lyft sidecar all that shit comes into the picture and there 's no hail so they 're not really taxis meaning they skirt regulation and to make matters worse they are also heavily financed through vc pe short term bank debt and they use that financing to do what not operations instead they just lower their prices and usually below that of traditional cabs it 's an artificially deflated price designed to hook folks on the service and then when they start not being able to subsidize their prices anymore they 'll raise em back up but consumers do n't care about that in the short run   why does any of this matter because when the e collective cited above comes in and creates stiff competition demand for medallion falls because cab drivers would rather go work for uber they do n't need to license their right to drive from a cab fleet anymore and also demand for cabs themselves falls because people would rather take the cheaper alternative that causes the cost of medallions to fall which = price correction and that 's bad because it 's not the guys originating and these loans who are on the hook effectively sold off their share of the loan to other lenders community banks and cashed out instead you 're looking at mom and pop banks who are now on the hook for these loans where the value of the loan grossly exceeds the value of the collateral the medallion the thing they were supposed to partially finance   this is the same phenomenon as what happened in 08 real estate prices experience a substantial price correction because of well a bunch of shit but let 's just say that it had to do with the financing arrangements that made real estate safe in the first place + shitty loan underwriting standards all of a sudden you had people with 500 k houses that they took out a 1.2 m mortgage for rational actors true to their word just walked away from the house just packed up their shit and moved somewhere else and just said to the bank here 's the keys i ca n't afford this shit and the bank ca n't take any of their stuff because the mortgage terms were essentially for the value of the collateral so now you have all these banks that are short on liquid assets they have residential properties but nobody 's buying at least not at the prices that they need to get the return on their investment   this is all a really long way of saying this if there is a mass price correction caused by uber it 's going to be mom and pop banks on the hook for the loans borrowers will flee en masse to uber et al while banks will experience serious liquidity issues you 're right that uber is doing something great by forcing taxi cabs into a non monopolistic situation but the first step needs to be unwinding the debt on these loans otherwise you 're looking at a mini market crash that could be disastrous for grandma and grandpa in county they 're not going and banking at citi or they 're banking at shitty little mom and pop banks that have no idea what they 're being sold

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

market makers traders and value investors would be who i 'd suspect for buying the stock that is declining some companies stocks can come down considerably which could make some speculators buy the stock at the lower price thinking it may bounce back soon short sellers are out to sell borrowed stocks that if the stock is in free fall unless the person that shorted wants to close the position they would let it ride worthless stocks are a bit of a special case and quite different than the crash of 1929 where various blue chip stocks like those of the dow jones had severe declines thus the companies going down would be like apple coca cola and other large companies that people would be shocked to see come down so much yet there are some examples in recent history if one remembers enron or worldcom stocks getting delisted tend to cause some selling and there are some speculators may buy the stock believing that the shares may be worth something only to lose the money possibly as one could look at the bankrupt cases of airlines and car companies to study some recent cases here circuit breakers are worth noting as these are cases when trading may be halted because of a big swing in prices that it is believed stopping the market may cause things to settle down

the uptick rule is gone but it was in 2010 applied to all publicly traded equities under the terms of the rule a circuit breaker would be triggered if a stock falls by 10 or more in a single day at that point short selling would only be allowed if the price is above the current national best bid a restriction that would apply for the rest of the day and the whole of the following day derivatives are not yet restricted in such ways because of their nature requiring a short to increase supply however this latest rule widens options spreads during collapses because the exemption for hedging is now gone and what 's more a tool used by options market makers shorting the underlying to offset positive delta now has to go to the back of the selling line during a panic bonds are not restricted because for one there is n't much interest in shorting because bonds usually do n't have enough variance to exceed the cost of borrowing and many do not trade frequently enough because even the cost to trade bonds is expensive so arranging a short in its entirety will be expensive   the preferred method to short a bond is with swaps swaptions etc

interest rates are at a record low and the government is printing money you can get a fixed rate loan at a rate equal to inflation in a healthy economy unless you know that you are moving in < 5 years why would you expose yourself to interest rate risk when rates are about as close to zero as they can be if your thought with respect to mitigating interest rate risk is what 's the big deal i 'll just refinance think again because in a market where rates are climbing you may not be able to refinance at the ltv that you 'll have in 5 7 years   from 1974 1991 30 year mortgages never fell below 9 and were over 12 from 1979 to 1985 think about what those kinds of rates which reduce a new homeowner 's buying power by over 40 would do to your homes value

he sounds like a very bad salesman and i should know because i was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $ 200 to $ 10k now i had a clear goal which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible but i did n't do that by making customers uncomfortable each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for   for example the $ 200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told you look great on that bike can i ring you up whereas the interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options   the $ 200 bike customer wo n't have very sophisticated questions although i could give a lecture on so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy   on the other hand we are building a relationship with the which will include detailed fitting sessions and time consuming mechanical service   while i also want to close a high priced sale it will take several visits to prove both i have the right bike and this is the best shop but no matter what you were buying i was always pleasant and and my customers left happy    specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics the problem is the competition with internet sales   often customers will have only 2 criteria the model and the price and if a shop does not meet both the customer walks right out    possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop you fall into the category of internet buyer   one thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we was n't going to honor this price if you came back   occasionally there would be an internet buyer and i showed no even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop   i would mention a competitive price and if he bought it great and if not that 's just business    as for the buyer i would treat these tactics with a certain   i would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if i could kick the tires an user car saying    i suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model and if the price is right and the shop is ethical so you wo n't get ripped off with garbage then you have to be ready to buy on the spot i will point out one horrible experience i had at a car dealership   i came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list   i was n't ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees   i asked will this be the price tomorrow and he said absolutely not   i told him so if i come in tomorrow morning your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes but that logic did not register with him    maybe he thought i was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me   i never came back but i did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation

for what it 's worth the distribution i 'm currently using is roughly with about 2/3 of the money sitting in my 401(k i should note that this is actually considered a moderately aggressive position i need to phone my advisor not a broker so they are n't biased toward things which are more profitable for them and check whether i 've gotten close enough to retirement that i should readjust those numbers could i do better maybe at higher risk and higher fees that would be likely to eat most of the improved returns or by spending far more time micromanaging my money than i have any interest in i 've validated this distribution using the various stochastic models and it seems to work well enough that i 'm generally content with it as i noted in a comment elsewhere many of us will want to get up into this range before we retire i figure that if i hit $ 1.8 m i can probably sustain my lifestyle solely on the income despite expected inflation and thus be safely covered for life so this is n't all that huge a chunk of cash by today 's standards cue duck i 'm rich i 'm wealthy i 'm comfortably well off $ 2 m these days is comfortably well off

i 'll answer this question why do intraday traders close their position at then end of day while most gains can be done overnight buy just before the market close and sell just after it opens is this observation true for other companies or is it specific to apple intraday traders often trade shares of a company using intraday leverage provided by their firm for every $ 5000 dollars they actually have they may be trading with $ 100,000 leverage as an example since a stock can also decrease in value substantially while the markets are closed intraday traders are not allowed to keep their highly leveraged positions opened probabilities fail in a random walk scenario and only one failure can bankrupt you and the firm

treat each position or partial position as a separate lot each time you open a position a new lot of shares is created if you sell the whole position then the lot is closed done but if you sell a partial quantity you need to create a new lot split the original lot into two the quantities in each are the amount sold and the amount remaining if you were to then buy a few more shares create a third lot if you then sell the entire position you 'll be closing out all the remaining lots this allows you to track each buy sell pairing for each lot simply calculate return based on cost and proceeds you ca n't derive an annualized number for all the lots as a group because there 's no common timeframe that they share if you wish to calculate your return over time on the whole series of trades consider using it treats these positions plus the cash they represent as a whole portfolio see my post in this thread how can i calculate a running return using xirr in a spreadsheet

i held shares in bind a small biotechnology company on the nasdaq that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016 there were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders with payments in 2016 and 2017 some payments have yet to occur the whole process is counter intuitive and full of both for tax preparation planning and receiving payments landmine 0 some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced   this would have been a huge mistake in the case of bind because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11   the amount of the liquidation payments was n't immediately because the company 's intellectual property had to be auctioned landmine 1 the large brokerages vanguard fidelity tda and others the distributions to shareholders on form 1099 distributed to both shareholders and the irs the bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility according to the tax code and to the irs website the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock rather than a dividend on the shareholder level a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation like any sale of stock the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock   vanguard 's error appeared on my own 1099 and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on   however l the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are not dividends the 1099s were the brokers responsibility landmine 2 many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016 it does not matter that the company 's shares were cancelled in 2016   according to the irs website when a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation gain is recognized once all of the shareholder 's stock basis is recovered a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received in particular shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation was n't complete   late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an end of year of 2016 overall capital gains for many causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere i 'm not going to carefully consider the following issues which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss landmine 3 surprisingly it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017 taken at face value the irs website 's statement a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received appears to apply to shareholders of record of august 30 2016 who receive the payouts even if they sold the shares after the record date   however to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs landmine 4 some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution the bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record aug 30 2016   those who bought shares of afterwards are out of luck landmine 5 according to the discussion on many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form more secure link showing brokers served here required to accept 2017 payments   to add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal over whether the trustee is able to require this form worse shareholders report difficulty getting brokers required cooperation in submitting this form landmine 6 hopefully there are no more boom disclaimer i am not a tax professional consult the tax code treasury regulations irs publications when preparing your taxes   they are more trustworthy than accountants or at least more trustworthy than good ones

there is not one right way it depends on the level of detail that you need one way would be create the following accounts when you pay the phone bill when you are paid with the reimbursement that is when you pay the phone bill you must debit both phone expense to record the expense and also reimbursements due to record the fact that someone now owes you money if it 's useful you could add another layer of complexity when you receive the bill you have a liability and when you pay it you discharge that liability whether that 's worth keeping track of depends i never do for month to month bills afterthought i see another poster says that your method is incorrect because a reimbursement is not salary technically true though that problem could be fixed by the account to something like income from employer the more serious problem i see is that you are reversing the phone expense when you are reimbursed so at the end of the year you will show total phone expense as $ 0 this is clearly not correct you did have phone expenses they were just reimbursed you really are treating the expense account as an asset account phone expenses due to be reimbursed by employer

its pretty much always a positive to have large institutional investors here 's a few cases where i can see an argument against large institutional investors in recent years we 've seen corporate raiders and institutional investors that tend to influence management in ways that are focused on short term gain they 'll often go for board seats and disrupt the existing management team it can serve as a distraction and really hurt morale institutional investors also have rules in their prospectus that they are required to abide by for example some institutional investors will not hold on to stock below $ 5 this really affected major banking stocks some of which ended up doing reverse stock splits to keep their share price high institutional investors will also setup specific funds that require a stock to be listed as part of an index i.e. the spy djia etc when a stock is removed from an index big investors leave quickly and the share price suffers   in recent months companies like apple have made their share price more affordable to attract retail investors it gives an opportunity for retail to feel even more connected to the company i 'm not sure how much this affects overall sales generally a good stock should be able to attract both retail and institutional investors if there 's not a good mix then its usually a sign that somethings

there seems to be a common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns what evidence exists for or against this first off even if the markets were entirely random there would be individual investors that would consistently beat the market throughout their lifetime entirely by luck   there are just so many people this is a statistical certainty   so let 's talk about evidence of beating the market due to persistent skill i should hedge by saying there is n't a lot of good data here as most understandably most individual investors do n't give out their investment information but there are some ok datasets   there is weak evidence for instance that the best individual investors keep outperforming and interestingly that the trading of individual investors can predict future market movements   though the evidence is more clear that individual investors make a lot of mistakes and that these winning portfolios are not from commonly available strategies and involve portfolios that are much riskier than most   would recommend is there really no investment strategy that would make it likely for this investor to consistently outperform her benchmark there are so many papers many reasonable even out there about how to outperform benchmarks especially risk adjusted basis   not too mention some advisers with great track records and a sea of questionable websites   you can even copy most of what buffet does if you want remember though that the average investor by definition makes the average market return and then pays fees on top of that   if there is a strategy out there that is obviously better than the market and a bunch of people start doing it it quickly becomes expensive to do and becomes part the market   if there was a proven easy to implement way to beat the market everyone would do it and it would be the market so why is it that on this site or elsewhere whenever an active trading strategy is discussed that potentially beats the market there is always a claim that it probably wo n't work to start with there are a large number of clearly bad ideas posed here and elsewhere   sometimes though the ideas might be good and may even have a good chance to beat the market   like so many of the portfolios that beat the market though and they add a lot of uncertainty and in particular for this personal finance site risk that the person will not be able to live comfortably in retirement there is so much uncertainty in the market and that is why there will always be people that consistently outperform the market but at the same time why there will be few if any strategies that will outperform consistently with any certainty

mortgage qualification is typically done based on pretax income to keep the math easy let 's assume $ 10k month gross   a well written loan allows 28 or $ 2800 to be used for the mortgage and property tax property tax varies but 1 is the average of the 2 states mentioned this results in $ property or $ tax leaving $ note here op stated $ 750 k house   $ will finance $ 450 k at years $ will finance $ 300 k at 3.5 let me pause here facts are most important to make these decisions unless you 're clear on gross income which may be higher the constraints above quickly come into play   once the numbers are spelled out you may find that you are qualified to only borrow $ 350 k based on a 30 year note nathan 's $ 2500 payment was correct but for the mortgage only add property tax and you 'd be at $ you 'd need a gross $ to meet the 28 rule   the above discussion would render any further thoughts of mine moot

he did n't sell in the normal way that most people think of when they hear the term sell he engaged in a perfectly legitimate technique known as short selling in which he borrows shares from his broker and sells them immediately he 's betting that the price of the stock will drop so he can buy them back at a lower price to return the borrowed shares back to his broker he gets to pocket the difference he had about $ 37,000 of cash in his account since he borrowed shares and sold them immediately at $ 2/share he got $ 16,800 in cash and owed his broker 8400 shares so his net purchasing power at the time of the short sale was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 4800 shares $ 2/share as the price of the stock changes his purchasing power will change according to this equation he 's allowed to continue to borrow these 8400 shares as long as his purchasing power remains above 0 that is the broker requires him to have enough cash on hand to buy back all of his borrowed shares at any given moment if his purchasing power ever goes negative he 'll be subject to a margin call the broker will make him either deposit cash into his account or close his positions sell long positions or buy back short positions until it 's positive again the stock jumped up to $ the next morning before the market opened during before hours trading his purchasing power at that time was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 8400 shares $ = since his purchasing power was negative he was subject to a margin call by the time he got out he had to pay $ to buy back the 8400 shares that he borrowed making his purchasing power this $ was money that he borrowed from his broker to buy back the shares to fulfill his margin call his huge loss was from borrowing shares from his broker note that his maximum potential loss is unlimited since there is no limit to how much a stock can grow evidently he failed to grasp the most important concept of short selling which is that he 's borrowing stock from his broker and he 's obligated to give that stock back whenever his broker wants no matter what it costs him to fulfill that obligation

you can be a great ceo without knowing anything about technology   however right now there are a lot of businesses going through level creative destruction due to technology in those contexts you need the technological expertise as well as the leadership   you would n't seriously suggest a ceo does n't need to know anything about finance because that 's what their cfo is for in this context technology is just as vital   the strength of the team will definitely fill in for missing skill sets if what it was just about understanding how technology works or even understanding statistics i think you can totally rely on the team to fill that in   however ceo 's do need to understand their business in this context it is a need thing not a want thing if the business were n't transforming in some massive fashion they could lean on understanding the past of the business and use it to extrapolate about the present amp the future that is n't the case here certainly i would n't expect the ceo to match their cto for technical understanding skills if you ca n't lead people who are more competent then you you 've got no business with the job it 's about the understanding of the business

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

yes you can have a buy to let mortgage on a rental property at the same time as a residential mortgage on your own property a lot of landlords do this i would n't go expecting your rental property to contribute much to paying off your residential mortgage most of it will go on the various costs and fees of renting out a property not least the buy to let mortgage the main financial benefit in the uk of owning a rental property with a substantial mortgage on it is that the value of the property goes up in a rising market which it normally seems to be

it 's important to remember that upward trending things spend the vast majority of their time at all time highs intelligent well meaning people have been regularly saying the dow jones has been too expensive since about 2010 often because it was now at all time highs    sitting on the sidelines can end up just as expensive if not more so than avoiding big drops if you are worried about a large down swing straight after investing just drip it in over a period you feel comfortable with no one can really answer this better than that without more info on your risk tolerance and exactly what you want to invest in   worth noting that buying anything other than transaction free funds when split into small transactions also adds a lot more fees entry and exit in a uk isa for example split these over 12 months say and it will cost you £ 240 straight out of the gate 2 fund purchases per month for 12 months each and another £ 240 to exit before any holding fees from the isa platform that 's over 1 of your capital gone just to your stockbroker employing this strategy   both the products you mention are also quite high cost in ongoing charges so unless you have very high convictions about the management quality will also probably lag cheaper investment types over the long run as well due to the dire performance of virtually all higher cost active management over time

the majority of illegal immigrants do not work in the field of agriculture that being said work visas to fill needed niches such as field farm work can be applied for and permitted so that farmers can have the legal foreign workers they need allowed into the country given any legitimate demonstrated need for that industry the problem is that then these workers would be much more protected then a class of workers who are essentially illegal immigrants and who do work off the books and out of sight and management of the federal government 's ability to track them and if need be offer them actual protections as foreign workers on a visa work permit

it helps to put the numbers in terms of an asset say a bottle of wine costs 10 dollars but the price rises to 20 dollars a year later the price has risen 100 and your dollars have lost value whereas your ten used to be worth 100 of the price of bottle of wine they now are worth 50 of the risen price of a bottle of wine so they 've lost around 50 of their value divide the old price by the new inflated price to measure proportionally how much the old price is of the new price 10 divided by 20 is 1/2 or .50 or 50 you can then subtract the old price from the new in proportional terms to find how much value you 've lost 1 minus 1/2 or 1.00 minus .50 or 100 minus 50

the thing you need to keep in mind is that if you take on debt you need to have a plan to pay it off and execute on it   you also need to understand what your carrying cost is what you will pay in finance charges every month   there are times when you need to take on debt in order to be a productive person   for example in many places in the us you need a car in order to have a job   it 's ludicrous for someone to assert that you should n't take on any debt in order to get a reliable vehicle   that does n't mean you go out and lease the car that you can get on your income in this case i 'd say it 's a bit of a grey area   could you live in an apartment for a while   perhaps   many people would have a hard time living like that and it could affect your ability to perform at work   i would argue that buying a decent mattress to sleep on falls under the same category as getting a car so that you can work   you do n't want to be missing work because your back is in from sleeping on the floor or a worn out mattress as far as the rest of it goes it really depends on how fast you can pay it off   if you are looking at more than a few months 6 tops to pay off the purchase in full you should reassess   realize that the interest you are paying is increasing the cost of the furniture and act accordingly   as mentioned you can often get 0 financing for a limited period   understand that if you do n't pay off the entire balance in that period you will normally be retroactively charged interest on the entire starting amount and that interest rate will likely be quite high the problem with credit is when you start using it and continually growing the balance   it 's easy to keep saying that you will start paying it off later and the next thing you know you are buried   it 's not a big one time purchase by itself that normally gets people into trouble it 's continual spending beyond their means month after month

i 'm not an expert but here is my best hypothesis on microsoft 's and most other company 's cash flow statements they use the so called indirect method of accounting for cash flow from operations how that works is they start with net income at the top and then adjust it with line items for the various non cash activities that contributed to net income the key phrase is that these are accounting for the non cash activities that contribute to net income if the accounts receivable amount changes from something other than operating activity e.g. if they have to write off some receivables because they wo n't be paid the change did n't contribute to net income in the first place so does n't need to be reconciled on the cash flow statement

this will work as intended but there 's another point to consider in the us the tax rate on proceeds from stock sales is higher for short term holdings which are defined as held for less than one year both rates vary based on your income bracket numbers are for fiscal year 2014 filing as single the difference between short and long term capital gains tax in the us is a minimum of ten percentage points and works out to 15 percentage points on average this is substantial if you wo n't be reporting much income the year you move to the us say because you only worked for a portion of the year it is decidedly to your advantage to wait and sell the stocks in the us to get that sweet 0 rate at a minimum you should hold the position for a year if you sell and rebuy from a tax optimization perspective two caveats

i 'm not an expert but here 's my $ 0.02 deductions for business expenses are subject to the 2 rule in other words you can only deduct that which exceeds 2 of your agi adjusted gross income for example say you have an agi of $ 50,000 and you buy a laptop that costs $ 800 you wo n't get a write off from that because 2 of $ 50,000 is $ 1,000 and you can only deduct business related expenses in excess of that $ 1,000 if you have an agi of $ 50,000 and buy a $ 2,000 laptop you can deduct a maximum of $ 1,000 $ 2,000 minus 2 of $ 50,000 is $ 2,000 $ 1,000 = $ 1,000 additionally you can write off the laptop only to the extent that you use it for business so in other words if you have an agi of $ 50,000 and buy that $ 2,000 laptop but only use it 50 for business you can only write off $ 500 theoretically they can ask for verification of the business use of your laptop a log or a diary would be what i would provide but i 'm not an irs agent

a few points yes as a rule it is better to pay down high interest accounts first as this will yield lower cost in the long run credit card balance transfers usually come at a cost typically something like 3 or $ 50 whichever is higher   so instead of transferring the debt maybe try purchasing items with your card instead of cash and using the cash to pay down the debt   this has the added benefit of giving you points or cash back on the card typically you wo n't get these for a balance transfer caveat only do this if you are very disciplined   it is very easy to run up high cc balances and forget to save the cash you should leave a bit of unused credit line on your credit cards in case of emergencies   i 'm you can use your high interest loans in the same way

congratulations on seeing your situation clearly that 's half the battle to prevent yourself from going back into debt you should get rid of any credit cards you have and close the accounts just use your debit card your post indicates you 're not the type to splurge and get stuff just because you want it so saving for a larger purchase and paying cash for it is probably something you 're willing to do contrary to popular belief you can live just fine without a credit card and without a credit score if you 're never going back into debt you do n't need a credit score buying a house is possible without one but is admittedly more work for you and for the underwriters because they ca n't just ask the fico god to bless you they have to actually see your finances and you have to actually have some i realize many folks will hate this advice but i am actually living it and life is pretty good if you 're in school look at how much you spend on food while on campus $ for lunch adds up to $ over a month m f four weeks buy groceries and pack a lunch if you can if your expenses can not be reduced anymore you 're going to have to get a job there is nothing wrong with slowing down your studies and working a job to get your income up above your expenses it stinks being a poor student but it stinks even more to be a poor student with a mountain of debt you 'll find that working a job does n't slow you down all that much tons of students work their way through school and graduate in plenty of time to get a good job   good luck to you you can do it

first i would like to say do not pay credit card companies in an attempt to improve your credit rating in my opinion it 's not worth the cash and not fair for the consumer there are many great resources online that give advice on how to improve your credit score you can even simulate what would happen to your score if you did this credit karma will give you your transunion credit score for free and offers a simulation calculator if you only have one credit card i would start off by applying for another simply because   $ 700 is such a small limit and to pay a $ 30 annual fee seems outrageous try applying with the bank where you hold your savings or checking account they are more likely to approve your application since they have a working relationship with you all in all i would not go out of my way and spend money i would not have spent otherwise just to increase my credit score to me this practice is counter intuitive you are allowed a free credit report from each bureau once annually you can get this from this wo n't include your credit score but it will let you see what banks see when they run your credit report in addition you should check it over for any errors or possible identity theft if there are errors you need to file a claim with the credit agency immediately edit from with 3 agencies to choose from you can alternate during the year to pull a different report every 4 months a couple every 2 here are some resources you can read up on improve your fico credit score top 5 credit misconceptions   9 fast fixes for your credit scores

the main question is how much money you want to make   with every transaction you   should calculate the real price as the price plus costs for example if you but 10 stock of £ 100 each and the transaction cost is £ 20 then the real cost of buying a single share is in fact buying price of stock + broker costs amount bought or £ 104 in this case   now you want to make a profit so calculate your desired profit margin you want to receive a sales price of buying price + profit margin + broker costs amount bought suppose that you 'd like 5 then you 'll need the price per stock of my example to increase to 100 + 5 + £ 40 10 = £ 109   so you it only becomes worth while if you feel confident that 's stock   will rise to that level read the yearly balance of that company to see if they do n't have any debt and are profitable look at their dividend earning history study the stock 's candle graphs of the last ten years or so to find out if there 's no seasonal effects and if the stock performs well overall get to know the company well you should only buy shares after doing your homework   but what about switching to another stock of actually it does n't matter since it 's best to separate transactions sell your 's stock when it has reached the desired profit margin or if it seems it is underperforming cut your losses make the calculations for 's shares without reference to 's and decide like that if it 's worth while to buy

i agree with joe that you seem to have your stuff together however i ca n't disagree more otherwise   you are getting a loan at such a cheap rate that it would be almost impossible to not substantially beat that rate over the next 15 20 years   you paying off your home early might give you warm fuzzy feeling but would make me   this is a money website   make money for our purposes let 's say your home is worth 500k you can get a fixed rate loan at 3 over 30 years and you can earn 7 on your investments per year   note that i have earned 12 on mine the past 15 years so i am being pretty conservative so let 's not get into your other stuff because that is fine   let 's focus just on that 500k your house interest only loan for the whole   the flip side is you pay off your house   your house could be worth 400 k in 30 years   probably not but neighborhood could decline house not kept up or whatever   your house is not a risk free investment   and it fluctuate in many areas more than the stock market   but let 's just say your area stays ok or normal   in 30 years you can expect your house to be worth somewhere between 700k to 1.5 million   let 's just say you did great with your house   guess what   at 1.5 million selling price you still lost 1.5 million because of your decision plus sunk your money into a less liquid option    let the bank take the risk on your house price   the warm fuzzy feeling will be there when you realize you could rebuy your house two times over in 6 7 years note i know my example does n't use your exact numbers   i am just showing what your true cost is of making a decision in the most extreme way   i am guessing you have great credit and might be able to find an all interest loan at 3   so not doing this is costing you 1.5 million over 30 years   given a lower home price after 30 years or a higher rate of return this easily be much more   if you earned 12 over the 30 year period you would be costing yourself 16 million do the math   now you are talking about doing something in between   which means you will basically have the same risk factors with less return

they are not basically holds independent pharmacies who do business with them at gun point contracts are structured in such a way which states a pharmacy must spend 90 95 of their monthly drug expenses on meaning they are free to inflate the prices as much as they want and the pharmacies ca n't do anything about it as they are contractually obligated to buy from them   furthermore the savings incentives they offer independent pharmacies are through rebate spend and they introduce really convoluted rebates further masking their actual price for cost of goods and also discouraging spending outside their website often the pharmacist does not have the time to keep track of what is on rebate and shopping around may put them in serious risk of loosing out on money or fines   you may wonder why pharmacies sign such unfavorable contracts the answer is there are n't many players in the industry who can provide all the drugs required to run a pharmacy the much cheaper alternate suppliers do not have the inventory and drug selection a pharmacy can shop around and there are some that do but the vast majority do not have the manpower to do so i will state i am no pharmacist but being around pharmacy owners they blame the wholesalers for how corrupt the system is

here is a quick and dirty explanation of options in a nutshell you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future they come in a few flavors   i 'll give you $ 100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of xyz for $ 10 more    per share than it is trading at today any time before    august 10th i 'll give you $ 100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of xyz from me    for $ 10 less per share than it is trading at today if i ask before august 10th there are also two main types based on the expiration behavior   there are lots of strategies that employ options too many to go into   two key uses are leverage buying call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock however with much higher risk of losing all of your investment instead of just some of it when the stock drops hedging if you already own the underlying stock put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding

yes your basic math is correct if your tax bracket never changes then either type of retirement account will end up in the same place assuming that there are no income restrictions that will limit your ability to contribute to the type of account you want now your job is to guess what your tax bracket will be each and every year for the next 3 or 4 decades events that will influence your bracket getting married having children buying a house selling a house paying for college the cost of medical care moving to a state with a different state tax structure of course that assumes that you do n't get a big bonus one year or that congress changes the tax brackets that is why many people have both types of retirement accounts roth and non roth

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

i do n't think there 's any law against having lots of bank accounts but what are you really gaining every new account is a paperwork hassle every new account is another target for con men who might steal your information and write bad checks or make phony credit card purchases in your name yes it 's not unreasonable to have a credit card or two that you keep for emergencies i 'd advise anyone with running up debts while having no idea how you will pay them off but to say that you might keep some credit available so that if you have a legitimate emergency like say your car breaks down and you do n't have the cash to fix it and you ca n't get to work without it you have some a fallback but do you really need ten credit cards for that sort of thing and how much credit are they giving you on each card i do n't know how the banks work this but i 'd think if they 're rational they 'd consider your total credit before giving you more   i have three credit cards that i use regularly two personal and one business and i find that a real pain to keep track of to make sure that i keep each one paid by the due date and to keep a handle on how much i owe and so forth i ca n't imagine trying to deal with ten i suppose you could just stuff all these cards in a drawer and only use them in case of emergency

it depends if cost of tuition + income forgone during studying years is less than your lifelong discounted incremental cash flows you receive thanks to your education then it is not worth it   if your studies are say 150 k and you forego another 60k y during 4 years of university you will need to make roughly 39 k more per year until you retire than you otherwise would have or more for your degree to be worth it i do n't see that as very realistic scenario for 90 of the people who get degrees    obviously cheaper more expensive degrees different discount rate assumptions and different salaries before during after university are different from person to person that 's why everyone has to make their own calculation and then decide whether or not to make such a risky investment in themselves

because compared to other professions there is   actuary is borderline the definition of a trade skill a high paid high skill trade but a trade none the less that is why the pay structure works the way it does   that is why it is mostly on the job training   all the things you think are appealing paid for passing tests high base pay are also directly related to the fact that there is a defined ceiling   sure some actuaries break through and make it to the top of organizations but guess what most of those that break through are no longer doing actuarial work and are not being promoted for their actuarial skills   they break through despite the trade nature not because of it

usually if the property is part of a strata then the water rates get sent to the owner each quarter to pay and the usage for the whole complex is paid by the strata so in this type of situation your tenant would not have to pay any water usage if for some reason as you mentioned your unit although part of a strata complex is individually and you receive a water bill for both water rates and water usage then the tenant would be liable to pay the water usage portion this can usually be arranged by either giving the tenant a copy of the water bill with the amount of usage payable or with the water company to separately sending the tenant the usage part of the bill as you had a real estate agent managing agent looking after your property at the time when the water usage was not being paid by the tenant it would have been their responsibility to either recoup this money from the tenant or organise with the water to send the usage part of the bill to the tenants that is part of the service you were paying them for you may need to check with fair trading in your state to find out who you should be going after for this money the tenant or the real estate agent in nsw you have 6 months after the lease has ended to take the tenants to tribunal to recoup owing money i do n't know how long it is after end your agreement with the real estate agent to pursue them   the case may be that you start with the tenant and if that does n't work then try with the real estate agent of course you may want to contact your old tenants first to see if they are reasonable and agree to back pay the water usage after you showing them copies of the water bills the tribunal will ask if you have tried to the matter first anyway then there is the matter of how much the water usage amounts to and whether it is worth chasing both the tenants and the real estate agent paying the tribunal application fees and taking time off work to attend the tribunal

you ca n't get there from here   this is n't the right data   consider the following five year history   2 16 32 14 1   that would give a 13 average annual return   now compare to 26 15 2 16   that would give a 4 average annual return    notice anything about those numbers   two of them are in both series   this is n't an accident   the first set of five numbers are actual stock market returns from the last five years while the latter five start three years earlier   the critical thing is that five years of returns are n't enough   you 'd need to know not just how you can handle a bull market but how you do in a bear market as well   because there will be bear markets    also consider whether average annual returns are what you want   consider what actually happens in the second set of numbers    but if you had had a steady 4 return you would have had a total return of 21 not the 8 that would have really happened   the point being that calculating from averages gives misleading results   this gets even worse if you remove money from your principal for living expenses every year    the usual way to compensate for that is to do a 70 bond mix or with five years of expenses in cash equivalent savings   with cash equivalents you wo n't even keep up with inflation   the stock bond mix might give you a 7 return after inflation   so the five years of expenses are more and more problematic as your nest egg shrinks   it 's better to live off the interest if you can   you do n't know how long you 'll live or how the market will do    from there it 's just about how much risk you want to take   a current nest egg of twenty times expenses might be enough but thirty times would be better   since the 1970s the stock market has n't had a long bad patch relative to inflation   maybe you could through with ten   but if the are like the 1970s you 'd be in trouble

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

japan has entered the next phase unlimited money printing   investors have been watching japan for over a decade now wondering what happens to a country that has a debt to gdp ratio of big   to realistically pay off we are starting to get the answer for review japan was the first country in the modern central banking era to begin a policy of   quantitative easing an unconventional form of monetary policy that is used when interest rates have already been lowered to the zero bound quantitative easing which involves the purchase of printed money to buy government bonds was widely viewed in japan as a failure but what most people do n't understand about japan 's early qe experiments is that they were very small less than $ 20 billion a month it took prime minister abe and boj governor   to ramp up asset purchases significantly in what was called      abe japan 's prime minister photographer bloomberg      the results of have been mixed but the stock market is certainly higher and the yen is certainly lower although it 's not clear that either of those two developments have really helped japan 's stock market is mostly foreign owned and the weaker yen did n't materially help the balance of trade still there are a lot of people who said that japan 's endless debt deflation would have been worse   without so it has remained firmly in place for five years   rapidly began to cause distortions as accelerated asset purchases caused the bank of japan to hold a huge percentage of outstanding government bonds at 40 and rising as well as being the majority holder of index etfs investors who traffic in have remarked that the market now functions very poorly since so much of the market is held by the boj it seems that will get worse not better last year the boj implemented a policy of yield curve targeting ostensibly to help the banks keeping the overnight rate negative but targeting a 10 year rate at zero percent the boj has been buying longer dated bonds for years but this was the first time it ever explicitly capped a rate at longer maturities some people wondered how committed the boj would be to maintain that cap in the event that were caught up in a global duration selloff which we experienced in the last two weeks   as 10-year yields rose above 0.10 last week the boj announced that it was prepared to buy an   unlimited amount of bonds to keep yields close to zero percent as you can imagine buying an unlimited amount of 10-year involves printing a theoretically unlimited amount of yen so the yen weakened significantly on the news   it still remains about ten percent stronger than it was in 2015 we are getting closer to the endgame for japan what happens if yields rise further what happens if the yen depreciates significantly how much could it depreciate could japan have a currency crisis what happens if the boj ends up owning the entire bond market these are the questions that investors are asking and nobody really knows the answers we are in territory i believe that a currency crisis is n't just possible it 's inevitable and it probably happens at about the time that the boj owns all or nearly all of the market and has to resort to   canceling the debt this sounds like a neat magic trick to make the debt go away but the laws of economics are not to be conned anything is possible a currency crash a bond market crash anything this is the very definition of debt monetization that resulted in hyperinflation in places like weimar germany and zimbabwe is japan different we shall see we will find out soon as japan has taken a major step in that direction   is the   author of all the evil of this world and the editor of the 10th man newsletter for economics subscribe here   forbes articles have 8 tracking cookies and 9 tracking scripts this comment has r

the usual rule of thumb is that you should start considering refinance when you can lower the effective interest rate by 1 or more if you 're now paying 4.7 this would mean you should be looking for loans at 3.7 or better to find something that 's really worth considering one exception is if the bank is willing to do an in place refinance with no closing costs and no points sometimes banks will offer this as a way of retaining customers who would otherwise be tempted to refinance elsewhere you should still shop around before accepting this kind of offer to make sure it really is your best option most banks offer calculators on their websites that will let you compare your current mortgage to a hypothetical new one feed the numbers in and it can tell you what the difference in payment size will be how long you need to keep the house before the savings have paid for the closing costs and what the actual savings will be if you sell the house in any given year or total savings if you do n't sell until after the mortgage is paid off remember that in addition to closing costs there are amortization effects in the early stages of a standard mortgage your money is mostly paying interest the amount paying down the principal increases over the life of the loan that 's another of the reasons you need to run the calculator refinancing resets that clock

as mentioned in the comments there are costs associated with owning living in an apartment first you have to pay maintenance charges on a monthly basis and perhaps also property tax find out the overall outgoings when you live in that apartment add the emi payments to the bank it should not be way higher than your current rent as an advantage you are getting an asset when you buy an apartment rent is a complete loss least financial terms so real estate is in general a good idea over paying rent as for the loan part personal loans are by far the most expensive of loans as they are in general unsecured loans but do check with your bank one way is to try and get a student loan which should be cheaper if you can borrow from family that is the best option you could return the money with perhaps bank fixed deposit rates it is better to pay family interest than bank if none of the options are workable then personal loan is something you need to look at with a clear goal to pay it off as soon as possible and try to take it in stages as an when you require it and if possible avoid taking all the at once

in my experience thanks to algorithmic trading the variation of the spread and the range of trading straight after a major data release will be as random as possible since we live in an age that if some pattern existed at these times hft firms would take out any opportunity within remember that some firms write algorithms to predict other algorithms and it is at times like those that this strategy would be most effective with regards to my own trading experience i have seen orders fill almost € 400 per contract outside of the quoted range but this is only in the most volatile market conditions generally speaking event investing around numbers like these are only for top wall street firms that can use co location servers and get a ping time to the exchange of less than also after a data release the market can surge plummet in either direction only to recover almost instantly and take out any stops that were in its path so generally i would say that slippage is extremely unpredictable in these cases because it is an advantage to hft firms to make it so and stop loss orders will only provide limited protection there is stop limit orders which allow you to specify a price limit that is acceptable on some markets and as far as i know provide a guaranteed stop loss fill for a price of course that could be worth looking at personally i do nt use ib   i hope this answer provides some helpful information and generally speaking super short term investing is for algorithms

i argued for a 15 rule of thumb here saving for retirement how much is enough though if you 'll let me i 'd refine the argument to use a rule of thumb to set your minimum savings then use monte carlo to stress test and look at any special circumstances and make a case to save more you 're right that the rule of thumb in tons of assumptions great list btw a typical scenario could include if any of those big assumptions do n't apply to you or you do n't want to rely on them you 'd have to re evaluate it sounds like you 're assuming 4 5 investment returns as you say that 's probably the big difference 4 5 is lower than most would assume 6 7 real return is maybe a middle of the road assumption and 8 is maybe an unrealistic one many of the assumptions you list such as married kids cost of living spouse 's income paying for college can maybe be bundled up into one assumption percentage of income you will spend set a percentage budget and as you go along stay within your means by sacrificing as required also smooth out income across layoffs and things by having an emergency fund by staying on budget as you go you can remove some of the the reason i think the rule of thumb is still good despite the assumptions is that i do n't think a more accurate number based on a lot of unpredictable guesses is really better and it may even be harmful if you use it to justify saving less or even if you use it to save far too much see also many most important assumptions are not predictable investment returns health care inflation personal health lifestyle creep changing spending needs desires irrational investment behavior i agree with you that for many scenarios and people 15 will not be enough though it 's a whole lot more than most save already in particular low investment returns over your time horizon will make 15 insufficient and some argue that low investment returns over the coming 30 years are likely without a doubt 20 or more is safer than 15 do consider that saving enough is not a binary thing if you save only 15 and it turns out that does n't completely replace your income it 's not like you 're out on the street you might have to retire a few years later or downsize your house or something but perhaps that is n't a catastrophe there 's a very personal question about how much to sacrifice now for less risk of sacrifice in the future maybe i 'd better qualify not a binary thing some savings rates certainly anything less than 10 make major sacrifices pretty likely so in that sense there is a binary distinction between plausible plan and denial also precise assumptions and calculations get a lot more useful as you approach retirement age you can pretty much answer the question is it reasonable to retire right now or could i retire in 5 years though with a retirement that could last 30 years plenty of unknowns will remain even then i think at age 20 or 30 though just saving 15 20 if you 're conservative and not spending too much time on a speculative analysis would be a sound decision that 's why i like the rule of thumb analysis paralysis saving nothing or near nothing is the real danger early in one 's career any plausible percentage is fine as long as you save as your life and you see what happens you can refine and correct adjusting your savings rate moving your retirement age around spending a little less or more the important thing earlier in life is to just get in the right ballpark

technically anyone who advises how you should spend or proportion your money is a financial adviser   a person that does it for money is a financial advisor difference in spelling financial advisors are people that basically build manage or advise on your portfolio   they have a little more institutional knowledge on how where to invest given your goals since they do it on a daily basis they may know a little more than you since they deal with many different assets stocks etfs mutual funds bonds insurances home health life reits options futures leaps etc there is risk in everything you do which is why what they propose is generally according to the risk level you want to assume   since you 're younger your risk level could be a little higher as you approach retirement your risk level will be lower   risk level should be associated with how likely you 're able to your assets if you lose it all as well as your likelihood to enjoy the fruits from your investments financial advisors are great however be careful about them   some are payed on commissions which are given money for investing in packages that they support   basically they could get paid $ $ for putting you in a losing situation   also be careful because some announce that they are fee based these advisers often receive fees as well as commissions   basically associate the term commission with conflict of interest so you want a fee only advisor which is n't persuaded to steer you wrong another thing worth noting is that some trading companies like e*trade has financial services that may be free depending how much money you have with them   generally $ 50 k is on the lower end to get a financial advisors   there has been corruption in the past where financial advisors are only given a limited number of accounts to manage that means they took the lower valued ones and basically ran them into the ground so they could get newer ones from the lot that were hopefully worth more the larger their portfolio the more $ $ they could make higher fees or more commissions and less work less accounts to have to deal with that 's subjective since the spread of the wealth was accross many markets

welcome to money se and thank you for your service   in general buying a house is wise if a the overall cost of ownership is less than the ongoing cost to rent in the area and b you plan to stay in that area for some time usually 7 + years   the va loan is a unique opportunity and i 'd recommend you make the most of it in my area i 've seen bank owned properties that had an owner occupied restriction 3 family homes that were beautiful and when the numbers were the owner would see enough rent on two units to pay the mortgage taxes and still have money for maintenance each situation is unique but some too good to be true deals are still out there

john bensin 's answer covers the math but i like the plain english examples of the theory from william   bernstein 's fine book the intelligent asset allocator   at the author 's web site you can find the complete chapter 1 and chapter 2 though not chapter 3 which is the one with the multiple coin toss portfolio example i want to highlight i 'll summarize bernstein 's multiple coin toss example here with some excerpts from the book   another top user @joetaxpayer has also written about the coin flip on his blog also mentioning bernstein 's book bernstein begins chapter 1 by describing an offer from a fictitious uncle fred imagine that you work for your rich but eccentric uncle fred he    decides to let you in on the company pension plan you must pick    ahead of time one of two investment choices for the duration of your    employment certificates of deposit with a 3 annualized rate of return or a most peculiar option at the end of each year uncle fred flips a coin heads you receive a 30 investment return for that year tails a    minus 10 loss for the year this will be referred to as    uncle fred ’s coin toss or simply the coin toss in effect choosing option 2 results in a higher expected return than option 1 but it is certainly riskier having a high standard deviation and being especially prone to a series of bad   chapters 1 and 2 continue to expand on the idea of risk and take a look at various assets markets over time   chapter 3 then begins by introducing the multiple coin toss example time passes you have spent several more years in the employ of your    uncle fred and have truly grown to dread the annual coin toss    sessions he makes you another offer at the end of each year    he will divide your pension account into two equal parts and conduct a    separate coin toss for each half there are four possible    outcomes    being handy with numbers you calculate that your annualized return    for this two coin toss sequence is which is nearly a full    percentage point higher than your previous expected return of    with only one coin toss even more amazingly you realize that your    risk has been reduced with the addition of two returns at the    mean of 10 your calculated standard deviation is now only as    opposed to 20 for the single coin toss dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases return while decreasing risk    if the second coin toss were perfectly inversely correlated    with the first and always gave the opposite result hence outcomes    1 and 4 above never occurring then our return would always be 10    in this case we would have a 10 annualized long term return with zero risk i hope that summarizes the example well   of course in the real world one of the tricks to building a good portfolio is finding assets that are n't well correlated and if you 're interested in more on the subject i suggest you check out his books including the four pillars of investing and read more about modern portfolio theory mpt

irs pub 521 has all the information you need expenses reimbursed if you are reimbursed for your expenses and you    use the cash method of accounting you can deduct your expenses either    in the year you paid them or in the year you received the    reimbursement if you use the cash method of accounting you can    choose to deduct the expenses in the year you are reimbursed even    though you paid the expenses in a different year see choosing when to    deduct next if you deduct your expenses and you receive the    reimbursement in a later year you must include the reimbursement in    your income on form 1040 line 21 this is not unusual anybody who moves near the end of the year can have this problem the 39 week time test also can be an issue that span over 2 tax years i would take the deduction for the expenses as soon a i could and then count the income in the later year if they pay me back if they do so before april 15th then i would put them on the same tax form to make things easier

only select items first i agree beware the factor any of those items may very well lead to greater consumption which will impact your worse than your bottom line and in this category chips and snacks in general you 'll typically get twice the size bag for the same price as supermarket for a large family this might work ok if one is interested in saving on grocery items the very first step is to get familiar with the unit cost often cents per ounce of most items you buy warehouse store or not this knowledge will make you a better buyer   in general the toiletries are cheaper than at the store but not as cheap as the big sale coupon cost at the supermarket or pharmacy cvs so if you pay attention you may always be stocked up from other sources all that said there are many items that easily cover our membership cost for costco the meat beef $ i can pay up to $ 18 at the supermarket or big 12 to the lb $ easily $ 15 at fish dept funny i buy the carrots mentioned they are less than half supermarket price per lb so i am ahead if we throw out the last 1/4 of the bag more often than not it 's used up 100   truth is everyone will have a different experience at these stores costco will refund membership up to the very end so why not try it and see if the visit is worth it last year i read and wrote a review of a book titled the paradox of choice the book 's premise was the diminishing return that come with too many things to choose from in my review i observed how a benefit of costco is the lack of choice there 's one or two brands for most items not dozens if you give this a bit of thought it 's actually a benefit

years ago a coworker to me how his tax guy got him a huge refund i told him my goal was to owe a couple thousand dollars and that i 'm glad i did n't have his guy   in the end your return should reflect the truth and a good tax guy will be little better than good tax software the bottom line is that a refund is money you lend the government interest free if you can owe a bit of money but avoid paying a penalty you 'll have gotten a free loan from uncle sam   given the fact that most it seems that way someone tell me if i 'm wrong families carry some balance on their credit cards they are paying out 12 or more on their highest interest debt lending the government even $ 1000 for the year comes at a cost if you file in time to get your refund by the end of march that 's an average 9 months you are out your money is $ 90 scale that up to $ 3000 the average refund and the max 24 rate i 've seen $ 540 lost   better to adjust your withholding and get the extra money each paycheck to pay off other debt   obviously for those with no debt their cost is minimal perhaps 1 but still better in your pocket for the year   if you pay in this money every paycheck only to feel good getting it back every march or april while paying 18 card interest every month that 's your choice and will support that decision or so it seems   edit the article steve linked titled big tax refunds really are good ignores this debt only focusing on the near zero rate banks offer now the article listed 8 reasons the author felt this way by the way the author is the chief tax officer jackson tax service inc which makes him a bit less than a disinterested third party and all 8 of his reasons are far from compelling in my opinion getting a $ 3,000 check is never a bad thing this was 1 and by now you know why i disagree next more than 75 percent of all individual taxpayers get refunds year after year it has been this way for decades it is unlikely that 75 percent of all taxpayers are all making bad financial decisions every year that 's enough rhetorical nonsense read the rest for yourself and decide if the next 6 reasons are any more compelling   keep in mind sellers of tax software or services have backed themselves into a corner with the largest refund claims i 'm sympathetic to the fact that we 'll shoot for no refund at all in fact our goal is for you to owe just $ 100 will not be their next campaign    edit 2 i gave this more thought as i started to write a near 1000 word post on this topic i came to find that 1 in 4 employees did not deposit enough in their 401(k to capture the full match this is the highest lost opportunity as the potential return is an instant 100 for matched deposits again it 's easy to dismiss the near zero bank rates but that 's not the alternative best use for the money

looking over some historical data i can not really a find a case where a stock went from $ to $ 1 it almost seem that once a stock crosses a minimum threshold the stock never goes back up is there any truth to that that would be a 200,000 increase in the per share value which would be extraordinary   when looking at stock returns you have to look at percentage returns not dollar returns   a gain of $ 1 would be minuscule for berkshire hathaway stock but would be astronomical for this stock if the company is making money should n't the stock go up not necessarily   the price of a stock is a measure of expected future performance not necessarily past performance   if the earnings had been more that the market expected then the price might go up but if the market sees it as an anomaly that wo n't continue then there may not be enough buyers to move the stock up looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy shares which right now would run be about $ 24 including to fee and sit on it if you can afford to lose all $ 24 then no it wo n't hurt   but i would n't expect that $ 24 to turn into anything higher than about $ 100   at best it might be an interesting learning experience

the home owner will knock 20 off the price of the house if the house is worth $ k then 20 is just a discount your landlord is offering   so your actual purchase price is $ 237 k and therefore a bank would have to lend you $ since the house is worth more than the loan you have equity   20 to be more accurate   another way to say is the bank only wants to loan you 80 of the value of the item securing the loan if you default on day one they can sell the house to somebody else for $ k and get a 20 return on their loan so this 20 you are worried about is n't actually money that anybody gives anybody else it is just a concept

cds spreads have little to do with the already issued debt itself cds spreads broadcast riskiness for current and future market participants   since existing debt is constantly bought and sold higher cds spreads mean the existing debt becomes ever more illiquid it means that those who do hold that debt can not price it accurately as a result of said illiquidity and can not sell it without taking a haircut   it also means that new debt can not be issued without the existing debt taking a haircut or being defaulted on because at least part of the new debt would ostensibly be used to pay off the old debt    if shares are used to securitize debt than a fall in those shares puts into question the ability to fully service that debt the collateral is the balance sheet of the debtor    mf global does n't issue their own currency they can not devalue their debt

i 'm currently working as an expat and my grandparents used to work overseas but retired to canada so you could say my family has done things completely the opposite of what you suggest however there are a number of very good reasons that my grandparents have done things the way we have and i think it 's worth sharing the rationale there low cost moving to high cost is a no brainer it 's not easy to do but many people are trying nonetheless however even they will be likely to stay in the high cost countries mostly because of health care also safety is a factor but social factors also matter firstly i think two key factors that have been overlooked are language and health most low cost countries speak different languages than high cost countries   this is n't a problem if you 're young but it becomes prohibitive if you are older even if you can manage it 's inconvenient in most countries you ca n't just walk down the street and do whatever you like you either have to keep a handy or restrict your activities to places where you can communicate in your native language your favorite sports channels american football etc might not be available because nobody there cares your favorite news channel or food even in grocery stores might not be so readily available all these reasons made living abroad undesirable for my grandparents but the big deal for them was healthcare   outside of the us every single developed economy has socialized healthcare to a large extent when you 're young it does n't really matter but when you are older it 's a constant concern there are two aspects to firstly if you are a citizen in a developed country there are significant financial benefits in the us there is also medicare medicaid but i do n't know how those work so i 'm not going to talk about that to staying in country when you retire even if the health care would be more it 's the government that 's paying secondly health care in low cost countries tends to either be cheap and poor quality and by poor quality i mean really really scary or expensive and almost as good as a developed country again high quality hospitals in low cost countries may still save you money but the nurses may not speak good english and the doctors may not have a great bed side manner in many low cost countries nobody calls the police because they know the cops do n't care or will never solve the problem i.e. they will arrive hours or days after it 's too late or the cops may even be in on it so basically you try to protect yourself from the inevitable robbery extortion hold up you name it but sooner or later something bad will happen with security guards and being younger it 's less of an issue but when you 're elderly especially if you look foreign and rich it 's definitely more dangerous many of my friends from low income countries try to for this reason and/or in combination with the political climate which is largely corrupt and full of problems so if you 're old why risk it stay somewhere safe

there are two parts to this firstly if you are also living in the property you have bought then you should not consider it to be an investment you need it to provide shelter and the market value is irrelevant unless until you decide to move of course if your move is forced at a time not of your choosing then if the market value has dropped you might lose out no one can accurately predict the housing market any more than they can predict interest rates on normal savings accounts the movement of the stock market etc   secondly if you just have a lump sum and you want to invest it safely the bank is one of the safest places to keep it it is protected underwritten by eu law assuming you are in the eu up to € 100,000 see for example here which is about the uk and brexit in particular but mentions the eu blanket protection the other things you could do with it buy property gold art works stocks and shares whatever thing you think will be least likely to lose value over time would not be protected in the same way

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

there are times that the simplest explanation or analysis is best   you show that for a time the pmi is $ and it 's the cost you will incur by sending $ 15,000 to the student loan instead of using it as a downpayment is 12 the loan is already costing you 4 i know a rounding error so in effect that $ 15,000 is costing 16 i doubt the student loan is even double digits   use the $ 15,000 toward the downpayment take the $ plus the $ per year saved on the mortgage payment and throw the $ towards the student loan this is the simple solution note $ 15000 at 4 for 30 years is a payment of $ or $ part of the pmi issue is that pmi gets removed when you hit 80 due to natural amortization i.e. the timeframe due to normal payments if you make extra payments and hit 80 a year after you close that 's nice but the bank will drag its feet and the appraisal at your cost may come back low then what   last without the s l interest rate and term i ca n't calculate the numbers the way your example showed but do n't mix up term and cash flow with actual cost say i owed my mom $ 50000 at zero interest and $ 500/mo payment sending $ 50 k would free up that $ 500/mo but there are better uses for that money such as high interest debt you propose to create 16 debt in your scenario

it 's not possible to determine whether you can expect a refund or whether you are claiming the right number of exemptions from the information given    if your wife were not working and you did not do independent contracting then the answer would be much simpler   however in this case we must also factor in how much your contracting brings in since you must pay income tax on that as well as medicare and probably social security whether you are filing jointly or separately and your wife 's income from her business    there are also other factors such as whether you 'll be claiming certain child care expenses and certain tax credits which may phase out depending on your income    if you can accurately estimate your total household income for the year and separate that into income from wages contracting and your wife 's business as well as your expenses for things like state and local income and property taxes then you can make a very reasonable estimate about your total tax burden including the self employment taxes on your non wage income and then determine whether you are having enough tax withheld from your paycheck   some people may find that they should have additional tax withheld to compensate for these expenses see irs w-4 line 6

gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end   means takes the shape of currency in this form we value gold in the same way we value the dollar it allows us to purchase things we want as a medium of exchange gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange for example i would be valuing one of gold to be worth a dog if i traded a dog for one of gold the value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction gold as an end is valued for its own sake a good example of this is a who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic gold possesses this is closer to the true value of gold than using it as a means but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor you know what i could use right now a block of gold said no one ever   but even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake this is usually done because gold provides a function for example if people no longer want to jewelry then a will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends to sum up gold has a perceived value for most people and an intrinsic value to a select few for the time being

china 's regulators it seems are on the attack chairman of the china banking regulatory commission announced recently that he 'd resign if he was n't able to discipline the banking system under his leadership the is stepping up scrutiny of the role of trust companies and other financial institutions in helping china 's banks circumvent lending restrictions   the people 's bank of china has also been on the offensive it has recently raised the cost of liquidity attacked riskier funding structures among smaller banks and discontinued a program that effectively one fifth of last year 's increase in lending   are the regulators finally getting serious about in credit creation the answer is an easy one yes if they 're willing to allow economic growth to slow substantially probably to 3 percent or less and no if they are n't     invented by   this is because there 's a big difference between china 's sustainable growth rate based on rising demand driven by household consumption and productive investment and its actual gdp growth rate which is boosted by massive lending to fund investment projects that are driven by the need to generate economic activity and employment   economists find it very difficult to formally acknowledge the difference between the two rates and many do n't even seem to recognize that it exists yet this only shows how confused economists are about gross domestic product more generally the confusion arises because a country 's gdp is not a measure of the value of goods and services it creates but rather a measure of economic activity in a market economy investment must create enough additional productive capacity to justify the expenditure if it does n't it must be written down to its true economic value this is why gdp is a reasonable proxy in a market economy for the value of goods and services produced   but in a command economy investment can be driven by factors other than the need to increase productivity such as boosting employment or local tax revenue what 's more loss making investments can be carried for decades before they 're amortized and insolvency can be ignored this means that gdp growth can overstate value creation for decades   that 's what has happened in china in the first quarter of 2017 china added debt equal to more than 40 percentage points of gdp an amount that has been growing year after year in 2011 the world economic forum predicted that china 's debt would increase by a worrying $ 20 trillion by 2020 by 2016 it had already increased by $ 22 trillion according to the most conservative estimates and at current rates it will increase by as much as $ 50 trillion by 2020 these numbers probably understate the reality   if all this debt has n't boosted china 's gdp growth to substantially more than its potential growth rate then what was the point and why has it proven so difficult for the government to rein it in it has promised to do so since 2012 yet credit growth has only accelerated reaching some of the highest levels ever seen for a developing country   the answer is that credit creation had to accelerate to boost gdp growth above the growth rate of productive capacity much if not most of china 's 6.5 percent gdp growth is simply an artificial boost in economic activity with no commensurate increase in the capacity to create goods and services it must be fully reversed once credit stops growing to make matters worse if high debt levels generate financial distress costs for the economy as already seems to be happening the amount that must be reversed will substantially exceed the original boost   once credit is under control china will have lower but healthier gdp growth rates if the economy rebalances most chinese might not even notice it would require that household income which has grown much more slowly than gdp for nearly three decades now grow faster so that the sharp slowdown in economic growth wo n't be matched by an equivalent slowdown in wage growth   clear thinking from leading voices in business economics politics foreign affairs culture and more share the view   enter your email   sign up but to manage this rebalancing requires substantial transfers of wealth from local governments to ordinary households to boost consumption this is why china has n't been able to control credit growth in the past the central government has had to fight off provincial vested interests who oppose any substantial transfer of wealth without these transfers slower gdp growth would mean higher unemployment   whether regulators can succeed in in credit creation this time is ultimately a political question and depends on the central government 's ability to force through necessary reforms until then as long as china has the debt capacity gdp growth rates will remain high but to see that as healthy is to miss the point completely

there are actual cases where this has occurred in cases where the beneficiary was suspected of knowing that the insured person was alive they have faced fraud charges in cases where they appeared to act in good faith the legal consequences are less severe but the likelihood of the insurance company to sue for their money back will depend on the circumstances and the amount of the payout one interesting case was a woman who abandoned her family and did n't reappear until 11 years later the family did n't know where she was so they probably wo n't end up paying back the relatively small $ 100,000 that they received

b already answered the first question i want to respond to the second and third i have heard the term the equity on your home is like a bank what does that mean i suppose i could borrow using the equity in my home as collateral yes you can borrow against the equity in your home what you should keep in mind is that you can only borrow against the amount that you 've paid on your house for example if you 've paid $ 100,000 against your house you can then borrow $ 100,000 assuming the value has n't changed the argument that this is a good deal misses the obvious alternative if you did n't spend that $ 100,000 on a house then you 'd still have it and would n't need to take out a loan at all of course equity still has value and you should consider it when doing the cost benefit analysis but make sure to compare your equity to savings you could have from renting are there any other general benefits that would drive me from paying $ 800 in rent to owning a house economically as you 'll notice from my remarks this is extremely situational it might be good to come up with a spreadsheet for your situation taking all of the costs into account and see if you end up better or worse also there 's nothing wrong with buying a house for non economic reasons if that 's what you want just make sure you 're aware of the real cost before you do it

let me see if i can restate your question are speculative investments more volatile subject to greater spikes and drops in pricing than are more long term investments which are defined by the predictability of their dividend returns the short answer is yes   however where it gets complicated is in deciding whether something is a speculative investment take your example of housing   people who buy a house as an investment either choose to rent it out so receive rent as dividend or live in it foregoing dividends   either way the scale of the investment is large and this is often the only direct investment that people manage themselves   for this reason houses are bound up in the sentimental value people attach to a home the difficulty of and moving elsewhere in search of cheaper housing or better employment or the sunk cost of debt that ca n't be recovered by a fire sale   such inertia can lead to sudden sell offs as critical inflection points are reached such as hoped for economic improvements fail to and cash needs become critical at different levels that is true of just about every investment driving price volatility is the ease of sale and the trade offs involved   a share that offers regular and dependable dividends even if its absolute value falls is going to be hung on to more frequently than those shares that suffer a similar decline but only offer a capital gain   for the latter the race is on to sell before the drop any remaining capital gain the investor may have experienced a house with a good tenant or a share with stable dividends will be kept in preference for the quick cash return of selling an asset that offers no such ongoing returns this would result visually in more curves for speculative shares while more stable shares are by periods of stability with moments of mania but i have to take your query further since you provide graphical evidence to support your thesis   your charts combine varying time scales different sample rates and different scales one of which is even a log scale   it becomes impossible to draw any sort of meaningful micro comparison unless they 're all presented using exactly the same criteria

google finance and yahoo finance would be a couple of sites you could use to look at rather broad market information   this would include the major us stock markets like the dow nasdaq s p 500 though also bond yields gold and oil can also be useful as depending on which area one works the specifics of what are important could vary   if you were working at a well known bond firm i 'd suspect that various bond benchmarks are likely to be known and watched rather than stock indices something else to consider here is what constitutes a finance practitioner as i 'd imagine several accountants and actuaries may not watch the market yet there could be several software developers working at hedge funds that do so that it is n't just a case of what kind of work but also what does the company do

typically you can chose in the transfer if you want to transfer in target currency or in source currency if you chose source currency the receiving bank for you in india does the conversion and charges the fees if you chose target currency the sending bank does the conversion and charges the fees the advantage is that they offer to generate a defined amount in the target currency so you can pay a bill exactly either way one of the two banks is going to charge you it absolutely depends on the banks which fee is higher from personal experience between europe and the us either direction mostly the receiving bank is cheaper incoming fees are set lower than outgoing i ca n't say for india you need to check with your bank

gt;when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people    i would never use the words corporations are people to describe this corporations are legal structures given a legal status by government to facilitate the cooperation of labor production and capital by having this legal status provided by government they can establish contracts and enforce them in return the corporation is subject to regulations and laws established by government    the simple fact of the matter is that if government did n't have the authority to provide certain legal statuses to corporations corporations would n't exist as such the relationship between corporations and government is rather than which the current republican party seems to think all we hear is how bad government is for business when businesses would not even exist without it we the people control the government if we wanted to we could nationalize every corporation in this country and end capitalism as we know it we basically did this in 2008 with the banks when capitalism was on it 's death bed corporations can live or die by the hand of government     that does n't sound like a process in which one concludes corporations are people my friends    gt;if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   romney never clarified what he meant by that statement and given the state of his campaign one has to wonder    gt;now if you set yourself up as inc   i have started my own business i can confirm that my personal expenses to keep me alive such as food car maintenance rent etc were not tax deductible but yet my day to day business expenses to keep it alive such as paper wages equipment etc were    edit basically i 'm just trying to say that the tax code treats corporations and people totally different as such corporations are people my friends is demonstrably false

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

it depends on what you 're talking about if this is for your retirement accounts like iras then absolutely not in your retirement accounts you should be broadly diversified not just between stocks but also other markets like bonds target retirement funds and solid conservative or moderate allocation funds are the best quick and dirty recommendation for those accounts since it 's for the long haul you want to be managing risk not chasing returns returns will happen over the 40 or so years they have to grow   now if you 're talking about a taxable stock account and you 've gotten past pf questions like am i saving enough for retirement and have i paid off my debt then the question becomes a little more murky   first yes you should be diversified the bulk of how a stock 's movement will be in keeping with how its sector moves so even a really great stock can get if its sector is going down diversification between several sectors will help balance that   however you will have some advantage in this sector knowing which products are good which products everybody in the industry is excited about is a huge advantage over other investors it 'll help you pick the ones that go up more when the sector goes up and down less when the sector goes down that over time and investments really adds up just remember that a good company and a good stock investment are not the same thing a great company can have a sky high valuation and if you buy it at that price you can sit there and watch your investment sink even as the company is growing and doing great things have patience know which companies are good and which are bad and wait for the price to come to you   one final note it also depends on what spot you are in if you 're a young guy looking looking to invest his first few thousand in the market then go for it on the other hand if you 're older and we 're talking about a couple hundred grand you 've got saved up then it 's a whole different ball of wax it that spot you 're back to managing risk and need to build a solid portfolio at a measured pace

the two factors that will hurt you the most is the age of the credit account and your available credit to debt ratio   removing an older account takes that account out of the equation of calculating your overall credit score which can hurt significantly especially if that is the only or one of just a couple of open credit lines you have available reducing your available credit will make your current debt look bigger than what it was before you closed your account going over a certain percentage for your debt to available credit can make you look less favorable to lenders as stated above closing a credit card does remove it from the credit utilization calculation which can raise your debt credit ratio it does not however affect the average age of credit cards even closed accounts stay on your credit report for ten years and are credited toward average age of cards when the closed credit card falls off your report only then will the average age of credit cards be recalculated and may i suggest getting your free credit report from it 's the only place considered official to receive your free annual credit report as told by the ftc going to other 3rd party sites to pull your credit report can risk your information being traded or sold edit to answer your second point there are numerous factors that banks and creditors will consider depending on the type of card you 're applying for the heavier the personal rewards cash back flyer miles discounts etc the bigger the stipulation some factors to consider are your income to debt ratio income to available credit ratio number of revolving lines of credit debt to available credit ratio available credit to debt ratio and whether or not you have sufficient equity and/or assets to cover both your debt and available credit they want to make sure that if you go crazy and max out all of your lines of credit that you are capable of paying it all back in a sufficient amount of time in other words your volatility as a debt consumer

remind walmart this is not 2007 when they were the biggest company in the country   but they are   their revenue is over quadruple that of amazons and in 2015 amazon had profits of million while walmart had   so yes i 'd say that amazon is somewhat of a decent competitor but wal mart is still very far ahead of amazon in all metrics including having a higher profit margin which means more leverage against amazon

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

my point was to collect as much tax revenue as possible without letting a loophole the collection of said taxes how ever that is accomplished is a possible solution i support if the end game eventually disallows paying your own corp in a different country to bring down your bottom line then so be it or maybe we should watch what corps categorize as expenses this is the magic of the internet people can kick ideas around you on the other hand had a virtual to find a small hole in my suggestion in which you could try to the discussion     instead of be anti intellectual and trying to find tiny flaws in someones suggestions why not make some of your own because last i checked shooting down suggestions while offering none of your own was not a productive practice

sounds like a terrible situation the only thing i can think of if you have the cash for it is to pay down enough of the mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses on the one hand this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now on the other hand every time you make an interest payment you are burning the smaller amount of money with no hope of seeing it back ever if you do n't have the cash or you find that just throwing away money then i would get out as fast as i can every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest if you sold at $ 300,000 you would have only a $ 30,000 debt to manage the total amount it would take to pay that off at anything resembling normal interest rates would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing of course if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on then you might want to hold on personally i would not make that bet all around a terrible situation i wish you lots of luck in resolving it

as far as i can tell the direct deposit option would require you to have a us bank account which you do n't have so wire transfer is your only option unless you can ask them to try something else like one of the cheaper money transfer services around the charges for wire transfers tend to be fairly significant typically low tens of usd depending on your relationship with the payer and the nature of the payment try to get them to send it with all charges paid so you actually receive the amount you are owed and they cover the charges

is there a reason you are focusing on stocks a portfolio of $ 4,000 in stocks alone will not give you much diversification and buying $ 40 of 100 stocks will not have enough impact to grow your portfolio in the way it sounds like you would like it to   have you considered using etfs

sell the house in the scenario you describe he is using the property as an investment with a $ 250 per month buy in this investment does n't make a return right now and when you add in the cost of dealing with the tenant even if he does n't have those cost now he will when they move is out of more than $ 250 a month and he has no direct knowledge that the value will definitely increase he would be better spent selling the house and putting the funds into an investment even a risky investment it will have less maintenance cost associated with the risky investment than the rental property   besides sitting on the property for 10 15 years would cost him 30 45k plus the cost of re renting the house when empty not to mention the inevitable increases in taxes over that time which will either increase his deficit or eat up the rent increase he is able to charge do n't take the loss on the sale just short sale it and take the money and invest one last thought an alternative is to creatively finance a sale take payments from a buyer until they can buy outright that will cover the full mortgage and get him the price he needs you can look up owner financing to find out more on how to do this hope this helps

you ca n't tell much by comparing tv 's in the store   there are so many variables that are n't controlled for   there 's no way to know if all the tv 's on display are properly set up and perfectly calibrated   having said that from your average viewing distance i think most people wo n't even be able to see much of a difference between most tv 's except maybe if you 're comparing the best of the best with the worst of the worst
