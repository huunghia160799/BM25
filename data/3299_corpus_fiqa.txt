the worth of a share of stocks may be defined as the present cash value of all future dividends and liquidations associated   without a crystal ball such worth may generally only be determined but even though it 's generally not possible to know the precise worth of a stock in time for such information to be useful it has a level of worth which is absolute and not unlikely market price is generally unaffected by people buying and selling the stock except insofar as activities in company stock affect a company 's ability to do business if a particular share of stock is worth $ 10 by the above measure but joe sells it to larry for $ 8 that means joe gives larry $ 2   if larry sells it to fred $ 12 fred gives larry $ 2   the only way fred can come out ahead is if he finds someone else to give him $ 2 or more   if fred can sell it to adam for $ 13 then adam will give fred $ 3 leaving fred $ 1 better off than he would be if he had n't bought the stock but adam will be $ 3 worse off the key point is that if you sell something for less than it 's worth or buy something for more that it 's worth you give money away   you might be able to convince other people to give you money in the same way you gave someone else money but fundamentally the money has been given away and it 's not coming back

the market does n't know or care why you bought   what you are asking is effectively this share went down in price after i bought is there anything i can do consider what you are asking for if there were anything you could do then no one would ever make a loss how do you suppose that would work

is there anyway to salvage my investment for short term no   if by salvage you mean get back as much as you paid the only way to salvage it is to wait as long as you consider short term and see if goes up again   if by salvage you mean get some money back the only thing you can do to guarantee that is sell it now   by doing so you guarantee that you will get neither more nor less than it is worth right now   either way there is nothing you can do other than sell the stock or hold it   the stock price went down   you ca n't make it go back up would it be better if i sell my stocks now and buy from other company or should i just wait for it 's price to go up again this depends on why you bought the stock and what you think it will do in the future   you said a family member persuaded you   does that family member still think the stock will go up again   if so do you still trust them you did n't even say what stock it is in your question so there 's no way anyone here can tell you whether it 's a good idea to sell it or not   even if you do say what stock it is all anyone can do is guess   if you want you could look the stock up on motley fool or other sites to see if analysts believe it will rise   there are lots of sources of information   but all you can do with that information is decide to sell the stock or not it may sound obvious but you should sell if you think the stock will go lower and hold it if you think it could still go back up   no one can tell you which of those things is going to happen

yes you could sell what you have and bet against others that the stock price will continue to fall within a period of time shorting   if you 're right your value goes up even though the stock price goes down this is a pretty darn risky bet to make   if you 're wrong there 's no limit to how much money you can owe   at least with stocks they can only fall to zero   when you short and the price goes up and up and up before the deadline you owe it and just as with stocks someone else has to agree to take the bet   if a stock is pretty obviously tanking its unlikely that someone would oppose your bet it 's probably pretty clear that i barely know what i 'm talking about but i was surprised not to see this listed among the answers

stocks go down and go back up that 's their nature why would you sell on a low point stocks are a long term investment if the company is still healthy it 's very likely you 'll be able to sell them with a profit if you wait long enough

it would be useful to forget about the initial price that you invested that loss happened it 's over and irreversible it 's a sunk cost and on it would only cause you to make worse decisions getting back from a loss is done exactly the same as growing an investment that did n't have such a loss you have x units of stock that 's currently priced $ that is your blank slate you need to decide wether you should hold that stock i.e. if $ is undervalued and likely to increase or it 's likely to fall further and you should sell it    the decision you make should be exactly the same as if you 'd bought it a bit earlier for $ 40

you should be worried you have made the mistake of entering an investment on the recommendation of family friend the last think you should do is make another mistake of just leaving it and hoping it will go up again your stock has dropped from its high of $ that means it has to go up over 60 just to reach the high of $ you are correct this may never happen or if it does it could take a long long time to get up to its previous highs what is the company doing to turn its fortunes around take a look at some other examples airways   this stock reached a high of around $ 6 in late 2007 after a nice uptrend over a year and a half it then dropped drastically at the start of the gfc and has since kept falling and is now priced at just $ 1.15 reported its first ever loss earlier this year but its problems were evident much earlier aapl apple inc.   aapl reach a high of just over $ 700 in september 2013 then dropped to around $ 400 and has recovered a bit to about $ 525 still 25 below its highs and looks to be at the start of another downtrend how long will it take aapl to get back to $ 700 more than 33 from its current price ten network holdings limited   ten reached a high of $ in late 2004 after a nice uptrend during 2004 it then started a steep journey downwards and is still going down it is now priced at just $ 0.25 a whopping 94 below its high it will have to increase by 1600 just to reach its high of $ which i think will never happen can a stock come back from a drastic downtrend yes it can it does n't always happen but a company can turn around and can reach and even surpass it previous highs the question is how and when will this happen how long will you keep your capital tied up in a stock that is going nowhere and has every chance of going further down the most important thing with any investment is to protect your current capital if you lose all your capital you can not make any new investments until you build up more capital that is why it is so important to have a risk management strategy and decide what is your get out point if things go against you before you get into any new investment have a stop loss i would get out of your investment before you lose more capital if you had set a stop loss at 20 off the stock 's last highs you would have gotten out at about $ 28 higher than the current share price of $ if you do further analysis on this company and find that it is improving its prospects and the stock price breaks up through its current ranging band then you can always buy back in however do you still want to be in the stock if it breaks the range band on the downside in this case who knows how low it can continue to go this is my opinion as others would have theirs and what i would do in your current situation with this stock

ignore sunk costs and look to future returns   although it feels like a loss to exit an investment from a loss position from a financial standpoint you should ignore the purchase price   if your money could be better invested somewhere else then move it there you should n't look at it as though you 'll be more financially secure because you waited longer for the stock to reach the purchase price   that 's psychological not financial some portion of your invested wealth is stuck in this particular stock   if it would take three months for the stock to get back to purchase price but only two months for an alternate investment to reach that same level then obviously faster growth is better   your goal is greater wealth not arbitrarily returning certain investments to their purchase price investments are just instrumental   you want more wealth   if an investment is not performing then ignore purchase price and costs   look at the reasonable expectations about an investment going forward

you probably bought the stock near the peak because it 's been up a lot lately that 's the easiest way to lose money you need to go back and do some basic research the stock appears to have been expensive around 75 why is that the stock seems to be in a comfortable level around 45 why is that maybe it 's too expensive around 45 based on the p e ratio or other measures maybe you should buy more at 45 where it is cheap even though 75 is too expensive the key is to study the stock where it is today 45 47 ask yourself what you would do at today 's price and today 's fundamentals that will also save you from paying 75 for a stock worth 45 and should save you from paying 45 for a stock if it is only worth 35

if you 're asking this question you probably are n't ready to be buying individual stock shares and may not be ready to be investing in the market at all   short term in the stock market is gambling pure and simple and gambling against professionals at that you can reduce your risk if you spend the amount of time and effort the pros do on it but if you are n't ready to accept losses you should n't be playing and if you are n't willing to bet it all on a single throw of the dice you should diversify and accept lower potential gain in exchange for lower risk standard advice index funds   the way an investor as opposed to a gambler deals with a stock price dropping or surging upward or not doing anything is to say that 's interesting given where it is now do i expect it to go up or down from here and do i think i have someplace to put the money that will do better if you believe the stock will gain value from here holding it may make more sense than taking your losses   specific example the mortgage crisis market crash of a few years ago people who sold because stock prices were dropping and they were scared or whose finances forced them to sell during the down period were hurt badly those of us who were invested for the long term and could afford to leave the money in the market or who were brave contrarian enough to see it as an opportunity to buy at a better price came out relatively unscathed all i have lost was two years of growth so you made your bet now you have to decide do you really want to buy high sell low and take the loss as a learning experience or do you want to wait and see whether you can sell not so low if you do n't know enough about the company to make a fairly rational decision on that front you probably should n't have bought its stock

i had a coworker whose stock picking skills were clearly in the 1 level i had a few hundred shares of bought at $ 10 when my coworker bought at $ 80 i quietly sold as it spiked to $ 100 it then crashed as did many high tech stocks and my friend sold his shares close to the $ 4 bottom advising that the company would go under so i backed up the truck at $ 5 which for me at the time meant 1000 shares this was one of nearly 50 trades i made over a good 10 year period he was loud enough to hear throughout the office and his trades whether buy or sell were 100 wrong   individual stocks are very tough as other posters have offered that combined with taking advice from those who probably had no business giving it   for the record i am semi retired not from stock picks but from budgeting 20 of income to savings and being indexed s&p with 90 of the funds   if there are options on your stock you might sell calls for a few years but that 's a long term prospect i 'd sell and take my losses lesson learned i hope

basically your question boils down to this where and how do i squeeze the stock market so that within time period x it will make me y dollars where i 'm emotionally attached to the y figure because i recently lost it and x is as soon as possible to make money on the stock market in a quasi guaranteed way you have to adjust x and y so that they are realistic for instance let x be twenty five years and y be 7 annual return small values of x are risky unless x is on the order of milliseconds and you have a computer program working for you to mitigate some of the risk of short term trading you have to treat trading seriously and study like mad study the stock market in general and not only that but carefully research the companies whose stocks you are buying work actively to discover stocks which are under valued relative to the performance of their corporation and which might correct upward relative to the performance of similar stocks always have an exit strategy for every position and stick to it use instruments like trailing stops automatic tracking which follows a price in one direction and then produces an order to close the position when the price reverses by a certain amount

i am very surprised no one mentioned the stock repair option strategy which has real benefits and is one of the mainstream option strategies quote who should consider using the stock repair strategy in a nutshell you are buying call options with current strike price at the money and sell call options with higher strike price out of the money all with the same expiry dates   the only reason to also sell call options here is to recover your premium paid for the other call options if you are comfortable paying that premium you just buy the call options without selling the others in case your stock will rise moderately to a price between the two strike prices your call option will rise together with your stock so you will be faster to recover your money this is the main reason it is called repair if you have sold any call options as the price rises you have to be careful when it reaches the strike price of the options sold as from there on you will begin incurring losses it is however exactly the lucky outcome you were hoping for your stock is higher and you can buy back those loss making options then or shortly before if you did n't sell any options and payed your premium you do n't need to worry at all at this stage warning it should be noted that the stock repair strategy offers no protection for your stock price further falling down in that case all those options will expire worthless or you can sell back the ones your bought but likely not for much in order to have the downside protection for your stock there are other strategies the simplest one being buying a put option at the money or slightly lower that will effectively cut your possible losses to the option premium which is the main use of that option   again if you hate to pay that premium you can offset it by selling other options that you either hope wo n't be exercised or take steps to protect you against those

you can do several things after the fact if you believe the stock will go up you can buy more stock now it 's what 's called averaging so you bought 100 at $ 10 now it 's at $ 7 to gain money from your original investment it needs to raise to over $ 10 but if you really think it 'll go up you can buy and average so you buy say 100 more stock at $ 7 now you have 200 shares at $ 8.50 average so you gain money on your investment when the stock goes over $ 8.50 instead of $ 10   of course you risk losing even more money if the stock keeps going down before the fact when you buy stock set triggers in most trading houses you can set automatic triggers to fire on conditions you set when you buy 100 shares at $ 10 you can set a trigger to automatically sell the 100 shares if it drops below $ 9 so you limit your losses to 10 for example

some financial planners would not advise one way or the other on a specific stock without knowing your investment strategy if you did n't have one their goal would be to help you develop one and introduce you to a portfolio management framework like asset allocation is a two of clubs a good card   well that all depends on what is in your hand diversification and what game you are strategy one possibility to reduce your basis over time if you would like to hold the stock is to sell calls against it known as a covered call   it can be an intermediate term 30 60 + months depending on option pricing trading strategy that may require you to upgrade your brokerage account to allow option trades   personally i like this strategy because it makes me feel proactive about my portfolio rather than sitting on the side lines and watching stocks move

the standard in such moving average crossover systems is the numbers are essentially arbitrary as long as the long term average is greater than the short term and there is some different between the averages in terms of the smoothing they provide i.e. comparing a 74 day ma to a 75 day ma is n't what the system is intended for there are plenty of software programs that will let you run through many possible values for the system over historical data i concur with the other answers in that this system indicator alone is n't very good however i disagree with their blanket off of technical analysis there are many successful traders out there the moving average cross over system is perhaps the second most primitive example of technical strategies categorized as trend following systems buying new recent highs and selling new recent lows being the most simple this particular system is n't very powerful because of its poor use of simple moving averages a simple moving average is intended to smooth out data but smoothing comes at the cost of lagging from the present a simple moving average essentially gives you an smoothing of price action for the day at that is one half of their period ago so your 200 day simple moving average shows you an smoothing of price action 100 days ago a lot can happen in 100 days and that is why this system is far from ideal

keep in mind that the exchanges do not hold buy or sell the stock people or funds do   all the exchange does is facilitate the sale of stock from one entity to another so the shares outstanding and market cap for a company are set regardless of how many exchanges the stock is listed on   the company typically indicates the number of shares outstanding in its financial statements   i do not know if the exchange itself keeps track of shares outstanding it may just report whatever the company publishes so theoretically if you wanted to buy all of the stock of a company you could do it all in one exchange provided that all the existing holders of the stock were willing to sell you their shares   there are many issues with that though which i do n't think are to your question

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

i do n't see how you could have this conversation without also including mention of the labor participation rate if the unemployment rate is low but there is still a huge pool of workers trying to get back into the workforce then you still have high competition for positions which would depress the wage rate this has been my experience looking for work in the last 12 months linkedin tracks applications and it is routine to see 100 300 applicants for entry level business analyst positions that are only a week or two old does that seem like low unemployment low competition for work hell no i bet most employers are still flooded with applications and can be as picky as they want and can lowball applicant wages

let 's divide all bank accounts into savings and checking the main difference is that checking is easy to get money from savings is hard to get money from because of this the federal reserve requires that banks keep more money on hand to cover transactions in checking accounts here is a related question from a banking customer regarding a recent notice on their bank statement deposit it seems that the bank was moving the customer 's money between hidden sub accounts to make it look like the checking account was really a savings account and thus reduce the amount of funds we are required to keep on deposit at the federal reserve bank if they did n't have to transfer the money many times the bank could keep less cash on hand but once they did 5 hidden transactions the rest of the money in the hidden savings account would be moved by the bank the 6 transaction limit is done to not allow you to treat savings like checking here is a relevant quote from the federal reserve savings deposits   savings deposits generally have no specified maturity    period they may be interest bearing with interest computed or paid    daily weekly quarterly or on any other basis the two most    significant features of savings deposits are the reservation of    right requirement and the restrictions on the number of    convenient transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month or    per statement cycle of at least four weeks from the account in order    to classify an account as a savings deposit the institution must    in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any    time to require seven advance written notice of an intended    withdrawal in practice this right is never exercised but the    institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account    agreement in addition for an account to be classified as a savings    deposit the depositor may make no more than six convenient    transfers or withdrawals per month from the account convenient    transfers and withdrawals for purposes of this limit include    automatic transfers including but not limited to    transfers from the savings deposit for overdraft protection or for    direct bill payments and transfers and withdrawals initiated by    telephone or computer and transfers made by check debit     card or other similar order made by the depositor and payable to    third parties other less convenient types of transfers such as    withdrawals or transfers made in person at the bank by mail or by    using an atm do not count toward the six per month limit and do not    affect the account ’s status as a savings account also a withdrawal    request initiated by telephone does not count toward the transfer    limit when the withdrawal is disbursed via check mailed to the    depositor   should be particularly wary of a bank ’s practices    for handling telephone transfers as noted an unlimited number of    telephone initiated withdrawals are allowed so long as a check for    the withdrawn funds is mailed to the depositor otherwise the limit    is six telephone transfers per month the limit applies to    transfers to move savings deposit funds to another type of deposit    account and to make payments to third parties

situation 1 i keep playing and eventually earn 1000 i withdraw    this will i get taxed if so by how much this is probably considered an award so whatever your country taxes for lottery gambling winnings would be applicable if there 's no specific taxation on this kinds of income then it is ordinary income situation 2 i deposit $ 5000 play the game lose some money and    withdraw equal to $ 4000 will i get taxed if so by how much since it is a game it is unlikely that deducting losses from your income would be allowed   however the $ 4000 would probably not be taxed as income since you are getting your own money back situation 3 i deposit $ 5000 and use this to buy in game items i    later sell these items for massive profits this can happen    over the course of 2 years for sure i withdraw $ 10000 will i get    taxed if so by how much either the same as 1 i.e. ordinary income or as capital gains although tax authority may argue that this was not a for profit investment and capital gains treatment should n't be applicable will i get taxed on withdrawals from real cash economy games and do    the taxes apply to the full withdrawal or only on the profits or    only on the profits above a certain amount generally income taxes only apply on income so if you paid $ 10000 and got back $ 12000 only the $ 2000 is considered income however some countries may tax full amounts under certain conditions such taxes are called franchise taxes for a proper tax advice consult with the locally licensed tax adviser

i would ask your hr or benefits department to be certain but here 's how i read that without any specific knowledge of the situation what is right to receive the rsu consideration company a was bought by company b.   you had unvested restricted stock units in a which is now gone   b is saying that you now have the right to receive consideration equivalent to the value of those rsus in a. since b is private there 's no publicly traded stock so it will likely be in cash but read the rest of the paperwork or talk to hr to be certain    for example if you had 100 rsus vesting next year and the price of stock in a was $ 50 when the company was bought those rsus would be worth $ 5,000   b is give you the right to consideration for those rsus hopefully for somewhere around $ 5,000   that consideration is unvested meaning you must stay employed until the vesting period in order to claim that right if you are fired without cause i.e. laid off you will receive those unvested claims as compensation    i assume the same will be applicable if employee leaves the company   probably not   in any situation if you voluntarily leave a company any unvested stock rsus options etc are forfeited

all right i will try to take this nice and slow this is going to be a little long try to bear with me suppose you contribute $ 100 to your newly opened 401(k you now have $ 100 in cash and $ 0 in mutual funds in your 401(k and $ 100 less than you used to somewhere else at some later date you use that money within the 401(k to buy a single share of the acme world all market index fund which happens to trade at exactly $ 100 per share on the day your purchase goes through as a result you have $ 0 in cash and exactly one share of that fund corresponding to $ 100 within your 401(k some time later the price of the fund is up 10 so your share is now worth $ 110 since you have n't contributed anything more to your 401(k for whatever reason your cash holding is still $ 0 because your holding is really denominated in shares of this mutual fund of which you still have exactly one the cash equivalent of your holding is now $ 110 now you can basically do one of two things by selling the share you protect against it falling in price thus in a sense locking in your gain but where do you put the money instead you obviously ca n't put the money in anything else that might fall in price doing so would mean that you could lose a portion of your gains the only way to truly lock in a gain is to remove the money from your investment portfolio altogether roughly speaking that means withdrawing the money and spending it and then you have to consider if the value of what you spent the money on can fluctuate and as a consequence fall what 's the value of that three weeks old of milk in the back of your refrigerator the beauty of compounding is that it does n't care when you bought an investment let 's say that you kept the original fund which was at $ 110 now since that day it is up another 5 since we are looking at the change of price of the fund over some period of time that 's 5 of $ 110 not 5 of the $ 100 you bought at which was an arbitrary point anyway 5 of $ 110 is $ 5.50 which means that the value of your holding is now at $ from a gain first of 10 followed by another 5 if at the same day when the original fund was at $ 110 you buy another $ 100 worth of it the additional 5 gain is realized on the sum of the two at the time of the purchase or $ 210 thus after the additional 5 gain you would have not $ 210 $ 100 + $ 100 + 5 nor $ $ 100 + 5 + $ 100 but $ $ 110 + $ 100 + 5 see how you do n't need to do anything in particular to realize the beauty of compounding growth there is one exception to the above some investments pay out dividends interest or equivalent in cash equivalents basically deposit money into an account of yours somewhere in the case of retirement plans usually within the same container where you are holding the investment these dividends are generally not counted against your contribution limits but check the relevant legal texts if you want to be absolutely certain this is somewhat uncommon in mutual funds but very common in other investments such as stocks or bonds that you purchase directly which you really should not do if you are just starting out and/or feel the need to ask this type of question in that case you need to place a purchase order yourself for whatever you want to invest the dividend in if you do n't then the extra money of the dividend will not be growing along with your original investment

fees liabilities yes the first problem is that liabilities are being improperly booked if the fee you charge is fixed upon deposit then the fee should credit revenue the fee charged to you should be booked by crediting cash and then debiting expenses and the remaining should be booked as a liability if the fee is fixed upon withdrawal then this will become more complex because of the fact that a change in the fee can occur before it can be applied   in this case the current fee should be credited as revenue and some allowance for fee increase should also be credited   the amount owed to the should be booked as a liability as before multiple currency bookings i will assume that this is for a cryptocurrency service of some sort considering the comments in your question and your presence on accounting can become very dangerous when mixing denominations   this is why all major accounting standards mandate books be maintained single currency in your case if the deposit is in usd for example and the liability is in btc then two books must be maintained one for each to account for your operation properly using single currency accounts the denominations must be exchanged internally and balanced across the two sets of books for a deposit of btc depository of usd the operation would be the same as described above but then the cash should be credited away and the liabilities debited away from the usd books with simultaneous cash debits and liability credits on the btc books considering the extreme volatility of cryptocurrency exchange rates accounts on the wrong set of books will quickly lead to insolvency or loss from improper accounting or both from revenue to income revenue can be construed as a liability since it could theoretically exist on the balance sheet i mention this because all books despite their name and quarter are really simply long t accounts like a blockchain   a blockchain could be into users individual income statements balance sheets as the reverse of this concept revenues are credited expenses are debited   the difference net income is debited away with a credit to owners equity

a while back i sold cars for a living   over the course of 4 years i worked for 3 different dealerships   i sold new cars at 2 and used at the last one when selling new cars i found that the majority of people buying the higher end cars honestly should n't have been 80%+   they almost always came in owing more on their trades then they were worth put down very little cash and were close to being financially strapped    from a financial perspective these deals were hard to close not because the buyer was picky but rather because their finances were a mess   fully half and probably more we had to switch from the car they initially wanted down to a much cheaper version or try to convert to a lease because it was the only way the bank would loan the money   we called them $ 30,000 millionaires because they did n't make a whole lot but tried to look like they did   as a salesman you knew you were in serious trouble when they did n't even try to negotiate around 2 of the deals i did were actual cash deals meaning honest cash not those who came in with a pre approved loan from a bank   these were invariably for used cars about 3 to 4 years old and they never had a trade in   the people doing this always looked comfortable but never dressed up you would n't even look at them twice   the negotiations were hard because they knew exactly how much that car should go for and would n't even pay that    it was obvious they knew the value of money that said i 've been in the top 3 of wage earners for about 20 years and at no point have i considered myself in a position to afford a new luxury car   imho there are far more important things you can do with that kind of money

they are right to ask for the money back because you were not entitled to that money however you may have a defense called basically you can try to show that because of the government 's unreasonable delay in asking for the money back in the meantime you relied on the assumption that it was your money in good faith and spent it and now to have to come up with the money that you assumed you would n't need would cause great harm to you

having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole built a budget to get a better view of what spending is i can say what the greatest gift it brings is it 's a decision tool when you are spending out of only one account you often make decisions based on the total money in the account should we go out for dinner can i make this impulse purchase this is terrible because many if not all of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries bills etc you ca n't see how many of those dollars are discretionary a budget is like having many accounts instead of looking at your real account(s to make spending decisions you look at your budget lines you to want impulse buy a gadget do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line if yes the decision is yours if no the budget is telling you that you do n't have dollars for that similarly for more purchases you want to splurge on some non staple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe and the budget line for groceries will tell you if you can do that instead of looking at e.g. $ 6000 in a chequing account you 're looking at $ 600 assigned $ spend = $ available in a monthly groceries budget line just like you can now see where your money has been going by maintaining and using your budget lines and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned total spent and total remaining you can continue to see where your money is going in near real time you 're no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out what 's going on and plan you 're looking at money flows and future intentions as you should be this approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances so that 's what a budget is for real time spending decision making control over your money which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart and guilt free spending in more categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend a budget line with insufficient funds does n't actually take the decision entirely away from you though if a budget line does n't have funds to spare for a given purchase you can still make the purchase but now you 're also making the decision to go and revise your budget taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line you 've overspent to keep the budget accurate

the hsa tax deduction comes when you contribute money to the hsa not when you take money out so you can contribute up to the max and take your maximum deduction each year regardless of what medical expenses you have   if you have medical expenses but no money left in your hsa you will just have to pay for them out of pocket however in the future when your hsa has money in it again you can reimburse yourself for medical expenses you have now as long as you have an hsa in place even if there is no money in it currently there is no time limit to reimburse yourself for those medical expenses   reimburse yourself for what you can and keep track of whatever expenses you are unable to reimburse at this time hopefully in a future year your health will improve or your medical coverage will improve and you can catch up reimbursing yourself for these old expenses   regarding your question about tax benefit the hsa acts similar to a traditional ira when invested growing tax deferred so if you contribute and choose not to withdraw but instead invest there are tax advantages similar to an ira however if you are already investing a sufficient amount in retirement accounts there is nothing wrong with reimbursing yourself now for the expenses if you need the money you get the primary tax deduction either way

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

you did n't specify where in the world you account is scotiabank operates in many countries however for large amounts where there is a currency conversion involved you are almost guaranteed to be better off going to a specialist currency broker or payments firm rather than using a direct method with your bank such as a wire transfer based on my assumption that your account is in canada one provider who i have personally used with success in transferwise but the best place to compare where is the best venue for you is in the off chance that this is an account with scotiabank in the united states any domestic payment method such as a domestic wire transfer should do the job perfectly well the fees do n't matter for larger amounts as they are a single fee versus a percentage fee like you see with currency conversions

firstly and this part is rather opinion based i would absolutely not think of making more pension contributions when you are currently totaling 6 of salary as over contributing there are some who argue that you should be putting a minimum of 20 away for retirement throughout your working life you do n't say how old you are how close to retirement you are but a common rule of thumb is to halve your age and put away that of your salary into your pension so i would certainly start with upping those contributions   i actually do n't think it makes much difference whether you go for just your workplace pension versus a separate private one in general you end up paying management fees that are a of the value so whether it is in one place or split does n't cost any less the all eggs in one basket syndrome is a possible argument but equally if you change jobs a few times and end up with half a dozen pension pots it can be very hard to stay on top of them all if you end up with everything in one pot and then transfer it when you change jobs it 's easier to manage other options    isa as you mentioned on the plus side these are tax free on the minus side you can either go for a cash isa which at the moment has very low rates of return and/or a stocks and shares isa which exposes you to risks in the stock market    if you have debt consider paying it off early overpaying student loans may or may not be the exception to this depending on your personal situation certainly if you have a mortgage you can save a vast amount by overpaying early    other investments stocks and shares btl housing fine wines bitcoin there are almost limitless possibilities but it makes sense to max out the tax efficient options before you look into these

if a person is not a u.s. citizen and they live and work outside the u.s. then any income they make from a u.s. company or person for services provided does not qualify as u.s. source income according to the irs   therefore you would n't need to worry about withholding or providing tax forms for them for u.s. taxes   see the irs publication 519 u.s. tax guide for aliens

yes there are some real dangers in having your money locked into an investment those dangers are well worth thinking about and planning for where you are going off the rails is acting like those are the only dangers to your money and perhaps having an exaggerated idea of the size of the dangers it is an excellent idea to keep an emergency fund with a few months living expenses in a readily accessible savings or checking account however a standard retail savings account is always going to pay less in interest then you are loosing through inflation we 're living in a low inflation period but it 's still continuously eating away at the value of your savings it makes sense to accept the danger of inflation for your emergency fund but probably not for your retirement savings to reduce the hazards of inflation you need to find an investment that has some chance of paying more than the inflation rate this is inevitably going to mean locking up your money for some period of time or accepting some other type of risk there is no guaranteed safe path in the world you can only do your best to understand the risks you are running as an example you could put your savings in a cd rather than a vanilla savings account a cd these days wo n't pay much in interest but it will be more than a savings account however you have to commit to a term for the cd if you take your money out early you will have to pay a penalty how much of a penalty in the worse case it could be in the neighborhood of 4 of the amount you withdraw so yeah if you deposit $ 10,000 in a 5-year cd and end up needing it all back the very next day you could end up paying the bank $ 400   if you withdraw money from a 401k before you are 59 1/2 you will pay a 10 penalty and you will have to have income tax withheld on the amount you withdraw on the other hand if your employer matches 100 of your 401k contributions you could be throwing away 50 of your possible retirement savings because of your fear of the possibility of a 10 loss in addition 401k plans do have some exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty there are provisions for medical emergencies and home purchases for example however the qualifications are not entirely straight forward and you should read up on them before enrolling the real answer to your fears is planning figure out your living expenses figure out how much you want in an emergency fund figure out when you will be wanting to buy a house have a child or go back to school set aside the savings you 'll need for all those and then for the remainder of your money you can consider long term investments with some confidence that you probably wo n't need to face the early withdrawal penalties

yes though i 'd likely put a caveat on that if you take short term investments and extrapolate the results to get an annual result this can be misleading for example if a stock goes up 10 in a month assuming this will continue for the next 11 months may not be a great idea thus beware of how much data do you have in making these calculations when looking at long term investments the compound annual growth rate can be quite useful for comparison

i 've been told by staff in my local car hire agency that they get such big discounts that they actually make money selling the cars so they replace all their cars every six months in the uk the number plate indicates when the car was registered in six month periods this suits the manufacturers because it means they can offer a lower cost product to price sensitive customers while charging more to people who want something brand new for example you could buy a brand new fiesta for £ 14,000 or a 6 month old version of the same car with a few thousand miles on the clock for £ 12,000 this means if you only have £ 12,000 then you can afford to buy a nearly new fiesta but if you can afford a bit more then ford will happily take that off you for a brand new fiesta ford sell an extra car and if the car hire company only paid £ 11,000 then they make some profit too

you understood it pretty right every fiscal year which runs from april 6 year y to april 5 year you can deposit a total this number is subject to an annual increase by hmrc into your isas you can open 2 new isa every year but the amount deposited to those isas shall not excess in total from the tax year some isas now permit you to replace any funds you have withdrawn without using up your allowance it used to be that if you deposited k and then withdrew k you could not pay in to that isa again within that tax year as you had already used your full allowance under new flexible isa rules this would be allowed providing you replace the funds in the same isa account and within the same tax year strongly recommend that you check the small prints related to your account to make sure this is he case any gains and losses on the investments held in the isa accounts are for you to take i.e. if you make investment gains of k this does not reduces your allowance you will still be able to deposit or whatever hmrc increases that number to in the following year you are also allowed to consolidate your isas you can ask bank a to transfer the amount held into an isa with bank held with bank b. this is usually done by filling a special form with the bank that will held the money post transactions again here be very careful do not withdraw the money to transfer it yourself as this would count against the k limit instead follow the procedures from the bank finally if you do n't use your allowance for a given year you can not use it during the following year i.e. if you do n't deposit the k this year then you can not deposit k next year nb i used the word deposit it does not matter to hmrc if the money get invested or not if you are in a rush on april 4th just make sure the money is wired into the isa account by the 5th no need to rush and make bad investment decision you can invest it later   hope it helps

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

leverage amplifies gains and losses when returns are positive leverage makes them more positive but when returns are negative leverage makes them more negative since most investments have a positive return in the long run leverage is generally considered a good idea for long term illiquid investments like real estate   that said to quote keynes in the long run we are all dead in the case of real estate specifically negative returns generally happen when house prices drop assuming you have no intention of ever selling the properties you can still end up with negative returns if rents fall mortgage rates increase or tax rates rise all of which tend to correlate with falling property values also if cash flow becomes negative you may be forced to sell during a down market thereby the loss   besides loss scenarios leverage can turn a small gain into a loss because leverage has a price interest that is subtracted from any amplified gains and added to any amplified losses to give a specific example if you realize a 0.1 gain on x$ when unleveraged you could end up with a 17 loss if leveraged 90 at 2 interest gains loss one reason leveraged investments are popular particularly with real estate is that the investor can file bankruptcy to erase a large negative net worth   this means the down side of a leveraged investment is limited for the highly leveraged investor this leads to a get rich or start over mentality common among the self made millionaire and failed entrepreneurs   unfortunately this dynamic also leads to serious problems for the banking sector in the event of a large nation wide devaluation of real estate prices

yes they are and you 've experienced why generally speaking stocks that pay dividends will be better investments than stocks that do n't   here 's why 1 they 're actually making money they can balance sheets and news releases but cash is cash it tells no lies they ca n't fake it    2 there 's less good they can do with that money than they say when a business you own is making money they can do two things with it reinvest it into the company or hand it over to you all companies must reinvest to some degree but only a few companies worth owning can find profitable ways of reinvesting all of it having to hand you the owner some of the earnings helps keep that money from leaking away on such necessities like corporate jets expensive printer paper or ill conceived corporate buyouts       3 it helps you not freak out markets go up and markets go down if you own a good company that 's giving you a nice check every three months it 's a lot easier to not panic sell in a downturn after all they 're handing you a nice check every three months and checks are cash and cash tells no lies you know they 're still a good company and you can ride it out     4 it helps others not freak out see 3 that applies to everyone that in turn means market downturns weigh less heavily on companies paying solid dividends than on those that do not   5 it gives you some of the reward of investing in good companies without having to sell those companies if you 've got a piece of a good solid profitable growing company why on earth would you want to sell it   but you 'd like to see some rewards from making that wise investment would n't you      6 dividends can grow solid growing companies produce more and more earnings which means they can hand you more and more cash via the dividend which means that if say they reliably raise dividends that measly 3 dividend turns into a 6 dividend seven years later on your initial investment at year 14 it 's 12 year 21 24 see where this is going companies like that do exist google dividend   7 dividends make growth less important if you owned a company that paid you a 10 dividend every year but never grew an inch would you care how about 5 and it grows only slowly   you invest in companies not dividends you invest in companies to make money dividends are a useful tool when you invest to gauge company value to smooth your ride and to give you some of the profit of the business you own they are however only part of the total return from investing as you found out

if the person has prepared put your affairs in order then they will have a will and an executor and this executor will have a list of the life insurance policies and will contact the companies to arrange payouts to the beneficiaries it 's not really the beneficiary 's job to do that if the person has n't made a list of their policies but has a will and an executor then the executor can try things like looking at recently paid bills you 're sending $ 100 a month to friendly life insurance company bet it 's a life insurance policy or paperwork that is in the person 's home or their safety deposit boxes even if you do n't have the key to those boxes a copy of the will and the death certificate will get the box drilled out for you if you do n't know what bank they might have sd boxes at again your paperwork will get the manager to find out for you if there is a box at that particular branch so a day spent visiting branches can be fruitful something i know from personal experience with someone whose affairs were nowhere near in order generally you find out you 're a beneficiary of a will because the executor tells you i suppose it 's possible that a person might name you beneficiary of their life insurance without telling you or anyone else and without writing a will but it 's pretty unlikely if you 're worried i suggest you encourage your parents grandparents and other likely of you to write up some paperwork and keep it somewhere family is likely to find it not hidden inside a book on a or in the back of the wool

it depends on the area you want to focus in   to be sure i will say that pretty much all certificates in finance can be achieved online now   cfp is a pretty ok one i have it myself there is quite a bit of material but is n't too challenging it focuses on financial planning personal finance certainly aids your technical knowledge but is kind of an analog to help boost your sales most pure planners i know have this but moreover a series of more technical designations you must have a bachelors to be given the right to use the cfp   cfa is a great one for your resume and knowledge but makes the cfp look like a summer vacation it is for analysis but has a broad range of potential uses i know brokers advisors planners and people leaders with these marks if you are very smart it will take you a minimum of 2.5 years really to complete due to their testing schedule they also grade on a very steep curve from what i understand the amount of information and level of command you must demonstrate also necessitate this lengthy schedule   beyond that you can look at getting finra licensed in a desired area e.g. series to be a broker i would caution against this unless you are very sure of where you want to go or need to meet the requirement for a job typically jobs with license requirements will permit you 3 6 months to obtain them on company money you risk spending a good bit of money that wo n't be reimbursed by getting licensed independently keep in mind that you can not actually use your licenses without a firm sponsor   finally there are a variety of specialized designations like and that i would also caution against unless sure of desired position or meeting job requirements it is better in my opinion to find yourself in a place where getting these will better position you for your current job rather than wasting time on them and finding yourself in a place where they hold no water

because this is money se and you 're connecting it to offspring i 'd think about a discussion with them to get their agreements from my perspective anything my wife and i have will go to offspring in the end as such everything borrowed and not repaid simply reduces the estate by that much among multiple offspring such reductions should be against the borrower rather than spreading it out that should be accounted for in whatever will is created this would be the discussion point it might also be discussed how or even if any interest should accrue for unpaid amounts if for example a 1 apr is agreed upon for unpaid loans then the final amount is taken off of the borrower 's inheritance existing outstanding loans might or might not be useful examples for sample calculations if desired or needed if nothing else they might serve as reminders that loans were not forgotten by having such a discussion you can show that you are trying to plan for a fair distribution of your estate perhaps thereby any concern about charging interest to offspring for repaid loans at the same time you 're handing over some financial responsibility giving them a power of personal choice which seems to be a part of what you 're concerned about once such a discussion is started it 's possible that any question of interest will resolve itself naturally the discussion almost necessarily must include all offspring at once one will find it harder to negotiate from a standpoint of pure self interest without objection from another think beforehand about what will be said and about what responses might come think things through as much as you can

you have a loan you can probably assume you 're going to have to repay that loan every dollar and every dollar that 's outstanding on that loan costs you interest so assuming you 're not hit by any pre payment penalty any dollar that you pay down on your house right now saves you a compounded a year where r is your mortgage rate it does n't really matter whether you 're planning to sell it in a few years or not if you pay $ n you 'll save the interest + $ n taken from the sale price and sent to the bank when you sell the house and move though you might get a tax deduction on the interest if you have a better place to park your money and earn a decent rate of return it would be worth it to do that instead of paying down the mortgage if you had another loan with higher interest rates that 's probably a better loan to pay off if you can spend some of all of it on something that 's actually genuinely worth of its purchase price a year plus whatever the wear and tear takes away from its value if anything then spend it on that instead that 'd be a better investment for instance investments in the stock market may offer better returns however that 's risky observe that you ca n't lose money paying down your mortgage and that safety is usually relatively expensive these days so it 's not a bad deal but if you 're talking about using it for long term retirement savings that are tax advantaged to boot that 's another matter if you already have ample emergency funds and were just planning on putting the money into a savings account to rot at taxable interest it 's definitely worth it to pay down your balance now unless you 're about to sell so the savings are slight and it 's a real inconvenience

it is also possible that the settlement company did n't tell the local government where to send the new tax bill this would worry me because what else was missed regarding filing the proper documents with the lenders and the local government it could also be a problem with the local government contact the settlement company or your attorney to get the issue resolved if you owe the money you want to know if the new owner owes the money they do n't want to face a tax lien because the settlement company made a mistake generally this is split between the parties based on the number of days each will own the home at settlement the money should move from one party to the other based on what has been deposited into escrow and when the actual bills are due for example the payment for the first half of the year due july 1st may be sent in june if the settlement was in june the new owner would give money to the old owner but if settlement was in early july money would move the other way

i have some numbers to share that may help   i 've been tracking my home 's natural gas consumption in a spreadsheet for years   much of that time i 'd only been interested in the quantity used to measure my home 's efficiency after certain upgrades but in 2006 i also started tracking the gas supply charge costs from my local utility in ontario canada   my numbers are for the gas commodity only i.e. excluding delivery and customer charges i 've never been on a fixed price contract so the numbers are supposed to be reflective of market rates   however the numbers do differ from real spot prices because estimates gas costs up front and then applies a gas cost adjustment at later dates if their estimate was wrong natural gas cost per cubic meter for chris 's home since 2006 natural gas prices have been generally falling   the last cost i have on file from my november 2009 bill is cents per cubic meter being ~20 cents gas supply rate less gas cost adjustment of cents   my average cost over that nearly 4 year period january 2006 through november 2009 was cents per cubic meter considering the current 5-year fixed rate i found is about 29 cents per cubic meter there is a substantial premium to locking in when compared to current market rates   however one can see that during the last 4 years market prices did substantially exceed that rate for quite some time   furthermore when i last looked at those 5-year fixed rates perhaps a year or more ago i could n't find a company charging less than 39 cents per cubic meter   so contract rates have fallen as well consequently if we are at a natural gas price low and the economy is to recover i tend to agree with cart 's answer and suggest it could be a good time to consider a fixed rate contract but do your own due diligence and read the fine print if you go for it update in the interest of full disclosure shortly after i did my own research above i signed up for my first ever fixed rate natural gas contract

a company typically goes public in order to bring in additional capital in an ipo the company through its officials will typically do so by issuing additional shares and offering to sell those to investors if they did not do that then there would be no net capital gain for the company if person a sells share in company c to person b then company c does not benefit directly from the exchange by issuing and selling additional shares the total value of all stock in the company can increase being publicly traded also greatly increases the confidence in the valuation of the company as a consequence of the perfect market theory there is nothing in this that says that initial investors cofounders employees etc need to sell their shares in the process they might choose to do so or they might not or they might be prevented from doing so by terms of any agreements that they have signed or by insider trading laws compare what happens to internal stock when a company goes public depending on specifics it might be reasonable for the company to perform a share split prior to the initial public offering that however does n't affect the total value of the shares only the price per share

you are looking to be made whole so the requests need to be reasonable   you need to be clear that you want you are n't going to punish the dry cleaner or anything else   you do n't want coupons or free service for future work you want your pants or cash if you send a letter send it certified with a return receipt   you want to be able to show a judge you made efforts outside of the court that you attempted to reconcile the issue   sending it certified is also a good way to indicate to the dry cleaner that you are n't going to just go away   be clear firm and very polite   you can not blame or criticize the cleaner simply state on date i did n't get my pants back i want my pants or i want money by xx xx xxxx date if you want to picket contact local law enforcement and find out the rules before   you can probably picket from a sidewalk but that does n't mean the dry cleaner wo n't approach you and get in your personal space    if you hand out flyers stick strictly to provable facts lest you be sued for defamation   it is smarter to hand out a fact sheet or speak from a script so that you do n't say something that would be actionable   make sure you pick the day of the week for a dry cleaner weekends i do n't think this is criminal but you can sue   like others said if you have the cleaning ticket and the ticket does n't absolve the dry cleaner of responsibility you will probably get a judgement   be careful what you ask for make sure you cover all of your costs the pants filing fees time off of work and collection efforts   itemize all your requested costs and make sure they are reasonable   you only want to be made whole and that only means $ 160 or pants plus fees just because you won in small claims does n't mean you can collect easily   figure in your cost for collecting when you sue   you might have to hire somebody to collect on your judgement   if you hire somebody they will want a cut so you might want to figure that out for your small claims   i am guessing this is a local business so it should be pretty easy to collect   unless they go out of business in which case you will get nothing

paraphrased from economics of money banking and financial markets money is 1 a medium of exchange 2 a unit of account 3 a store of value   to the first point as simpson 's brain explained to him money can be exchanged for goods and services   the second money acts as a measure to keep track of the relative worth of an enormous amount of items this makes it much simpler than tracking how many apples are worth how many and so on and so forth as occurs in barter economies   the last point money is a terrible store of value your money tends to inflate meaning that its worth decreases over time   i think your explanation went into territory that it did n't need to your explanation of the creation of money for example seems to imply that the banking system is not involved in the process of money creation when actually the opposite is true

i heard today while listening to an accounting podcast that a balance sheet can be used to determine if a company has enough money to pay its employees   the money that you 're looking at is specifically cash on the balance sheet the cash flows document mentioned is just a more finance related document that explains how we ended at cash on the balance sheet    even looking for a job this is critical that i do n't believe many people look at when searching for a job using the ratios listed below can and many others one can determine if the business they are applying for will be around in the next five years    can someone provide me a pair of examples one good my favorite example of a high cash company is nintendo rolling at 570 billion usd in cash alone is astonishing using the ratios we can see how well they are doing   can someone provide me a pair of examples one bad tesla is a good example of the later on being cash poor    walk me though how to understand such a document note this question is highly complex and will take months of reading to fully comprehend the components that make up the financial statements i would recommend that this question be posted completely separate

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

there are two sources for shares that employees buy through a company can simply buy the shares on the open market the company must pay for the stock but the employee then pays the company for the shares if employees get a discount on the esop shares the company would pay for that percentage directly the company can choose to issue new shares these new shares dilute the ownership of all the other current stockholders while 2 is common when companies issue stock options i 'd be surprised to see it with an esop in most cases employees are limited in the amount of their salary they can devote towards the esop if that limit is 10 and the discount that the employees get is 10 the cost on a per employee basis would only be 1 of that employees salary which is a small expense

and who said high finance is n't criminal half the time did any one important go to jail for inflating the housing market and defrauding people in 2008 of course not   but back to your point about paying people a lot of money to save lives which is repeated ad it is n't relevant because it assumes smart people only discover things to make a lot of money ya go tell that to academics who spend their lives in labs etc discovering things and building science from the ground up i wonder how much they get paid vs. pharma execs    and even if it proves true to some people i think most would agree that say doctors and drug inventors who actually save lives should be paid well but that 's not the people we are dealing with here we are dealing with financial who just make money off of this because they can and nobody is there to regulate them

in general to someone in a similar circumstance i might suggest that the lowest risk option is to immediately convert your excess currency into the currency you will be spending note that risk here refers only to the variance in possible outcomes by converting to eur now assuming you are moving to an eu country using the eur you eliminate the chance that the gbp will weaken but you also eliminate the chance that the gbp will strengthen thus you have reduced the variance in possible outcomes so that you have a known amount of eur to put money in a different currency than what you will be using is a form of investing and it is one that can be considered high risk invest in a uk company while you plan on staying in the uk and you take on the risk of stock ownership only but invest in a german company while you plan on staying in the uk you take on the risk of stock ownership + the risk of currency volatility if you are prepared for this type of risk and understand it you may want to take on this type of risk but you really must understand what you 're getting into before you do this for most people i think it 's fair to say that fx investing is more accurately called gambling see more comments on the risk of fx trading here however this risk reduction only truly applies if you are certain that you will be moving to an eur country if you invest in eur but then move to the us you have not solved your currency volatility problem you have simply replaced your gbp risk with eur risk if you had your plane ticket in hand and nothing could stop you then you know what your currency needs will be in 2 years but if you have any doubt then exchanging currency now may not be reducing your risk at all what if you exchange for eur today and in a year you decide for all the various reasons that circumstances in life may change that you will stay in the uk after all and during that time what if the gbp strengthened again you will have taken on risk unnecessarily   so if you lack full confidence in your move you may want to avoid fully trading your gbp today perhaps you could put away some amount every month into eur if you plan on moving to an eur country and leave some most in gbp this would not fully eliminate your currency risk if you move but it would also not fully expose yourself to risk if you end up not moving just remember that doing this is not a guarantee that the eur will strengthen and the gbp will weaken

think about the implications if the world worked as your question implies that it should   a $ 15 share of stock would return you at least $ 15 after 3 months plus another $ 15 after 6 months plus another after 9 and 12 months   this would have returned to you $ 60 over the year that you owned it plus you still own the share   only then would the stock be worth buying   anything less than $ 60 would be too little to be worth bothering about for $ 15 such a thing would indeed be worth buying but you wo n't find golden egg laying stocks like that on the stock market   why   because other people would outbid your measly $ 15 in order to get this $ year producing stock in fact they would bid many hundreds of dollars   since other people bid more you ca n't find such a deal available of course there are the points others have brought up the earnings per share are yearly not quarterly unless otherwise noted   the earnings may not be sent to you at all or only a small part but you would gain much of their value because the company should be worth about that much more by keeping the earnings

if i donate $ 10,000 to charity then i can deduct that $ 10,000 from my income and not pay income taxes on it   so if i make $ 50,000 a year then i will only pay income taxes on $ 40,000 instead of $ 50,000 since i donated $ 10,000 to charity   this is what is meant when charity contributions are said to be tax deductible do n't feel like you have to donate to charity   you owe no one anything   you do more for others by working assuming you work in the private sector if you know of someone personally that is in need of aid then you could give them some help directly   i find this more effective then blindly dumping money in a bureaucratic inefficient charity   i also find there are very few people in need of charity personally i think charity donations are a way for people to feel good about themselves   they rarely care if their donations are effective

fundamentals   then remember that you want to put 20 or more down in cash to avoid pmi and recalculate with chunk taken out of your savings   many banks offer calculators on their websites that can help you run these numbers and figure out how much house a given mortgage can pay for remember that the old advice that you should buy the largest house you can afford or the newer advice about starter homes are both questionable in the current market = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = added   if you 're willing to settle for a rule of thumb first approximation ballpark estimate maximum mortgage payment rule of 28 your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income your income before taxes are taken out   maximum housing cost rule of 32 your total housing payments including the mortgage homeowner ’s insurance and private mortgage insurance pmi association fees and property taxes should not exceed 32 percent of your gross monthly income maximum total debt service rule of 40 your total debt payments including your housing payment your auto loan or student loan payments and minimum credit card payments should not exceed 40 percent of your gross monthly income as i said many banks offer web based tools that will run these numbers for you these are rules that the lending uses for a quick initial screen of an application they do not guarantee that you in particular can afford that large a loan just that it is n't so bad that they wo n't even look at it note that this is all in terms of mortgage which means it 's also affected by what interest rate you can get how long a mortgage you 're willing to take and how much you can afford to pull out of your savings also as noted if you ca n't put 20 down from savings the bank will hit you for pmi standard reminder unless you to live in the same place for five years or more buying a house is questionable financially there is nothing wrong with renting depending on local housing stock it may be cheaper houses come with costs and hassles rental even renting a house does n't buy a house only when it makes sense both financially and in terms of what you actually need to make your life pleasant do not buy a house only because you think it 's an investment real estate can be a profitable business but thinking of a house as simultaneously both your home and an investment is a good way to get yourself into trouble

at the current rates stated in the question i would push additional funds towards your stafford loans as their higher interest rates will incur interest charges almost 3 times faster than your private loans with my loans i have not seen much information regarding private loans jumping the interest rate close to the 6.8 any time in the coming years if others have insight to this i look forward to the comments   due to the private loans being variable there is an element of risk to their rates increasing another way to look at it may be to prorate your amount of extra payments according to their interest rate   $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your stafford loans $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your private loans

a closed end fund is a collective investment scheme that is closed to new investment once the fund starts operating   a typical open ended fund will allow you to buy more shares of the fund anytime you want and the fund will create those new shares for you and invest your new money to continue growing assets under management   a closed end fund only using the initial capital invested when the fund started operating and no new shares are typically created always exception in the financial community   normally you buy and sell an open end fund from the fund company directly   a closed end fund will usually be bought and sold on the secondary market here is some more information from wikipedia some characteristics that distinguish a closed end fund from an ordinary open end mutual fund are that another distinguishing feature of a closed end fund is the common use of leverage or gearing to enhance returns cefs can raise additional investment capital by issuing auction rate securities preferred shares long term debt and/or reverse repurchase agreements in doing so the fund hopes to earn a higher return with this excess invested capital

someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why a la carte would n't work or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it    iirc the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $ 100/mo package helped subsidize the rest of the less popular channels       most of the niche channels probably could n't exist in an a la carte environment unless they were ridiculously cheap and if they were ridiculously cheap they would n't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat    also how would the pricing work   could i subscribe to amc for 1 hour a week to watch mad men   or would i be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day week month       imho what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like rss feeds

others have pointed out that many benefits offered by employers for free are actually taxed the employee must pay taxes on the value of what they 're receiving usually services of some kind this is called imputed income also pointed out was that healthcare is an exception a specifically protected class of benefits that are n't taxed but sometimes they are many companies now offer domestic partner health coverage as well regardless of whether the couple is in any kind of civil union or other arrangement the costs to the employee vary but it 's often that they simply pay double of what their individual coverage contribution would be independent of the employee 's direct contribution for their domestic partner they must also pay taxes on the value of the employer 's cost of the coverage this can be significant as typically the employer is paying the lion 's share of the healthcare cost

first of all you 'll need a securities account nowadays most large banks offer this as a standard product for all their customers though it may require some extra paperwork then you need to buy shares in the etf this is indeed typically done through the stock market but there are alternatives some banks will sell securities to you directly but usually only those they create themselves options and such some also offer etf investment plans that allow you to buy shares for a fixed amount each month through the bank in any case the bank 's online banking interface should support all these options however fees are an important consideration with some banks the securities account is free others charge an annual fee and the fees on stock market transactions and investment plans also vary considerably so it could be worth it to consider some alternatives

the government thought of that a long time ago and has any loophole there plugged like if you set up a company to buy a car and then allow you to use it you can use the car for company business like driving to a customer 's office to make a sales call or delivery and the cost of the car is then tax deductible but the company must either prohibit personal use of the car or keep a log of personal versus business use and the personal use becomes taxable income to you so at best you 'd get to deduct an expense here and then you 'd have to add it back there for a net change in taxable income of zero in general the irs is very careful about personal use of business property and makes it tough to get away with a free ride i 'm sure there are people who lie about it and get away with it because they 're never audited but even if that causes you no ethical qualms it 's very risky i do n't doubt that there are people with very smart lawyers who have found loopholes in the rules but it 's not as simple as i call myself a business and now all my personal expenses become tax deductible business expenses if you could do that everybody would do it and no one would pay taxes which might be a good thing but the irs does n't see it that way

the crucial question not addressed by other answers is your ability to repay the debt    borrowing is always about leverage and leverage is always about risk   in the home improvement loan case default comes with dire to extinguish the debt you might have to sell your home with a stable job reliable income and sufficient cash flow and of course comfort that the project will yield benefits you 're happy to pay for then the clear answer is go ahead and borrow but if you work in a highly cyclical industry have very little cash saved or for whatever other reason are uncertain about your future ability to pay then do n't borrow   save until you are more comfortable you can handle the loan   that does n't necessarily mean save all the money just save enough that you are highly confident in your ability to pay whatever you borrow

congrats make sure you nail down now what happens to the house should you eventually separate i know lots of unmarried couples who have stayed together for decades and look likely to do so for life i 've also seen some marriages break up that i would n't have expected to better to have this discussion now   beyond that main immediate implications are that you have new costs taxes utilities maintenance and new tax issues mortgage interest and property tax deductability and you 're going to have to figure out how to allocate those between you if there is a between not sure whether unmarried couples can file jointly these days

ummm yeah if you 'd like to explain to me how google is performing poorly that 'd be great i 'd like to have that in a post by tomorrow    total revenue has jumped 51 from last year just taking a quick look at their financial statements their revenue has increased 1.9 billion from quarter before to billion their cash and cash converts are up about 2.5 billion from the quarter before finally their total equity for the company is up about 3.5 billion from the quarter before   not bad if you think this is a bad quarter i 'd love to see what their good quarters are   what 's weighing them down is the buying of motorola for 13.5 billion but think about it they have revenues of that in just one quarter and even more have enough cash to buy motorola in cash 3 times over and still have some left over

to answer your question in its entirety there 's more information we need exchange session traded security order type etc most exchanges support partial fills that is your order will be partially executed and modified   in your example you 'd get an execution of 10 shares at $ 100 and your order ticket will be modified to $ 100 for 990 shares like john bensin explained there are ways to prevent partial filling through order e.g. fill or kill my addition here is there are also ways to prevent the other bit i.e. do the partial fill but do n't keep a modified order in the system   you 'd have to mark the order immediate or cancel   in your case you 'd be partially filled 10 and that 's it   for the remaining 990 shares you 'd have to enter a new order

i agree it 's crony capitalism i think people should make that clear instead of just saying capitalism all those things you mentioned are from the government corporations will try to make profit that 's what they 're suppose to do i mean nobody blames apple for making shit tons of money    the politicians are the ones that need to stop selling out america for their own benefits they 're   the ones that does n't allow buying health insurance across state lines they 're   the ones that wo n't let car manufacture sell directly to consumers they 're the reason i can only get comcast you think i love comcast    ca n't blame capitalism for shitty politicians   love the debate though

that 's great that you have saved up money you are ahead of your peers i would advise against investing in an index fund the attraction of the idea is that you will get the same return as the base item for example an index fund of gold would supposedly give you the same return as if you bought gold in reality this is not true the return of an index fund is always significantly below the return of the underlying commodity your best strategy is to invest in something you know and understand there are two books that can help you learn how to do this one up on wall street by peter lynch and the intelligent investor by benjamin graham buying reading and following the guidance in these two books is your best investment of time and money

first congratulations on the paycheck   on the holds is it possible that by allowing your account balance to go negative into overdraft that you triggered such treatment of your account   perhaps the bank is being more cautious with your account since that happened   just how long did you have their $ 150 on hold   or perhaps it 's not you specifically but the bank is being more cautious due to credit conditions that have been prevalent these last years   consider allowing you to cash a check immediately when it technically has n't cleared yet is a form of credit   maybe it is n't you they do n't trust well enough yet but the company that issued the check   checks bounce and not by fault of the depositor i once had a new account years ago and discovered a 5 day hold on deposits   the irony was it was a check drawn on the same bank   i called my banker and asked about it and suggested i 'd take my business back to my old bank   i was in the process of applying for a mortgage with the new bank   holds were removed but you may have some trouble with the i 'll walk technique given the climate and your recent overdraft situation and no leverage or if you do have some leverage consider using it but before you assume anything i would as johnfx suggested ask your bank about it   pay your branch a visit in person and talk to the manager   phone calls to customer service may be less successful   if it 's not a big issue and more a minor technical policy one the bank may remove the holds   if they wo n't the manager ought to tell you why and what you can do to solve it eventually

always use limit orders never market orders period do that and you will always pay what you said you would when the transaction goes through whichever broker you use is not going to negotiate for the best price on your trade if you choose a market order   their job is to fill that order so they will always buy it for more than market and sell it for less to ensure the order goes through it is not even a factor when choosing between tradeking and scottrade i use trade king and my friend uses   besides the transaction fee tk is a few $ $ cheaper the only other things to consider are the tools and research and customer service if you need it that each site offers i went with tk and the lower transaction fee since tools and research can be had from other sources i basically only use it when i want to make a trade since i do n't find the tools particularly useful and i never take an analyst 's opinion of a stock at face value anyway since everybody always has their own agenda

if the market rate and coupon were equal the bond would be valued at face value by definition not 100 true but this is an exercise and that would be tangent to this discussion   since the market rate is higher than the coupon rate the value i am willing to pay drops a bit so my return is the same as the market rate   this can be done by hand a time value of money calculation for each payment discount by the years till received at the market rate to get the present value for each payment and sum up the numbers   the other way is to use a finance calculator and solve for rate   the final payment of $ 10,000 ignore final coupon just now is $ ^ 5 in other words that single chunk of cash is worth 10 less if it 's one year away if 2 years away etc   draw a timetable with each payment and divide by 1.1 for each year it 's away from present if the 9 coupon is really 4.5 twice a year it 's $ 450 in 6 month intervals and each 6 mo interval is really 5 you discount   short durations like this can be done by hand a 30 year bond with twice a year payments is a pain   welcome to money se

you are legally able to contribute more than 4 to your 401(k unless you 've hit the actual limit   there is no reason you need to pull out your extra contribution   so basically they just want their $ 27.50 back so offer via email or writing to send them a check   you obviously do n't work there any more so if they insist it comes from your ira or are not willing to accept a check tell them to off ok not really that would be unprofessional but that 's the general idea   they overpaid you by $ 27.50 and you are legally bound to return the extra pay but not to put up with their bs   tell them you 've offered to pay and if they do n't want to accept a check they can sue you for it to try to get it in the form they prefer which they wo n't do and even if they did at most the judge would just tell you to write a check which you offered from the outset so they 'd probably owe your legal fees

if you mostly do work for businesses individuals who are vat registered it 's a no brainer to become vat registered yourself although you will have to charge your customers vat and pass this on to hmrc because they are vat registered they will reclaim the amount so it wo n't actually cost them anything at the same time you can reclaim all the vat you 're currently being charged on your business expenditure business equipment tickets to business events business software accountancy other business services you pay for web hosting etc etc etc however if most of your clients are not vat registered it 's not worth you registering you would have to charge your customers an extra 20 and they would n't be able to claim it back and you would have to pass this on to hmrc although you could still claim for goods and services you purchase for business use essentially you 'd just be another tax collector for hmrc that said at the end of the day it 's up to you vat returns are quarterly and dead simple just keep a spreadsheet with your invoices output tax and receipts input tax and then do some basic maths to submit the final numbers to hmrc no accountant required

in case other people arrive at this page wondering whether they should enable automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for taxable non retirement accounts which is what i was searching for when i first arrived on this page you might want to review and you automatically reinvest the general idea is that assuming you plan to regularly manually rebalance your portfolio to ensure that all of the pieces of the pie are the relative sizes that you want there are approaches you can use to minimize taxes and also fees although at vanguard i do n't think that 's a concern if you choose a cost basis and manual reinvestment then you can go to change your dividends and capital gains distribution elections at

maybe in that the government gets interest on the money it takes in and has to pay interest on the money it spends or has agreed to spend pensions etc so depending on which interest rate is higher the disadvantage shifts a little   it 's also not a question of things but a tax credit would be more like taking a cut in pay rather than spending more money thinking of it as spending tax money should only be a way of helping to show that it makes this disadvantage

the only advantage of changing all your money now to the new currency is that you might get a better conversion rate now than later so you get more of the new currency and you may pay a lower percentage fee for changing a larger sum of money however regarding the better conversion rate you will not know this except with hindsight the disadvantage of changing all at once is that if you have changed too much and need to change back to your own currency or a third currency you will be charged fees and lose on the conversion rate twice if you know how long you are going to be in the new country say 12 months maybe start by converting an amount you think you will be spending in a month if you spend more then you can change a bit more the next month or if you spend less change less the next month if you find you are spending similar amounts for the next month or so then you can budget on the amount you may be spending for the remainder of your stay and then convert this amount over if you have a little left over at the end of your stay maybe reward yourself with something or buy a present for someone special back at home if you need a little more just convert this amount in the last month or so

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

how are derivatives like covered warrants or cfds different from the bucket shops that were made illegal in the us after reading up a little on the topic the core difference seems to be that bucket shops were basically running betting pools with everyone betting against the operator whereas cfds and similar derivatives are traded between speculators and the operator merely provides a market and checks the liquidity of participants a seems to be a different matter that i 'm not fully sure i understand at least the description of wikipedia seems to contradict your statement about not trade being performed on the underlying security should i worry that some regulator decides that my market maker is an illegal gambling operation not really nations with a mature financial industry like japan invariably have heavy regulations that mandate constant auditing of institutions that sell financial instruments in japan the financial services agency is in charge of this it 's almost impossible that they would let an institution operate and later decide that its basic business model is illegal what is possible are mainly two scenarios

gnucash is first and foremost just a general ledger system it tracks money in accounts and lets you make transactions to transfer money between the accounts but it has no inherent concept of things like taxes this gives you a large amount of flexibility to organize your account hierarchy the way you want but also means that it sometimes can take a while to figure out what account hierarchy you want the idea is that you keep track of where you get money from the income accounts what you have as a result the asset accounts and then track what you spent the money on the expense accounts it sounds like you primarily think of expenses as each being for a particular property so i think you want to use that as the basis of your hierarchy you probably want something like this obviously i 'm making up the specifics now when running transaction reports or income expense reports you can filter to the accounts and subaccounts of each property to get a report specific to that property you mention that you also sometimes want to run a report on all gas expenses regardless of property and that 's a bit more annoying to do you can run the report and when selecting accounts you have to select all the gas accounts individually it sounds like you 're really looking for a way to have each transaction classified in some kind of two axis system but the way a general ledger works is that it 's just a tree so you need to pick just one primary axis to organize your accounts by

the exchange rate between two currencies is simply the price that the most recent market participants were able to agree on when trading ie if the is 1.36 it 's because the last trade that happened where someone bought 1 usd cost 1.36 cad there is no one person organization which decides the rate between two currencies the rate moves you see is just the reality of money changing hands as people in various situations trade currencies for various reasons just like with stocks or any other market product foreign exchange rates can fluctuate wildly based on many things it is very difficult to forecast where rates will go because the biggest changes in rates can often be unpredictable news events for example when brexit happened the value of the gbp plummeted relative to other currencies because the market traders had less faith in the uk economy and therefore were n't willing to pay as much to buy gbp see more here there is a very high level of risk in the foreign exchange market for your sake do n't get involved in any trading that you do not well understand first

yes pmi is what the lender requires to loan you more than of the home 's value i could easily present scenarios where it 's exactly the right decision to use pmi and get the purchase done a 100 k mortgage at 90 ltv will cost you $ in pmi   if you are renting and struggling to get a higher downpayment it can take quite a long time to save the additional $ 11 k to put down only the buyer can know if the house is such s bargain or if rates have bottomed but the decision is n't so clear cut

i want to add that in my country israel the tax on cars is extraordinarily high cars in israel cost in average twice or more then in the us for example a new vw golf with the cheapest configuration costs around israel 's average salary is lower then us 's average salary and the fuel in israel costs twice therefore having a regular car in israel costs the same as having a luxury car in the us most households have a car it 's all about priorities

personally i would hold off on buying a house until you have the credit card paid down even more or paid off completely so that it is one less bill you have to worry about and once it is paid off you free up that much more money to maintain the home likewise you also have a lot of variables right now and the resolution of those variables will affect how much you can afford in the way of a home the less surprises the better as i 'm sure you know being a home owner can be quite expensive and if something ends to be repaired then you have to pay for it out of your own pocket at least when you are renting that falls onto someone else likewise unless you are confident that the market has bottomed out by you you might find that you are underwater on the mortgage once everything is said and done if you want to start making process towards buying a home though you could check to see if any of the local banks or credit unions have some sort of savings program where you get higher interest rates in exchange for designating the savings for the down payment on a mortgage likewise you could just find a high yield savings account and start making automatic transfers into it every month

take your top ten or twenty customers out to dinner one at a time along with your top sales people ask them why they do business with you and what you could be doing better do n't make any promises mind you just listen   back at the office sit down with the sales people who were at the dinner and come up with a plan to make your top customers super happy and then figure out how to package that to your mid tier customers   then fire all your worst customers they probably bring more headaches than they do profits

nobody would goto seaworld if they did n't have whale shows   that just the bottom line of reality 90 of people goto sea world because their kids want to sit in zone and see whales and jump around    if peoples kids do n't want to goto seaworld anymore they can go out on a date or something instead with that money    if they dropped the orca shows a bunch of hippie that would n't be caught dead in a sea park would be really happy and keep not going to seaworld while the thousands of children that basically keep their business afloat would rapidly loose interest and they would have to just become another 2 hours away from a bigger better six flags   i do n't like the orca shows anymore than you do but if 2 or 3 whales living in sub optimal conditions helps keep marine science research and development afloat i think it 's worth it even if their conditions where 5x shittier     seriously nobody cares about 100 's of thousands of starving children or the million people kept in a shittier tank in gaza but some uncomfortable whales that almost single keep funding up for projects that are saving millions of sea creatures are a huge deal    edit downvote me all you want it does n't make it less true that 90 of their visitors could n't give a single fuck about orca conditions

this is not an end all answer but it 'll get you started i have been through accounting courses in college as well as worked as a contractor files as sole proprietor for a few years but i am not an accountant following 's answer if you 're making that much money you should hire a bean counter to at least overlook your bookkeeping what type of business first if you 're the sole owner of the business you will most likely file as a sole proprietorship if you do n't have an official business entity you should get it registered officially asap and file under that name the problem with sole proprietorships is liability if you get sued not only are your business assets vulnerable but they can go after your personal assets too including house cars etc legally you and your business are considered one and the same to avoid liability issues you could setup a s corporation basically the business is considered it 's own entity and legal matters can only take as much as the business owns you gain more protection but if you do n't explicitly keep your business finances separate from your personal finances you can get into a lot of trouble also corporations generally pay out more in taxes technically since the business is it 's own entity you 'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary if you skip the salary and pay yourself the profits directly ie evade being taxed on income salary the irs will shut you down that 's one of the leading causes of corporations being shut down you can also pay distribute bonuses on top of that but it would be wise to burn the words within reason into your memory first the tax man gets mad if you short him on payroll taxes   s corporations are complicated if you go that route definitely seek help from an accountant bookkeeping if you 're not willing to pay a full time accountant you 'll need to do a lot of studying about how this works generally even if you have a sole proprietorship it 's best to have a separate bank account for all of your business transactions every source drain of money will fall into one of 3 categories assets what your business owns assets can be categorized by liquidity meaning how fast you can transform them directly into cash just because a company is worth a lot does n't necessarily mean it has a lot of cash some assets depreciate lose value over time whereas some are very hard to transform back into cash based on the value and/or market fluctuations like property liabilities what you owe others and what others owe you everything you owe and everything that is owed to you gets tracked just like credit cards it 's completely possible to owe more than you own as long as you can pay the interest to maintain the loans equity the net worth of the company the approach they commonly teach in schools is called double entry bookkeeping where they use the equation in practice i prefer the following because it makes more sense basically if you account for everything correctly both sides of the equation should match up if you choose to go the sole proprietorship route it 's smart to track everything i 've mentioned above but you can choose to keep things simple by just looking at your equity equity the heart of your business basically every transaction you make having to do with your business can be simplified down to debits money value increasing and credits money value decreasing for a very simple company you can assess this by looking at net profits which can be calculated with revenues are made up of money earned by services performed and goods sold expenses are made up of operating costs materials payroll consumables interest on liabilities etc basically if you brought in 250 k but it cost you 100 k to make that happen you 've made 150 k for the year in profit so for your taxes you can count up all the money you 've made revenues subtract all of the money you 've paid out expenses and you 'll know how much profit you 've made the profit is what you pay taxes on the kicker is there are gray areas when it comes to deducting expenses for instance you can deduct the expense of using your car for business but you need to keep a log and can only expense the miles you traveled explicitly for business same goes for deducting dedicated in your house basically do the research if you 're not 100 sure about a deduction if you do n't keep detailed books and try to expense stuff without proof you can get in trouble if the irs comes knocking there are always mythical stories about that one guy who wrote off his boat on his taxes but in reality you can go to jail for tax fraud if you do that it comes down to this at the end of the year if your business took in a ton of money you 'll owe a lot in taxes the better you can justify your expenses the more you can reduce that debt one last thing you 'll also have to pay your personal federal state taxes including self employment tax that means medicare social security etc if this is your first into self employment you 're probably not familiar with the fact that 1099 employers pick up 1/2 of the 15 medicare social security bill typically if you have an idea of what you make annually you should be paying this out throughout the year my pay as a contractor was always erratic so i usually paid it out once twice a year it 's better to pay too much than too little because the gov't will give you back the money you overpaid at the end of the day paying taxed sucks more if you 're self employed but it balances out because you can make a lot more money if as you said you 've broken six figures hire a damn accountant adviser to help you out and start reading when people say a business degree will help you advance in any field it 's subjects like accounting are core requirements to become a business undergrad if you do n't have time for more school and do n't want to pay somebody else to take care of it there 's plenty of written material to learn it on your own it 's not rocket surgery just basic arithmetic and a lot of business jargon ie almost as much as technology

a loan from a bank with no real purpose could be a bad idea and end up costing you more money than it needs to as someone with a loan and credit card debts accrued over university i would say avoid it if at all possible certainly do n't sign up to a large loan if you have no current plans for the money car house repair etc it sounds as though you 're fairly careful with your money but just want a bit of extra security in case a purchase you did n't account for slips by if this is the case and you 're set on obtaining a source of credit i 'd suggest getting an overdraft if you have n't already overdrafts are a lot more flexible and are better for short term debt that you plan to pay off immediately such as unexpected charges coming in at the end of the month   it 's worth mentioning that this is from the perspective of a uk banking customer overdraft conditions will vary depending on the country

i do not think the bank would consider the 52 k as equity    typically a rent to own lease is technically a lease option contract where you lease for a fixed amount and at some point during the lease you have the option to buy it at a discounted price    i think the bank would consider it a negotiated price    i know that those down payment assistance plans are considered price negotiation by the irs for the purpose of basis cost and i suspect this would be similar where your basis is $ and not $

when you itemize your deductions you get to deduct all the state income tax that was taken out of your paycheck last year not how much was owed but how much was withheld if you deducted this last year then you need to add in any amount that you received in state income tax refunds last year to your taxes this year to make up for the fact that you ended up deducting more state income tax than was really due to the state   if you took the standard deduction last year instead of itemizing then you did n't deduct your state income tax withholding last year and you do n't need to claim your refund as income this year also if you itemized but chose to take the state sales tax deduction instead of the state income tax deduction you also do n't need to add in the refund as income   for whatever reason illinois decided that you do n't get a it might be that the amount of the refund was too small to warrant the paperwork it might be that they screwed up but if you deducted your state income tax withholding on last year 's tax return then you need to add the state tax refund you got last year on line 10 of this year 's 1040 whether or not the state issued you a form or not   take a look at the line 10 instructions   starting on page 22 of the 1040 instructions to see if you have any unusual situations covered there that you did n't mention here for example if you received a refund check for multiple years last year then check your tax return from last year to verify that you deducted your state income tax withholding on schedule a. if you did then this year add the refund you got from the state to line 10 of this year 's 1040

it comes down to individual priorities   some people prefer to spend their money on a luxury car or suv rather than on computer gear a bigger house having three extra kids eating in restaurants or whatever some people are quite happy to take out a loan to get more expensive products and service that loan over several years there is also status attached to some makes e.g. german    that comes with a status premium which some people are prepared to pay for or take out debt to get and some are not     compare say a base model audi or bmw with a similarly priced non luxury model from a japanese competitor    the japanese model will probably have more features leather large safety aids etc than the european at the same price point and it will be necessary to tick several options and pay extra for them which can amount to 30 40 extra cost to get the luxury car with a comparable set of features     for some people the luxury brand is worth the difference   for some it is not

@victor above has provided a very good answer i shall try and highlight some differences the differences are specific to a country however it does offer some insight regarding the difference between investing in retirement fund vis a vis investing in stock directly in many countries the retirement fund is mandated by the govt and has to be invested in in form of direct deduction from salary ~ investing in stock is up to the individual in many cases if not most capital gain interest accrual in retirement funds are not taxable ~ depending upon current laws capital gain long term short term from stocks are taxable retirement funds are managed and are in general more stable in their returns ~ returns from direct stock investments are dependent on investment decisions of the investor retirement funds tend to though this is very country specific return somewhat less than market as an example in india public provident fund provident fund epf return tax free ~ as for direct investment on stocks nifty has returned approx 17 cagr over 15 20 years given the above if you can invest in stock by taking informed calls and you have a good understanding of the financial markets and their and probably looking at long term investment then investing directly in stock could fetch returns that might not be by retirement funds if on the other hand if you feel investing in stock is not for you then it probably is better to stick with retirement funds and other low risk investments either way you probably have to and may be you should carry some portion of your portfolio as retirement funds

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

credit unions operate for the benefit of their depositors who are the actual owners of the institution whereas conventional banks operate for the benefit of their shareholders who of course are not necessarily depositors so credit unions will typically give a benefit or service for free if it is free or extremely cheap to them whereas conventional banks will charge for it if they think it will not lose them depositors

there are a couple of things to consider    first in order to avoid interest charges you generally just need to pay the statement balance before the statement due date   this is your grace period   you do n't need to monitor your activity every day and send immediate payments   if you 're being really tight with money you can actually make a little profit by letting your cash sit in an interest bearing account before you pay your credit card before the due date second credit card interest rates are pretty terrible and prescribed minimum payments are comically low   if you buy furniture using your credit card you will pay some interest be sure to pay way more than the minimum payment   you should avoid carrying a balance on a credit card   at 20 interest the approximate monthly interest charge on $ 1,000 is $ third if you carry a balance on your credit card you lose the interest grace period the first point above on new charges   if you buy your couch and carry the balance when you buy a soda at 7 11 the soda begins to accrue interest immediately   if you decide to carry a balance on a credit card stop using that card for new charges   it generally takes two consecutive billing period full balance payments to restore the grace period fourth to answer your question using a credit card to carry a balance has no impact on your score   make your payments on time do n't exceed your limits keep your utilization reasonable   the credit agencies have no idea if you 're carrying a balance or how much interest you 're paying to appease the people who think point four needs more words your credit report contains your limit your reported balance generally your statement balance and approximate minimum payment   there is no indication related to whether or not the balance contains a carried balance and/or accrued interest   the mere fact of carrying a balance will not impact your credit score because the credit reporting bureaus do n't know you 're carrying a balance   paying interest does n't help or hurt your score   obviously if your carried balance and interest charges push your utilization up that will impact your score because of the increased utilization make your payments on time do n't exceed your limits keep your utilization reasonable and your score will be fine

the way i see it corporation tax is not fundamentally different from vat they are both a tax on revenue minus expenses just what those expenses are is different i think the main advantage of corporation tax is that it allows capital expenditure to be spread over several years although as i said this makes it more complicated and i believe that there are some capital allowances for vat as well   one advantage of vat is that sales in one country are taxed in that country before the money can be sent abroad it seems simple and fair to split the tax burden between jurisdictions according to how many sales were made in each

the reason for this is arbitrage in an free and open market investments that are certain to generate above average profits would do so by being sold cheaply while having a high return on investment after that but in a free market prices are set by supply and demand there is a high demand and little supply for investments that would certainly outperform the market the demand is in fact so high that the purchase price rises to the point of eliminating that excess return and with high frequency automated trading that price hike is instant but who would even want to sell such guaranteed in the first place of course there are uncertainties associated with stocks and individual stocks therefore move independently as the market is an average some stocks will therefore beat the market over certain time periods that 's random statistical variation the only realistic path to above average returns is to accept higher risks as discussed above nobody wants to sell you safe bets but risky bets are another matter different actors will price risk differently if you are n't worried much about risk you can pick up stocks that are cheap by your standards that is possible only because such stocks are n't cheap by risk averse standards   looking a bit deeper we see that arbitrage works in a free market because there 's essentially perfect information but risk is precisely the absence of such information and that can lead to price variations yet as the lack of information means a lack of certainty you ca n't use this to reliably beat the market

the question is how do you quantify investment risk as michael s says one approach is to treat investment returns as a random variable bill yale finance professor told me that if you accept that markets are efficient or that the price of an asset reflects it 's underlying value then changes in price represent changes in value so standard deviation naturally becomes the appropriate measure for riskiness of an asset essentially the more volatile an asset the riskier it is there is another school of thought that comes from ben graham and warren buffett which says that volatility is not inherently risky rather risk should be defined as the permanent loss of capital so the riskiness of an asset is the probability of a permanent loss of capital invested   this is easy to do in casino games based on basic probability such as    roulette or slots but what has been done with the various kinds of    investment risks my point is saying that certain bonds are low risk    is n't good enough i 'd like some numbers or at least a range of    numbers and therefore one could calculate expected payoff in the    statistics sense or can it not be done and if not why not investing is more art than science in theory a triple a bond rating means the asset is riskless or nearly riskless but we saw that this was obviously wrong since several of the aaa mortgage backed securities mbs went under prior to the recent us recession more recently the current threat of default suggests that bond ratings are not entirely accurate since us treasuries are considered riskless assets   investors often use bond ratings to evaluate investments a bond is considered investment grade if it 's or higher to adequately price bonds and evaluate risk there are too many factors to simply refer to a chart because things like the issuer credit quality liquidity risk systematic risk and risk all play a factor   another factor you have to consider is the overall portfolio markowitz showed that adding a riskier asset can actually lower the overall risk of a portfolio because of diversification this is all under the assumption that risk = variance which i think is bunk   i 'm aware that wall street is nothing like roulette but then again    there must be some math and heavy economics behind calculating risk    for individual investors this is after all what quants are paid    to do in part is it all voodoo i suspect some of it is but not all    of it quants are often involved in high frequency trading as well but that 's another note there are complicated risk management products such as the system by blackrock which incorporate modern portfolio theory markowitz fama sharpe etc and financial formulas to manage risk   's risk management covers some of the concepts applied   i also tend to think that when people point to the last x number of    years of stock market performance that is of less value than they    expect even going back to 1900 provides only 110 years of data and    in my view complex systems need more data than those data    points 10,000 years worth of data ok but not 110 any books or articles that address these issues or your own informed    views would be i fully agree with you here a lot of work is done in the santa fe institute to study complex adaptive systems and we do n't have any big clear theory as of yet conventional risk management is based on the ideas of modern portfolio theory but a lot of that is seen to be wrong behavioral finance is introducing new ideas on how investors behave and why the old models are wrong which is why i can not suggest you study risk management and risk models because i and many skilled investors consider them to be largely wrong there are many good books on investing the best of which is benjamin graham 's the intelligent investor although not a book on risk solely it provides a different viewpoint on how to invest and covers how to protect investments via a margin of safety lastly i 'd recommend against the gods by peter bernstein which covers the history of risk and risk analysis it 's not solely a finance book but rather a fascinating historical view of risk and it helps but many things in context hope it helps

as suggested above i am not questioning the validity of the study by and di i do n't doubt that there is some discount to the risk premium demanded in the market for the debt of systemically important banks    what i am is that this is a subsidy by the us government this is a subsidy by bond investors not the us government additionally it is based on the assessment of risk by those investors as there is no explicit guarantee by the us government see lehman brothers and bear stearns there is no transfer of wealth by the us government and therefore there is no active subsidy

strictly speaking the terms arise from double entry book keeping terminology and do n't exactly relate to their common english usage which is part of the confusion all double entry book keeping operations consist of a debit credit performed on two different books ledgers   the actual arithmetic operation performed by a debit or a credit depends on the book keeping classification of the ledger it is performed on liability accounts behave the way you would expect a debit is subtraction and a credit is addition asset accounts are the other way around a debit is an addition and a credit is a subtraction   the confusion when dealing with banks partly comes from this classification since while your deposit account is your asset it is the bank 's liability so when you deposit 100 cash at the bank it will perform the operation debit cash account an asset credit deposit account each ledger account will have 100 added to it similarly when you withdraw cash the operation is credit cash debit deposit however the operation that your accountant will perform on your own books is the opposite since the cash was your asset and now the deposit account is for those studying math it may also help to know that double entry book keeping is one of the earliest known examples of a single error detection correction algorithm

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

credit history is local so when you move to the us you start with the blank slate credit history length is a huge factor so in the first year expect that nobody would trust you and you may be refused credit or asked for deposits i was asked for deposits at cell phone company and refused for store cards couple of times my advice get a secured credit card that means you put certain sum of money as a deposit in the bank and you get credit equal to that sum of money and if you have something like a car loan that helps too of course you should n't buy a car just for that but if you 're buying anyway just know it 's not only hurting but also helping when you pay once you have a year or two of the history and you 've kept with all the payments you credit score would be ok and everybody would be happy to work with you in 4 5 years you can have excellent credit record if you pay on time and do n't do anything bad if you are working it the us a lot of help at first would be to take a letter from your company on an official letterhead saying that you are employed by this and that company and are getting salary of this and that that can serve as an assurance for some merchants that otherwise would be reluctant to work with you because of the absence of credit history if you have any assets overseas especially if they are held in a branch of international bank in us dollars that could help too in general do n't count too much on credit for first 1 2 years though you 'd probably could get a car loan for example but rates would be exorbitant easily 10 percentage points higher than with good credit but it will get better soon

i love giving non answer answers   it will depend on you   suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars your significant other does n't like having you drive an older car you do n't really maintain the car well it develops a variety of problems acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability   then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it on the other hand if you do n't care how the car looks it runs pretty well fewer repairs than you would expect you maintain it yourself aka cheaply and do a good job at that and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car wo n't start there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the official blue book value what others will pay so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the   the blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person it will be the discrepancy between the typical person and you that determines whether you 'll sell an illustration of this   i know a few people who 1 do n't care what their car looks like and 2 are very handy at repairs   these people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces   however even though their taste in cars did n't changes as their incomes increased it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart   that 's why this is a hard question to answer

none of your options or strategies are ideal have you considered looking at the stock chart and making a decision is the price currently up trending or is it down trending or is it going sideways as knuckle mentions you could just set a limit price order and if it does not hit by friday you can just sell at whatever price on friday however this could be very damaging if the price is currently down trending it may fall considerably by friday i think a better strategy would be to place a trailing stop loss order say 5 from the current price if the stock starts heading south you will be stopped out approximately 5 below the current price however if the price goes up your trailing stop order will move up as well always trailing 5 below the highest price reached if the trailing stop has not been hit by friday afternoon you can sell at the current price this way you will be protected on the downside only approx 5 below current price and can potentially benefit from any short term upside

long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year so the most you stand to save is $ 150 i would n't sell anything at a loss just to offset that unless you planned on selling anyways   a few reasons the long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year so your losses will be worth more next year than this year short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well so again better off saving your losses for next year you must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them but if you do n't have any capital gains you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit $ 3,000 a year iirc   so if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year fyi complete chart for capital gains tax rates is here i also posted another answer about capital gains to this question a while back that might be useful

i can safely assume that a credit union or a bank probably a bank based on the size of the short term loan would allow use of the annuity as collateral for the loan since the future payouts from the annuity will more than cover the total costs coming due for your education i 'm sure the bank will have no problem loaning the money and you can see if doing a direct payment monthly to them will reduce the rate you can try a credit union since they will most likely give you a more favorable rate if you can get a credit union to do it you will most likely be paying a lot less but typically they want interest paid monthly and not at the end of the 6 months term   there is also a service called or tuition management services which you can find at tuition management services they typically also expect monthly payments but might do an alternative for you they charge i believe a $ fee to use their service also just flat out bank shop and demand the lowest rate its guaranteed money so you should be paying libor plus 1 at most see if you can direct your next payout to them with the balance coming to you

an ideal option for you would be to use as many or as few as you choose but have all of them available to you the service desk guy told you you can do exactly that problem though you have no proof that a representative of the company told you that get proof recording written statement whatever if writing a letter make it clear you expect a response the time you spend being a good guy is not free you should get something for it no idea how to go about that mentioning the service desk guy in a letter might give him trouble maybe suggest that you could allow your image to be used in a short advertising campaign as thanks but whatever you do get enjoy it consequences any number of things can happen from lifetime free meals to court cases negative points and being banned regardless of who is right legally or morally someone in management there might still choose to burden you with responsibility even if their own ceo declared you a saint and lifetime customer of honor but you might never get to that bridge for now get proof and use what points you know are yours anyway

place your savings into safe interest bearing accounts take out the loans   keep constant track of your net worth having 100,000 $ and 80,000 $ in interest free debt is better than having   you can always convert money + debt into less money and less debt but you can not always convert less money and less debt into more money and more debt now there are risks that is why you want an interest bearing account to place your savings in to offset the debt   this minimizes the risk   it also reduces the return it is arguable that you should be at your most financially risky at a young age   i 'd argue that your future earnings are your by far largest asset at this point and as a high school student going into college those future earnings have extremely high variability your financial situation is extremely unpredictable being conservative about your high leverage student loan + education investments is probably justified   the fact you can manage arbitrage here means you should and if you are careful you can eliminate risk and get almost risk free profit from the maneuver if your money is in less than perfectly safe accounts you are now doing leveraged investing and magnifying the risk and return of said investments if your money must be spent on college or you 'll be financially punished then you may want to consider pulling it out before the last possible legal point just in case something goes wrong apparently 529 plans may not treat paying off student loans as a valid way to spend the money   you may need to talk to a lawyer or accountant about the legality of using these plans to pay off student loans and the tax penalties involved

congrats you pulled some irrelevant statistics no where in your response does it verify your claim that the majority of small businesses are n't turning a profit and many small businesses do have a multiple stakeholders   since we are on the subject do you know how large a company can be and still be classified as a small business    it is 500 1,000 or 1,500 employees depending on the industry five hundred employees is not exactly small   oh by the way i 've worked for multiple small businesses under 100 employees and they 've had owners stakeholders investors a board of directors etc on top of all of the employees not every small business is some mom and pop company of 5 15 employees   gt;then put your money where your mouth is and get out there and create some jobs   hahaha this has nothing to do with the discussion but whatever dude if we were both to start our own companies i 'd actually value my workers and you would just complain about labor costs of the people that are needed to run your business   here is the thing i do n't consider creating minimum wage jobs as true job creation because the tax payer is still footing the bill if the company is n't paying a live able news work enough to keep you off welfare and food the majority of people on welfare are working families see same link so what good is job creation of minimum wage positions if the people that work them still have to rely on the government   think about this if we were to remove the minimum wage and i could pay someone $ 1 and hour i could create jobs but we all know that is asinine because no one could live on that yet the same thing happens at the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 and people like you do n't see that there is no difference between the two examples in both scenarios people still do n't make enough to live without some assistance

this is the kind of scenario addressed by reddit 's /r personalfinance prime directive or i have $ x what should i do with it it follows a fairly linear for personal spending beginning with a budget and essential costs the gist of the is to cover your most immediate costs and risks first while also maximizing your benefits it sounds like you would fall somewhere around steps 1 and 3 step 2 wo n't apply since this is not pretax income if you do n't already have at least $ 1000 reserved in an emergency fund that 's a great place to start after that you 'll want to use the rest to pay down your debt your credit card debt is very high interest and should be treated as a financial emergency besides the balance of your gift you may want to throw whatever other funds you have saved beyond one month 's expenses at this problem as far as which card since you have multiple debts you 're faced with the classic choice of which payoff method to use snowball lowest balance first or avalanche highest interest rate first avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately personally since your 26 apr debt is so large and so high interest i would recommend focusing every available penny on that card until it is paid off and then never use it again again per the that means using everything left over after steps 0 2 are fulfilled

you can use 's gambit to convert between usd and cad either direction i have never personally done this but i am planning to convert some cad to usd soon so i can invest in usd index funds without paying the typical 2 conversion fee   you must be okay with waiting a few days for the trades to settle and okay with the fact that the exchange rate will almost certainly change before you sell the shares in the opposite currency the spread on is about 0.01 0.02 and you also have brokerage commissions and fees if you use a discount broker the commissions and fees can be quite low eg to transfer $ 5000 usd to cad using questrade you would deposit the usd into a questrade account and then purchase units of since it is an etf there is no commission on the purchase then you request that they journal the shares over to and you sell them in cad will have about a $ 5 fee in cad and lose about $ 1 on the spread and withdraw the whole thing will have cost you $ 6 cad in lieu of ~$100 you would pay if you did a straightforward conversion with a 2 exchange fee the difference in fees scales up as the amount you transfer increases someone has posted the chat log from when they requested their shares be from to here it looks like it was quite straightforward of course there is a time cost and the nuisance of signing up for an maintaining an account with a broker if you do n't have one already you can do it on non discount brokers but it will only be worth it to do it with a larger amount of money since the commissions are larger note if you have enough room to hold the cad amount in your tfsa and will still have that much room at the end of the calendar year i recommend doing the exchange in a tfsa account the taxes are minimal unless the exchange rate changes drastically while your trades are settling from capital gains or losses while waiting a few days for the trades to settle but they are annoying to calculate if you do it often warning if you do it in a tfsa be sure not to over contribute every time you deposit counts as a contribution and your withdrawals do n't count against the limit until the next calendar year

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

you want to buy a house for $ 150,000   it may be possible to do this with $ 10,000 and a 3.5 downpayment but it would be a lot better to have $ 40,000 and make a 20 downpayment   that would give you a cushion in case house prices fall and there are often advantages to a 20 downpayment lower rate less mandatory insurance    you have an income of $ 35,000 and expenses of $ 23,000 if you are careful with the money what if you are n't   you should have savings of either $ 17,500 or $ 11,500 in case of emergencies   perhaps you simply were n't mentioning that   note that you also need at least $ 137 26 = $ more to cover mortgage payments so $ by the expenses standard   this is in addition to the $ 40,000 for downpayment and closing costs    what do you plan to do if there is a problem with the new house e.g. you need a new roof   or smaller expenses like a new furnace or appliance   a plumbing problem   damages from a storm   what if the tenants teenage child has a party and the place   what if your tenants stop paying rent but refuse to move out trashing the place while being evicted   your emergency savings need to be able to cover those situations    you checked comps comparable properties   great   but notice that you are looking at a one bathroom property for $ 150,000 and comparing to $ 180,000 houses   consider that you may not get the $ 235 for that house which is cheaper   perhaps the rent for that house will only be $ or less because one bathroom does n't really support three bedrooms of people    while real estate can be part of a portfolio balance would suggest that much more of your portfolio be in things like stocks and bonds   what are you doing for retirement   are you maxing out any tax advantaged options that you have available   it might be better to do that before entering the real estate market    i am a 23 year old australian man with a degree in computer science and a steady job from home working as a web developer i 'm a bit unclear on this   what makes the job steady   is it employment with a large company   are you self employed with what has been a steady flow of customers   regardless of which it is consider the possibility of a recession   the company can lay you off presumably you are at the bottom of the seniority   the new customers may be reluctant to start new projects while their cash flow is restrained   and your tenants may move out   at the same time   what will you do then    a mortgage is an obligation   you have to pay it regardless   while currently flush are you the kind of flush that can weather a major setback   i would feel a lot better about an investment like this if you had $ 600,000 in savings and were using this as a complementary investment to broaden your portfolio   even if you had $ 60,000 in savings and would still have substantial savings after the purchase   this feels more like you are trying to maximize your purchase   money burning a hole in your pocket and trying to escape    it would be a lot safer to stick to securities   the worst that happens there is that you lose your investment and it 's more likely that the value will be reduced but recover   with mortgages you can lose your entire investment and then some   yes the price may recover but it may do so after the bank forecloses on the mortgage

first keep in mind that there are generally 2 ways to buy a corporation 's shares you can buy a share directly from the corporation this does not happen often it usually happens at the initial public offering the first time the company becomes public where anyone with access to the stock exchange can become a part owner plus maybe a few more times during the corporations existence in this case the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation   the price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get this is a very complicated field and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth if the company sets the price too low then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous private shareholders they would have gotten the same share of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend because of increased money paid by new shareholders if the company sets the price too high then the share subscription might only be partially filled so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted you can buy a share from another shareholder this is more common when you see the company 's share price on the stock exchange it is this type of transaction buying out other current shareholders the price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at the bid price listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share the ask price is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own when the bid price = the ask price a share transaction happens and the most recent stock price changes

when you buy a put option you 're buying the right to sell stock at the strike price to understand why you have to pay separately for that consider the other side of the transaction if i agree to trade stock for money at above market rates i need to make up the difference somewhere or face bankruptcy   that risk of loss is what the option price is about you might assume that means the market expects the price of amd to fall to from it 's current price of by the option expiration date but that would also mean call options below the market price is worthless but that 's not quite true people who price options need to factor in volatility since things change with time the price might fall and traders need to account for that risk so roughly represents the probability of amd rising to 10 there 's probably some technical analysis one can do to the chain but i do n't see any of amd here

i just went through this and life insurance money generally does not go into probate however since there was no beneficiary you will have to ask the probate court i would advise you not to spend any of the money yet make a meeting with the probate court in the county where they lived you will need the death certificate and the will if you do not have a will the estate generally does not need to go into probate but if it does then they will definitely let you know what to do with the insurance money just make sure you use the estate accounts to pay off all of his debts before you distribute the left over money the entire process should take an absolute minimum of 6 months

you are making an assumption that the house will appreciate in the short term which there is no way you can know   you will probably take a bath financially selling a house after one year into a mortgage even if you sell it for what you paid for it if there is any chance you might relocate back it is definitely worth keeping it otherwise i 'd say cut your losses the only upside might be if you could rent it out keeping in mind that you generally need to rent for about double your mortgage payment to get positive cash flow letting it sit empty while you wait for it to appreciate is undoubtedly going to cost you big time

if the checking account is in a fdic insured bank or a ncua insured credit union then you do n't have to worry about what happens if the bank goes out of business in the past the government has made sure that any disruption was minimal the fraud issue can cause a bigger problem if they get a hold of your debit card they can drain your account yes the bank gives you fraud protection so that the most you can lose is $ 50 or $ 500 many even make your liability $ 0 if you report it in a timely manor but there generally is a delay in getting the money put back in your account one way to minimize the problem is to open a savings account it also has the fdic and ncua coverage the account may even earn a little interest if you do n't allow the bank to automatically provide an overdraft transfer from savings to checking account then the most they can temporarily steal is your checking account balance getting a credit card can provide additional protection it also limits your total losses if there is fraud the bill is only paid once a month so if they steal the card or the number they wo n't be able to drain the money in the bank account   the credit card if used wisely can also start to build a positive credit file so that in a few years you can get a loan for a car or a place to live of course if they steal your entire wallet with both the credit and the debit card

i agree the state should provide defense legal system police and can even provide some welfare our current financial system is the most regulated entity in the world and could never survive without government subsidies i think we would be better off letting all the banks fail once and then let entrepreneurs build a better safer financial system possibly with cryptocurrencies rather than a central bank run that has to be tightly regulated and regularly bailed out regarding businesses it is a free choice for anyone to work somewhere if i start a business and offer to hire you for a fixed rate you can agree you can also start a different business and compete even the largest businesses can lose market share to tiny one man businesses just look at how some one man craft breweries have started taking market share from the largest breweries in the world and how the large newspapers are being overturned by facebook which started as just a few guys in a dorm if you join a small business to work you can choose to go in as a partner where you share in the profits and gain a say but also make 0 money or even lose money if the business does n't do well some are willing to take this risk other 's like myself prefer to get a fixed salary if you want to start a company that is democratic and every worker has an equal say you are also free to do this supposedly you could then attract better workers for cheaper and all make more money problem is that for most people it is too risky to own part of the company they work in as if the company goes bust they lose their job and savings simultaneously and thus people go for the option of having a job and investing their savings in their property and some diversified investments

quid 's answer explains the settlement period well however it should be noted that you can avoid the settlement period by opening a margin account any specific broker like schwab may or may not offer margin accounts margin accounts allow you to borrow money to avoid the settlement period or to buy more securities than you can actually afford note that if you buy more securities than you can afford using margin you expose yourself to losses potentially larger than your initial investment if you fund your account with $ 50,000 and use margin to purchase $ 80,000 of stock which then drops in value by 80 you will have lost $ and owe the broker $ 14,000 plus fees

but what i really want to know is it illegal particularly the    clause requiring a trade in to qualify for the advertised price the price is always net of all the parts of the deal as an example they gave the price if you have $ 4000 trade in if you have no trade in or a trade in worth less than 4 k your final price for the new car will be more of course how do you know that the trade in value they are giving you is fair it could be worth 6 k but they are only giving you a credit of 4k. if you are going to trade in a vehicle while buying another vehicle the trade in should be a separate transaction i always get a price quote for selling the old car before visiting the new car dealer i do that to have a price point that i can judge while the pressure is on at the dealership buying a car is a complex deal the price interest rate length of loan and the value of the trade in are all moving parts it is even more complex if a lease is involved they want to adjust the parts to be the highest profit that you are willing to agree to while you think that you are getting a good deal this is the fine print all advertised amounts include all hyundai incentives rebates dealer    discounts and $ 2500 additional down from your trade in value + 0 apr    for 72 months on select models subject to credit approval through    no payments or 90 days subject to credit approval value will be added to end of loan balance price excludes tax title    license doc and dealer fees msrp $ $ dealer discount    $ 500 hma lease cash $ 500 hma value owner coupon $ 1000 hma retail    bonus cash $ 500 hma military rebate $ 500 hma competitive owner    coupon $ 400 hma college grad rebate $ 500 hma boost program $ 4000    trade allowance = net price $ on approved credit certain    qualifications apply to each rebate see dealer for details payment    is 36 month lease with $ 0 due at signing no security deposit    required all payment and prices include hma college grad rebate hma    military rebate hma competitive owner coupon and hma valued owner    coupon must be active military or spouse of same to qualify for hma    military rebate must graduate college in the next 6 months or within    the last 2 years to qualify for hma college grad rebate must own    currently registered hyundai to qualify for hma valued owner coupon    must own qualifying competitive vehicle to qualify for hma competitive    owner coupon

there 've certainly been lots of problems with unions but no greater than with the businesses or agencies they bargain with     there is constant push in both directions getting rid of them will just allow companies to run over workers like they did before and since legislation is as much a commodity as anything else these days they 'll just stretch or change laws that impede them if they 're not stopped      they 're not obsolete because the need never goes away because one employer or another is always looking for ways to exploit amp endanger his employees to improve his margins    no not all employers will do this but not all unions are or ever were bad either and unlike unions companies actually get a short term competitive advantage from squeezing their staffs which means bad actors have a significant chance of out good ones   in the long term balance between labor amp capital benefits everyone imbalance looks good in the short term but eventually blows up    both sides will always seek it 's their so both sides need strong counterbalance     labor was strong for a fleeting while but now the pendulum swings back

if financial modelling projections and market research were effective enough that they could predict with certainty what the price would do tomorrow then everyone would use those techniques buy now and make relatively risk free profit tomorrow though right the point of an efficient market is that the price at any particular point in time incorporates all of the information available to the market at that moment given that the price should be just as likely to go up tomorrow as go down    whether it 's reasonable to assume that the market is efficient is another question at the very least though i think it 's reasonable to assume that people armchair investing at home do n't have access to information that professional investors do n't

i like the answers others gave if it 's some substantial debt you definitely could go the bankruptcy route but it damages your future also it 's morally unethical to borrow all that money and not intend to pay second if you can pay off the entire balance and clear out the 23 interest than i 'd do that first one less bill to concern yourself with now let 's say you 've been making $ 100 payments monthly on each card my assumption for this examples sale now instead of paying $ 100 to the remaining cards balance each month and saving the other $ 100 pay $ 200 against the remaining credit cards balance by not taking home any money this way you are tackling the liability that is costing you money every month unless you have a great investment opportunity on that remaining $ 1000 or have n't created much of an emergency fund yet i 'd consider putting more of that money towards the debt gaining 0.01 on savings interest still means you 're eating in debt monthly if you 're able to i 'd venture out to open a zero interest card and do a balance transfer over to that new card there will be a minimal transfer fee but you may get some cash back out of it and also that zero interest for a year would help hold off more interest accruing while you 're tackling the balance

if you 're willing to do a little more work and bookkeeping than just putting money into the 401(k i would recommend the following i note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high i would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw   past performance is no guarantee of future returns assuming the cash in your ally account is an emergency fund i would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level if the ally account is not an emergency fund i would make it one with no debt and an emergency fund for 3 12 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance then you can concentrate on investing your 401(k options are unfortunately pretty poor with those choices i would invest this way once you fill up your choice of ira then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any a brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency the 401(k will give you tax benefits but high fund expenses the tax benefits are considerable so if i were at a job where i plan on moving on in a few years i 'd fund the 401(k up to the max with the knowledge that i 'd roll the 401(k into a rollover ira in the relatively short term if i saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 + years i 'd probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time one you start building up a solid base then i might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for play money to pick individual stocks or start making sector bets

stock prices reflect future expectations of large groups of people and may not be directly linked to traditional valuations for a number of reasons not definitive for example a service like twitter is so popular that even though it has no significant revenue and loses money people are simply betting that it is deeply embedded enough that it will eventually find some way to make money you can also see a number of cases of ipos of various types of companies that do not even have a revenue model at all also if there is rapid sales growth in a but b sales are flat no one is likely to expect future profit growth in b such that the valuation will remain steady if sales in a are accelerating there may be anticipation that future profits will be high sometimes there are also other reasons such as if a owns valuable proprietary assets that will hold the values up however more information about these companies financials is really needed in order to understand why this would be the case
