would you consider the owner of a company to be supporting the company if you buy stock in the company you own a small part of that company your purchase also increases the share price and thus the value of the company increased value allows the company to borrow more money to say expand operations the affect that most individuals might have on share price is very very small that does n't mean it is n't the right thing for you to do if it is something you believe in after all if enough people followed those same convictions it could have an impact on the company

we 're not helping the company in a comparable sense to donating money to a non profit   as you wrote investing in a company deals with ownership and in a sense becoming a part owner of a company even if it is a minor ownership indicates that we sense it has some sort of value whether that 's ethical financial or tangible value   as investors we should take responsibility and ensure that our voices are heard when voting occurs sadly not too common edit makes an excellent point that this paragraph only applies to ipos keep in mind when we purchase stock in a company that money is used for business purposes   it also signals value to the market as well if enough money or enough investors buy the stock

as others have said it simply makes you a part owner even if you have ethical objections to a company 's behavior i 'd argue that investing in it and using the proxy votes to influence the company 's decisions might be even more ethical than not investing

as said by others buying shares of a company will not support it directly but let 's think about two example companies company a which has 90 stocks owned by supporters and company b which has only 1 of stocks owned by supporters both companies release bad news for example profits have decreased in company b most investors might want to sell their stock quickly and the price will plummet in company a the supporters continue believing in the company and will not want to sell it the price will drop less usually but it can drop even more if the sellers of company a are very desperate to get rid of the stock so why is it important for the company to have a high stock price in the short term it 's not important one example is that the company can release more stocks and receive more financing by doing that other reasons are listed here

the number one reason to borrow is quite simple when you have no other choice the primary reason to do this is when renovations or additions must be made in a timeframe that precludes you being able to save enough money to pay cash 's example of a kid on the way with no space to put him is a very good hypothetical disaster recovery is another insurance does n't cover everything and can sometimes be slow to pay out and even if the payoff will rebuild the house exactly the way it was these situations are good opportunities to improve on what you had since you already have to call in the contractors to demo and rebuild the cost to do that is sunk and the incremental cost of improvements or even additional square footage is relatively minor other acceptable reasons to borrow are when cost of capital is very cheap a typical amortized heloc is pretty expensive when paid on schedule but if you can pay it off very early i.e. when you sell the home next month or you get a good deal on the interest rate a subsidized disaster recovery loan perhaps you have to be careful with these as they 're not intended to turn a burnt down into a mcmansion the cost of borrowing can be acceptable even if you had cash savings for the project you have other uses for the cash that can offset cost of borrowing this generally requires the first point to be true as well as it 's a general rule that borrowing $ 10,000 costs you more than you would gain by investing $ 10,000 but there are situations in which the reverse can be true if you have $ 10k in oil or major tech stocks right now it would probably be a bad move to liquidate them for home improvements if you can get a heloc at less than 6 you can realize a net gain in home value from the reno these situations are rare in cases of an already livable home flippers which make their living on renovating homes for a profit generally choose homes with obvious but easy to fix problems that depress home value because they look worse than they are if you bought your home without any such problems you probably paid something close to market value at the time and so you 're probably behind the curve however if you or your family in the case of an estate transfer have owned the home for a long time long enough for things to fall way out of date then you can catch up a lot of market value with one renovation where if the home had had two or three renovations along the way a reno now would n't gain you as much value

@littleadv has said most of what i 'd say if they had not gotten here first i 'd add this much it 's important to understand what debt collectors can and can not do because a lot of them will use intimidation and any other technique you can think of to get away with as much as you will let them i 'd start with this pdf file from the ftc and then start googling for info on your state 's regulations also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default   the fee 's the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable or it might be something you already agreed to in you little recourse but to pay them do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10   on a debt of your size paid off over several years that might amount to more than the $ 4 k they are adding   otoh you can pretty much expect them to try both tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid    another source of assistance may be the department of education ombudsman if you need help with a defaulted student loan contact the department of education 's ombudsman at or visit its website at but first you must take steps to resolve your loan problem on your own there is a checklist of required steps on the website or the ombudsman will not assist you

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

this is a wonderful comprehensive answer as it relates to transferring goods and evaluating profitability i would like to add to your post and comment about a few other costs that are transferred   first though i disagree with your comment about transfer pricing being about opportunity cost i think transfer pricing is first and primarily about the matching principal properly matching expenses incurred to the revenues generated from those expenditures or in the case of period expenses to those entities that received a benefit in the proper period i do n't work in tax so i 'm by no means an expert in this subject but i am a cpa and i feel i have a solid understanding of the subject   some additional items going through tp might be interest shared corporate services the amortization of intellectual property technology fees and depreciation charges this is not a comprehensive list and please do n't take it as such    none of these need apply to every company and certain industries and even individual companies will have exceptions for example for various reasons a multi national conglomerate may choose to maintain separate treasury functions for it 's vastly different businesses so you may not see much interest tp    interest is pretty straight forward and is the interest a company is paying on a debt not all interest is transferable but a classic example might be borrowed funds used for an acquisition the interest cost associated with that should be transferred in part back to the original entity short term borrowing costs used for operating capital is another classic example    shared corporate services are centralized functions like a legal department accounting department executive offices and the like this can also be an it department or in the instance of an international website maybe google an operations team monitoring the server loads and up times   ip could just be patents that have definite lives that a number of businesses are benefiting from ip is a bit of a mess to get into for various reasons and i 'm trying to stay focused in this post some reasons for complexity include the valuation life of the asset benefit of use is the entity even really using it etc i would imagine this is where companies get away with a lot    technology fees can be software licenses windows ai n't free   depreciation can be capitalized proprietary software   i 'm running out of gas and wanted to comment about op 's question    i do n't think sla 's and internal billing services are a matter of directly increasing efficiency more a matter of not creating inefficiencies going anecdotal anywhere i 've worked the best person to do the job has been whoever 's closest to the work it would n't make much sense to me   to have accounting gather up internal support during the very time sensitive month end close for something like one division 's trade magazine that another division placed an ad in on the other hand i think the allocation of copy expenses on an activity basis is an absolute waste of time it all depends on the specific transaction in question   great post do n't mean to detract just looking to help others understand

options have legitimate uses as a way of hedging a bet but in the hands of anyone but an expert they 're gambling not investing they are extremely volatile compared to normal stocks and are one of the best ways to lose your shirt in the stock market yet invented how options actually work is that you 're negotiating a promise that at some future date or range of dates they will let you purchase some specific number of shares call or they will let you sell them that number of shares put at a price specified in the option contract the price you pay or are paid to obtain that contract depends on what the option 's seller thinks the stock is likely to be worth when it reaches that date note that if you do n't already own the shares needed to back up a put option you 're promising to pay whatever it takes to buy those shares so you can sell them at the agreed upon price note that by definition you 're betting directly against experts as opposed to a normal investment where you 're usually trying to ride along with the experts you are claiming that you can predict the future value of the stock better than they can and that you will make a profit on the difference between the value locked in by the option and the actual value at that time which exceeds the cost of purchasing the option in the first place   let me say that again the option 's price will have been set based on an expert 's opinion of what the stock is likely to do in that time if they think that it 's really likely to be up $ 10 per share when the option comes due really unlikely for a $ 20 stock they will try to charge you almost $ 10 per share to purchase the option at the current price almost because you 're giving them a guaranteed profit now and assuming all the risk if they 're less sure it will go up that much you 'll pay less for the option but again you 're giving them hard money now and betting that you can predict the probabilities better than they can unless you have information that the experts do n't have in which case you 're probably committing insider trading this is a very hard bet to win and it can be extremely misleading since the price during the option period may cross back and forth over the enough that you 'll make a profit line many times until you actually commit to exercising the option or not that 's all imaginary money which may vanish the next minute unless you are willing and able to invest pro level resources in this you 'd probably get better odds in atlantic city and definitely get better odds in las vegas if you do n't see the sucker at the poker table he 's sitting in your seat and betting against the guy who designed and is running the game is usually not a good idea

gt a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing     gt d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know

the key difference i 've found between a stock split and a stock dividend of the exact same stock and class as opposed to a spin off seems to be from the company 's own accounting perspective   there does n't appear to be any actual transfer of value to the shareholder with either kind of transaction i.e. in theory each transaction would be immaterial to the value of your holdings with respect to the company 's accounting a stock split affects the par value of the shares whereas a stock dividend reduces the retained earnings account in order to increase paid in or contributed capital i found a good online source which explains the history behind this accounting difference hill intermediate accounting ebook chapter 18 stock dividends and splits small quote    besides being based on fallacious reasoning accounting for stock    dividends by artificially earned capital as invested    capital conflicts with the reporting objective of reporting    shareholders equity by source despite these limitations this    outdated accounting standard still applies since neither the corporation nor its shareholders apparently benefits    from stock dividends why do companies declare occasionally a    company tries to give shareholders the illusion that they are    receiving a real dividend another reason is merely to enable the corporation to take advantage    of the accepted accounting practice of capitalizing retained earnings    specifically a company might wish to reduce an existing balance in    retained earnings otherwise available for cash dividends so it can    reinvest the earned assets represented by that balance without    carrying a large balance in retained earnings there 's a lot more on that page before and after worth reading from another book google books comparative income taxation a structural analysis page stock dividends small quote the distribution of dividends in the form of stock or bonus shares    to existing shareholders typically involves a transfer for corporate    law purposes of retained earnings into stated capital    it can been sic viewed as a deemed distribution of a cash    dividend to the shareholders followed by a corresponding contribution    to capital or as solely as an event at the corporate level which has    no effect on the shareholders whose economic interest in the    corporation is unchanged by the receipt of additional shares the    systems have taken varied approaches to the stock dividend problem     the treatment is in part a function of the rules dealing with    distributions of stated capital above are mine continues w descriptions of different countries tax treatments of the kinds of stock dividends includes u.s. sweden japan    netherlands canada australia u.k. france germany as far as why a corporation might want to capitalize earnings and reduce the equity otherwise available for dividends i can only imagine that ignoring taxes for a moment that it may have something to do with capital ratios that need to be maintained for financing or regulatory purposes   yet i remain curious if i discover more on this then i 'll update my answer additional resources

this is not a full answer and i have no personal finance experience but i have a personal story as i did this as stated another point there are various schemes available to help first time    buyers by signing up for this you would exclude yourself from any of    those schemes in the future i did this for my dad when i was 16 or so i am in canada and lost $ 5,000 first time buyers tax rebate as long as many other bonuses like using your for your first home i also am having a fair amount of trouble getting a credit card because even though i am only a part member of the mortgage they expect you to be able to cover the whole thing so when the banks look at my income of say $ 3000 a month they say 3000 you make $ a month i then explain that i do not actually pay the mortage so it is not coming out of my paycheck they do not care i am responsible for full payments and they consider it used

most of the time when a stock splits to create more shares it is done to bring the price per share down to a level that makes potential investors more comfortable there are psychological reasons why some companies keep the price in the $ 30 to $ 60 range others like to have the price keep rising into the hundreds or thousands a share   the split does n't help current investors with the possible exception that the news spurs interest in the stock which leads to a short term rise in prices but it also does n't hurt current investors when a reverse stock split is done the purpose is for one of several reasons

when you buy a property the house or the building goes down in value every year it gets depreciated similar to when you drive a new car out of the lot however it is the land that increases in value over time as land becomes the value of land in that area will increase in value as does land in sought after areas if more people want to live in a particular suburb the land value will keep on increasing year after year sometimes established areas with houses built in the 1980s or even earlier can be worth much more than newly built areas it comes down to the supply and demand of land and houses in a particular area you might even get a situation where a run down dilapidated house in a very sought after suburb sells for more than a brand new house in a less sought after suburb nearby properties can be a very good investment and they can be a very poor investment it can largely depend on the decisions you make in buying your investment property the first thing you need to make a decision on is the location of the property if you buy a property in a good area that is well sought after you can make good capital and rental returns over the long run if you buy poorly in an area no one wants to live in then you might have problems renting it out or only be able to rent it out to bad tenants who cause damage and you may not get any capital gains over many years the second thing you need to decide on is when in the property cycle you buy the property if you buy at the right time you can get higher rents and make some quick capital gains over a relatively short time i can provide a personal example of this situation i had bought a house in australia in 2007 for $ 240,000 at a time when interests where at their highest 9 no one was buying property and rents were on the increase with low vacancy rates today eight years after we are getting $ 410 per week rent and the house next door in worse condition than ours has been put on the market asking for between $ 500,000 to $ most houses in the area had been selling during this year for over $ 500,000 so you can say that our house has more than doubled in 8 years however up to a few months ago houses were selling within 2 weeks of being listed the house next door however has been listed for over a month and has not had very much interest so from this you can conclude that in 2007 we had bought near the bottom of the market whilst now we are near the top of the market what you also need to remember is that different areas of a country can have different cycles so there is not just one property cycle but many property cycles in the same country

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

the opposite of an economic bubble is a bubble burst :p jokes aside though an economic bubble occurs when the economy is in bull market mode and asset prices are growing very fast it 's usually measured by ratio 's like price to earnings and the levels of various market indices so the opposite would be when valuations are falling very fast or are very low and price to earnings ratios are low   this condition is usually a recession a recession is a market slowdown generally after a bubble bursts and severe recessions can become depressions if they last long enough great depression 1930s   a bubble is not necessarily negative stock prices usually rise a lot so paper wealth is greatly magnified if you can get out in time you 're golden similarly a recession is n't bad for everyone some investors keep large amounts of cash waiting for recessions so they can buy low sell high for most people however recessions are negative because unemployment increases and some people get fired and the economy slows down asset prices have fallen so their investments are worth less than they used to be on paper and people mainly have to it out until the market starts growing again

the wells fargo scandal was and still is a big deal because wells fargo opened over 1.5 million unauthorized bank and credit card accounts the credit card accounts were opened without authorization which means people 's credit scores and reports were pulled without permission that is considered fraud and identity theft other than the legal side of it by opening more bank accounts without authorization it was showing synthetic growth which resulted in an inflated number when quarterly and annual performance numbers were reported this caused people to invest more in wells fargo stock not knowing that the growth in stock was not organic after the scandal was uncovered stocks decreased however the root cause of this can be traced to the culture at wells fargo where customer service reps i.e. bank tellers and store operations employees were faced with the challenges of meeting quotas that could be considered a stretch as a result faced with pressure from upper management they opened unauthorized accounts   in addition these unauthorized accounts cost consumers money either because credit cards had balances or bank accounts did not meet a minimum balance it is not about ending up with 8 rows in their database instead of just 1 row as op wrote it is about stealing consumer money and committing fraud and stealing the consumer 's identity   suggestions and constructive criticism are welcomed in improving my answer

as the european crisis worsened the swiss franc chf was seen as a safe currency so europeans attempted to exchange their euros for francs   this caused the franc to appreciate in value against the euro through the summer and fall of 2011   the swiss government and swiss central bank snb believe will create wealth for the citizens of switzerland   the swiss central planners believe that having an abundance of export businesses in switzerland will create wealth for the citizens of switzerland as the exporters sell their good and services abroad and pocket a bunch of cash   thus the central planners tend to favor exporters   from the article at the start of the year when exporters urged for government and snb action the swiss central bank continued to intervene in currency markets in 2011 to prevent the chf from appreciating   this was done to prevent a decrease in export business   finally after many failed attempts they announced the 1.20 peg in september    the central planners give little consideration to imports however since manufacturers in foreign countries do n't vote or contribute to the campaign funds of the central planners in switzerland   as the chf strengthened many imported items became very cheap for swiss citizens   this was of little concern to the central planners currencies are like other goods in a market in that they respond to supply and demand   their value can change daily or even hourly based on the continually varying demands of people   this can cause the exchange rate to rise and fall against other currencies and goods   central planners mistakenly believe that the price of certain market items like currency should not fluctuate   the believe there is some magical number that will cause the market to operate better or more correctly how does the snb maintain the peg   they maintain the peg by printing francs and purchasing euros

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

well they do n't make money in the sense of income but they receive money in exchange for shares of stock more of the company is owned by the public   the warrant entitles the holder to purchase stock directly from the company at a fixed price   it is very much like an open market call option but instead of the option holder buying stock from a third party which does not affect the company at all the holder buys it directly from the company increasing the number of shares outstanding and the proceeds go directly to the company if the holders do not exercise the warrants the company does not receive any cash but they also do n't issue any new shares

this is largely a cultural issue i would be appalled at the very idea that my parents would charge me interest for lending me money just as they would be appalled if i were to do so if lending them money i find the idea of attempting to make money off of your children fundamentally wrong   i realize that you only want to do this to teach them that you have their best interests in mind and not your own profit nevertheless what will actually happen were you to charge them interest is that you would accrue a monetary gain at the expense of your children is that really something you would be comfortable with now as i stated at the beginning this is clearly a cultural issue based on the other answers here many cultures probably including your own find nothing wrong with this i 've even heard of people charging their adult children rent when they come home for the holidays something that is completely baffling to me   the point i am trying to make is that asking other people 's opinions on whether you should do this is not very useful unless those people share your own cultural background my family and culture are such that the idea of charging interest to one 's family members seems downright immoral to me given that you are asking here it seems like you might be on the fence about it yourself however i freely admit that my answer is colored by my own cultural and may very well not be applicable to you   still ask yourself is a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of things or for that matter an entire fortune worth your relationship with your children do you really believe that having their parents retroactively charge them interest for a loan will somehow teach them something about the real world that your already adult children do n't know one of the main reasons they came to you and did n't go to a bank is precisely that they expected the loan to be interest free   so sure tell them that you wo n't lend any more until they repay what they owe even better sit them down and have an honest adult conversation explaining that the absence of the money they owe is making itself felt in your household and work out a way they can repay you   what in my opinion you most certainly should n't do is treat your relationship with your children as a regular business transaction it is n't and i am sure you do n't want it to be

this would be my suggestion i would approach the problem thinking about the loss of monthly income you as a couple will be facing due to your wife 's change to a part time job and divide that loss between the two of you this means that if she goes from 2200 to 1100 monthly you 'd be losing 1100 per month   to share this loss you could repay your wife your part of the loss 550 so both of you are 550 euro down however this 550 loss is a bigger burden for your wife than it is for you so this amount could be adjusted to make up for this inequality   to make calculations simple and avoid developing a complicated model you could give the 800 euro above your 3k to your wife for as long as she has to work part time

in the case of reward cards different cards may offer different rewards for different kind of purchases for example in the uk one of the amex cards offers 1.25 cashback on all purchases whereas one of the santander cards offers 3 on fuel 2 or 1 on certain other transactions and nothing on others of course you then have to remember to use the right card another reason is that a person may use a card for a while build up a good credit limit and then move to a different card perhaps because it has better rewards or a lower interest rate etc without cancelling the first if it costs nothing to keep the first card then it can be useful to have it as a spare

from a budgeting perspective the emergency fund is a category in which you 've budgeted funds for the unexpected   these are things that were n't able to be predicted and budgeted for in advance or things that exceeded the expected costs   for example you might budget $ 150 per month for car maintenance and typically spend some of it while the rest builds up over time for unexpected repairs so you have a few hundred available for that   but this month your transmission died and you have a $ 3,000 bill you 'll then fund most of this out of your emergency fund   this does n't cover where to store that money though which leads me to my next point   emergencies are emergencies because they come without warning without you having a chance to plan the primary things you want in an emergency fund account are stability and quick access   you can structure investments to be whatever you think of as safe or stable but you do n't want to be thinking about whether it 's a good time to sell when you need the money right now   but the bigger problem is access when you need the funds on a weekend holiday anytime outside of market hours you 're not going to be able to just sell some stocks and go to an atm this is the reason why it 's recommended to have these funds in a checking or savings account usually the reason i mentioned the budgeting side first is because i wanted to point out that if you 're budgeting well most of the unexpected expenses you have should have been expected in a sense you can still plan for something without knowing when or if it will happen   so in the example of a car repair ideally you 're already budgeting for possible repairs if you own a home you 're budgeting for things that would go wrong budgeting for speeding tickets for surprise out of pocket medical costs etc these then become part of your normal budget they are n't part of the emergency fund anymore   the bright side about budgeting for something unexpected is that you know what that money is for and do you likely also know how quickly you 'll need it for example you know if you have unexpected medical costs that happen very quickly you 're not likely you need a bag of cash on a moment 's notice   so those last two points lead to the fact that your actual emergency fund the dollars that are for things you simply could not foresee will be relatively small a few thousand dollars or so in most cases if you 've got things structured like this you 'll be happy to have a few grand available at a moment 's notice   the bulk of the money you would use for other surprise expenses or things like 6 months of living expenses is represented in other specific categories and you already know the timeframe in which you need it probably enough time that it could be invested risk to taste in short by expecting the unexpected you can sidestep this issue and not worry so much about missed returns on the emergency fund

a long straddle using equity would be more akin to buying a triple leveraged etf and an inverse triple leveraged etf only because one side will approach zero while the other can theoretically increase to infinity in a short time span before time decay hits in the reason your analogy fails is because the delta is 1.0 on both sides of your trade at the money options a necessary requirement for a straddle have a delta of .5 there is an options strategy that uses in the money calls and puts with a delta closer to 1.0 to create an in the money strangle i 'm not sure if it is more similar to your strategy an analogous options strategy would be better than yours as it would not share the potential for a margin call

have a bank account here you need to have a credit history that is wrong whoever informed you that you do n't need a credit history to open a bank account some banks allow you to open no frills accounts without a credit history i myself opened an account with barclays with my ni card job contract and probably my passport too and i from the eu also the bank that allowed me to open the account does n't allow me to wire transfer my money to another uk account and claims that ll the bank have the same policy for cash accounts is that true i mean is there an actual law that for some reason allow you to transfer your funds why did you read the t&cs chances are that other the account is with a different bank and it always is fishy atleast for banks because of heightened money laundering regulations for people opening accounts and starting to transfer money to accounts with other banks after you have banked with them for certain time you can ask them to upgrade you to a current account which allow these services secondly because it might be a no frills account and they are n't allowed to charge fees they might disallow transfers to other banks and banks generally do n't charge fees for no frills accounts so certain services are disallowed which cost them money i have had a cash account for 4 5 years with barclays and i used to transfer money to other banks but i probably never tried transferring money just after opening an account

similar premise yes it 's an investment so you 're definitely hoping it grows so you can sell it for a profit gain public stock market vs. private shark tank are a little different though in terms of how much money you get and the form of income     with stocks if you buy x number of shares at a certain price you definitely want to sell them when they are worth more however you do n't get say 0.001 or whatever percentage you own it would be trivial of the profits they just pay a dividend to you based on a pre determined amount and multiply it by the number of shares you own and that would be your income unless you 're like warren buffet and berkshire who can buy significant stakes of companies through the stock market then they can likely put the investment on the balance sheet of his company but that 's a different discussion it would also be expensive as hell to do that     with shark tank investors the main benefit they get is significant ownership of a company for a cheap price however the risk can be greater too as these companies do n't have a strong foundation of sales and are just beginning investing in apple vs. a small business is pretty significant difference haha these companies are so small and in such a weak financial position which is why they 're seeking money to grow so they have almost no leverage mark cuban could swoop in and offer $ 50k for 25 and that 's almost worth it relative to what $ 50k in apple shares would get him it 's all about the return apple and other big public companies are mature and most of the growth has already happened so there is little upside with these startups if they ever take off then and you own 25 of the company it can be worth billions

no switzerland is one of the few countries the united states has agreements with not to confuse with tax treaties to work around this kind of thing you can find the list of the agreements here you can use the years you work in switzerland to make up for the remaining   credits you need to qualify for benefits in the u.s. when it 's time to retire you 'll receive a partial u.s. benefit that is proportional to the number of credits you earned in the u.s. you can learn more about all this here for other countries for which the us does n't have agreements in this scenario you would get no benefits back for the money so yes it would be lost

i ca n't give you a specific answer because i 'm not a tax accountant so you should seek advice from a tax professional with experience relevant to your situation this could be a complicated situation that being said one place you could start is the canada revenue agency 's statement on investment income which contains this paragraph interest foreign interest and dividend income foreign income    foreign non business income and certain other income are all amounts    you report on your return they are usually shown on the following    slips to avoid double taxation canada and the us almost certainly have a foreign tax treaty that ensures you are only taxed in your country of residence i 'm assuming you 're a resident of canada also this page states that if you received foreign interest or dividend income you have to    report it in canadian dollars use the bank of canada exchange rate    that was in effect on the day you received the income if you received    the income at different times during the year use the average annual    exchange rate you should consult a tax professional i 'm not a tax professional let alone one who specializes in the canadian tax system a professional is the only one you should trust to answer your question with 100 accuracy

plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for i disagree with as a current college student i would say to take out loans most of the time i am against loans though   so why there are very few times you will receive loans at 0 interest for 4 + years you have money saved currently but you do not know what the future entails if you expend all of your money on tuition and your car breaks down what do you do you can not used student loans to pay for your broken car student loans as long as they are subsidized serve as a wonderful risk buffer you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit with an additional caveat being to get a credit card in general debt loans credit cards are non beneficial but you have to establish debt to allow others to know that you can repay establishing this credit rating earlier than later is critical to cheaper interest rates on say a mortgage   you have made it through you have watched your expenses and you can pay your debt finish it if you do it right you will not have loans when you graduate you will have a stunning credit rating and you will have enjoyed college to its fullest potential remember you only really go through it once but this is contingent on   good luck   edit i did not realize the implication of this penalty which made me edit the line above to include to the extent you can per year for now student loan repayment is n't considered a qualified educational expense this means that if you withdraw from a 529 to pay your debts you may be subject to income taxes and penalties source furthermore   currently taxpayers who use 529 plan money for anything other than qualified education expenses are subject to a 10 federal tax penalty source my advice with this new knowledge save your 529 if you plan on continuing higher education at a more prestigious school if you do not use it later in your undergraduate years

here 's another example of such a practice and the problem it caused   my brother who lived alone was missing from work for several days so a co worker went to his home to search for him and called the local sheriff 's office for assistance   the local fire department which runs the ems ambulance was also in the event there was a medical emergency   they discovered my brother had passed away inside his home and had obviously been dead for days   as our family worked on probate matters to settle his estate following this death it was learned that the local fire department had levied a bill against my brother 's estate for $ 800 for responding with their ambulance to his home that day   i tried to talk to their commander about this insisting my brother had not called them nor had they transported him or even checked his pulse   the commander insisted theirs was common practice that someone was always billed for their medical response   he would not withdraw his bill for services   i hate to say but the family paid the bill in order to prevent delay of his probate issues and from receiving monies that paid for his final expenses

the time value of money is very important in understanding this issue   money today is worth more than money next year two years from now etc it 's a well understood economics concept and well worth reading about if you have some well time not only is money literally worth more now than later due to inflation but there is the simple fact that assuming you have money for the purpose of doing something being able to do that thing today is better than doing that same thing tomorrow   a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush gets to this rather directly having it now is better than probably having it later   would you rather have a nice meal tonight or eat beans and rice tonight and then have the same nice meal next year that 's why interest exists in part you 're offered some money now for more money later or in the case of buying a bond you 're offered more money later for some money now   the fact that people have different discount rates for money later is why the loan market can exist people with more money than they can use now have a lower discount for future money than people who really need money right now to buy a house to pay their rent whatever    so when choosing to buy a bond you look at the money you 're going to get both over the short term the coupon rate and the long term the face value and you consider whether $ 80 now is worth $ 100 in 20 years plus $ 2 per year   for some people it is for some people it is n't and that 's why the price is as it is $ 80   odds are if you have a few thousand usd you 're probably not going to be interested in this or if you have a very long term outlook there are better ways to make money over that long term   but if you 're a bank needing a secure investment that wo n't lose value or a trust that needs high stability you might be willing to take that deal

probably a bad assumption but i 'm assuming your in the united states keep in mind that the check number is printed in 2 places on the front of each check first in the upper right corner and also along the bottom edge on of the check since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed and you ca n't modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks so modifying the check numbers will not work your choices are basically to    the check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check the numbers are only for your convenience so processing checks with duplicate numbers wo n't matter   the check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements the only time the check number might be important is if you had to stop payment on a particular check or otherwise inquire about a particular check but this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks and start using the checks with duplicate numbers the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time you did n't mention how many checks you have with duplicate numbers or how frequently you actually write checks so that may play a part in your decision in my case 100 checks will last me literally years so it would n't be a problem for me

you definitely can not be guaranteed to get the bid or ask if you are selling more than are available desired at those prices what prices you do get depends on who is watching that contract and how willing they are to trade with you this question is not much different from the question of whether you can easily get into or out of a large position in an illiquid small stock easily   you can get out quickly if you are willing to take pennies on the dollar or you may get a reasonable price if you take a long time to get out of or into your position   you ca n't normally do both in general taking large positions in illiquid assets is not something people want to do without lining up a buyer seller beforehand   instead see if you can achieve your objective with liquid investments

congratulations on getting married   as far as the irs is concerned you are a married couple for all of this year for tax purposes the 2014 hsa contribution limit for you and your husband together is $   this limit applies to both of you together whether you file jointly or separately   so it looks like you and your husband have excess contributions this year   you 'll need to withdraw some contributions either in your account or your husband 's account to get under $ total for the year if you choose to take this money out of your account since you have already spent this money out of your hsa you wo n't actually receive a check from the withdrawal   instead the money that you have already spent will be from a normal hsa medical distribution to an excess contribution withdrawal   when you get your 1099-sa form from your hsa bank at tax time the distributions will be coded as excess contributions distributions   in addition the form will include the amount of any earnings interest that you received on your excess contributions at tax time you 'll need to examine your w-2 form from your employer closely   if the form does not include the amount that the employer hsa contribution in your taxable income you 'll need to add this amount as other income on your taxes   you 'll also need to include any earnings on the excess contributions reported on the 1099-sa since your husband funds his own hsa and does n't have any employer contributions to it you might find it easier to withdraw the excess contributions from his hsa instead of yours   to do this you need to tell his hsa bank that the withdrawal is an excess contribution withdrawal so that it gets reported correctly on his 1099-sa   there wo n't be any changes to his w-2 and the only other income he 'll need to report is any earnings on the excess contributions from his 1099-sa the instructions for form 8889 line 13 explain what to do in the event of an excess contribution note the text here is from the 2013 version of the instructions line 13 if you or someone on your behalf or your employer contributed more to your hsa than is allowable you may have to pay an additional tax on the excess contributions figure the excess contributions using the following instructions see form 5329 additional taxes on qualified plans including iras and other tax favored accounts to figure the additional tax excess contributions you make to figure your excess contributions including those made on your behalf subtract your deductible contributions line 13 from your actual contributions line 2 however you can withdraw some or all of your excess contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the note under excess employer contributions later you do not claim a deduction for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings excess employer contributions excess employer contributions are the excess if any of your employer 's contributions over your limitation on line 8 if you made a qualified hsa funding distribution line 10 during the tax year reduce your limitation line 8) by that distribution before you determine whether you have excess employer contributions if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return however you can withdraw some or all of the excess employer contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the following note you do not claim an exclusion from income for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings there are further instructions on what to do if you do n't take care of this until a future year but it is much better and easier if you take care of this before the end of this year and handle it correctly on your tax return i believe that this is how it will all work however you 'll want to confirm all of this with someone who knows what they are talking about and can look at your individual situation   hopefully this answer gives you enough information to be able to ask the right questions

the general concept is that your money will grow at an accelerating rate because you start getting interest paid on your returns in addition to the original investment   as a simple example assume you invest $ 100 and get 10 interest per year paid annually    the end of the first year you have your $ 100 + $ 10 interest for a total of $ 110 you start the second year with $ 110 and so 10 would be $ 11 for a total of $ 121 -the third year you start with $ 121 so 10 would be $ for a total of $ see how the amount it goes up each year increases if we were talking a higher initial amount or a larger number of years that can really add up that is essence is compound interest most of the complicated looking formulas you see out there for compound interest are just shortcuts so you do n't have to go through the above exercise a bunch of times to find out how much you would have after some number of years this formula tells you how much you would after a certain number of   at a given interest assuming they pay interest n times per year for example you would use 12 for n if it paid interest monthly instead of yearly p represents the   amount you started out with    if you keep investing monthly as shown in your example instead of just depositing it and letting it sit you have to use a more complicated formula finance people refer to this as calculating the future value of an annuity   that formula looks like this a = pmt 1 + 1 r x   a is the amount you would have at the end of the time period    n the number of compounding periods months if you get interest calculated monthly    pmt the total amount you are putting in each period n     r just like before the interest rate you are getting paid be sure to adjust this to a monthly number if n represents months divide apr by 12 most interest rates are quoted as apr which is the annualized interest rate not counting compounding do n't confuse this with apy which has compounding built into it and is not appropriate for use in this formula inserting your example r monthly interest rate = 15 apr 12 = n = 30 years 12 months year = 360 months    a = $ 150 x 1 + 1 x a = $ rounded

the real estate industry today is highly exploitative you 're right but there are currently nothing stopping rents from rising the major controls in place are are primarily supply constraints which would lower prices if removed by allowing small entrepreneurial developers and builders to create new housing more easily there 's also nothing to stop institutional investors from buying up all the housing right now but those investors are generally not looking for high growth they 're looking for stable returns apartment buildings are viewed as similar to blue chip stock portfolios in that regard low growth but also low risk   the reason capitalism would n't lead to monopoly is that it takes work both to gain resources and to retain them and the most reliable way to retain them is to reinvest them in the economy investment permits new businesses to grow and new industries to form it 's precisely because the economy is n't limited to a fixed size that wealth of one group does n't require to poverty of others new value creation is the core of the theory and nearly every living person has at least some capital their body and mind to begin employing toward value creation   i recommend reading henry 's economics in one lesson if you 'd like to understand the theory behind why and how free market capitalism is supposed to work

to be fair i do n't necessarily think that our guy was actively trying to screw us over in retrospect i 've known a few people like him people with major control issues who get extremely anxious and when something is n't in their hands and who kind of develop this authoritarian mindset because they do n't trust the group as a whole that leads to a lot of paranoia and projection i think he kind of developed a sort of oh no i think he 's gon na kill me well i 'll kill him first mentality and that affected his thinking   every complaint he brought up privately with our president was something he was actually the one bringing to the table they think i 'm power hungry actually we did n't but thank god we found out that he actually was before it was too late they do n't trust me as the executive to make the decisions he seemed to be the strongest and guiding voice in the meetings but apparently was n't actually or expressing any of his actual plans because he did n't trust us to know them they 're gon na cut and run and we 'll be left to keep things together he set of a chain of events which led to us having to to get everything out of his name in order to keep our original timetable after this all went down it came to light how absurdly and specific his fears were down to my wife for being controlling or something because i wanted to discuss my portion of the buy in with her before i paid it when he 'd never even met her   anyway i 've had actual adult bosses like this and they invariably find ways of bringing people down over little personal disagreements regardless of how well they 're performing the paranoia and ego driving things for that personality type can be hard to see at first because they 're invariably charismatic and on message and capable of really looking like they 're taking the whole of the picture into account before making reasoned suggestions and you need somebody with these skills for top leadership positions i do have a measure of pity for these people as they seem to live in a state of really subtle but profound internal dissonance that nobody else really gets a look at   the main problem here is that it 's easy to conflate image with substance as you have to have a fair amount of knowledge about the topic being discussed to parse their behavior and especially once a large power structure around the guy the of can really build which makes it tough to distinguish between a well reasoned interpretation of reality and a specious one well our last meeting with the new structure was great and we 're more excited than ever about getting started with less baggage

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor to answer the question directly not much short of investing in something at the exact moment before it goes bananas then reinvesting into a bigger stock and bigger etc it 's super high risk a better way is to sacrifice some small things less coffee less smokes less going out partying so that instead of having $ 100 you have $ 100 a week this puts you into a situation where you can save enough to become a deposit on an appreciating asset choose your own asset class property in au for me take out a loan for as much as you can for your $ 100 a week payment and make it interest only with an offset against it distributions from shares can either be reinvested or put into the offset or in the case of property rent can be put against the offset pretty soon you end up with a scenario where you have cash offsetting a loan down to nothing but you still have access to the cash invest into another place and your asset you can take out any equity that has grown and put that also into your offset keep pulling equity and using the money from the offset as deposits on other assets it kind of works really well on property and within 15 years you can build an empire with a passive income to retire on the biggest thing the rich guys get that the poor guys do n't is that debt is good use someone else 's money to buy an appreciating asset then when you pay it back eventually you own the growth use debt to buy more debt for exponential growth of course you need to also invest your time to research what you are investing in you need to know when you make the decision to buy that it will appreciate it 's no good just buying off a tip you may as well drop your money on the horses if you want to play it like that fortunately one thing we all have in common regardless of our money is time we have time which we can invest

i very much agree with what eh bacon said about townhouses but wanted to add a bit about hoa 's renting after moving on and appreciation hoa 's hoa 's can be restrictive but they can also help protect property values not all hoa 's are created equal some mean you have zero exterior maintenance some do n't you 'll be able to review the hoa financials to see where the money goes and if they have healthy reserves you 'll see how much they spend on administration i think ~10 is typical and administration can be offset by the savings associated with doing everything in bulk a well run hoa should actually save you money over paying for all the things separately but many people are happy to do some things themselves rather than pay for it and would come out ahead if they did n't have an hoa and of course not all hoa 's are well run just do your best to get informed transitioning to rental if you are interested in trying your hand being a landlord after living there for a while a townhouse typically exposes you to less rental risk than a single family home because the cost is typically lower and if the hoa maintains everything outside the house then you do n't have to worry as much about tenants keeping a lawn in good shape for example appreciation appreciation varies wildly by market some research by suggests in general condo 's have outperformed single family houses over the last 5 years by 10.5 the same article notes that others disagree with 's assessment and put condo 's below single family houses by 1.3 annually my first townhouse has appreciated 41 over the last 3 years while houses in the area are closer to 30 over the same period but i believe that 's a function of my local market more than a nationwide trend i would n't plan around any appreciation forecasts source condos may be appreciating faster than single family houses my have to do your research on each potential property regardless of whether it 's a condo townhouse single family to find out what restrictions there are and what services are provided by the hoa if any your agent should be provided with most of the pertinent info and you may not get to see hoa financials until you 're under contract most importantly in my view i would n't buy anywhere near the top of your budget being house poor is no fun and will limit your options do n't count on appreciation or better income in the future to justify stretching yourself thin in the short term

started to post this as a comment but i think it 's actually a legitimate answer running a rental property is neither speculation nor investment but a business just as if you were renting cars or tools or anything else that puts it in an entirely different category the property may gain or lose value but you do n't know which or how much until you 're ready to terminate the business so like your own house it really is n't a liquid asset it 's closer to being inventory meanwhile like inventory you need to it on a fairly regular basis by maintaining it finding tenants and so on and how much it returns depends strongly on how much effort you put into it in terms of selecting the right location and product in the first place and in how you market yourself against all the other businesses offering near equivalent product and how you differentiate the product and so on   i think approaching it from that angle deciding whether you really want to be a business owner or keep all your money in more abstract investments then deciding what businesses are interesting to you and running the numbers to see what they 're likely to return as income then making up your mind whether real estate is the winner from that group is likely to produce better decisions among other things it helps you remember to focus on all the costs of the business when doing the math do n't forget that income from the business is taxed at income rates not investment rates and do n't forget that you 're making a bet on the future of that neighborhood as well as the future of that house changes in demographics or housing stock or business climate could all affect what rents you can charge as well as the value of the property and not necessarily in the same direction it may absolutely be the right place to put some of your money it may not explore all the possible outcomes before making the bet and decide whether you 're willing to do the work needed to influence which ones are more likely

well the idea of good practice is subjective so obviously there wo n't be an objectively correct answer i suspect that whatever article you read was making this recommendation as a budgeting tool to physically isolate your reserve of cash from your spending account(s as a means to keep spending in check this is a common idea that i 've heard often enough though i do n't think i am alone in believing that it 's unnecessary except in the case of a spender who can not be trusted to stay within a budget   i suppose there is a very small argument to be made about security where if you use a bank account for daily spending and that account is somehow compromised the short term damage is limited in the end i would argue that if you 're in control of spending and budgeting have a single source of income that is from regular employment and you use a credit card for most of your daily spending there 's no compelling reason to have more than one bank account   some people have a checking and savings account simply for the psychological effect of separating their money some couples have 3 4 accounts for income personal spending and savings other people have separate accounts for business self employment funds and a few people like having many accounts that act as hard limits for spending in different categories of course the other submitted answer is correct in noting that the more accounts that you have the more you are opening yourself up to accounting issues if funds do n't transfer the way you expect them to assuming you 're the accounts often some banks are more lenient with this however and may offer you the option to freely overdraft by pulling funding from another pre designated account that you also hold at the same bank

i am going to like i said i have not traded options much in general but i can see a lot of potential in derivatives in general and it makes me kind of grin in the case of commodities the advantages are really apparent the only problem i see with stock options is that they expire and thus if you are more long term bull on a stock it would be harder but for things like commodities that are shorter term any ways and require margin it makes a lot of sense imo i could see how you could gain a larger diversification through options being able to bet on russell 2000 s&amp;p etc or esoteric markets electricity    i will look up that book that you mentioned thanks man

i would think it extremely unlikely that an issuer would cancel your card for having an of approximately zero the issuer charges the vendor that accepts a card a percentage of the transaction usually up to ~3 amex is generally higher so they are making money even if you carry no balance on your card the specific language for various vendor side credit card agreements boils down to we are essentially giving you the vendor a short term loan and you will pay us for it this why you see credit card minimum purchase amounts at places like hot dog stands they 're getting nailed on the percentage   this is also why when given the choice between debit or credit for a particular card i choose where to put the hit on the company i like less the retailer or the bank

as much as you would like to believe in american i am afraid it is has come to an end the jews you love so much have taken over your government and sucked it dry all you have is debt between your treasury and your jewish fed they will tax what little you have left and then eventually history will replay its self in its inevitable cycle   what does america export beside financial and weapons little else that is not made cheaper and better every where else and that s why you have a trade deficit you ca n't even build a decent fucking car anymore   your youth is no longer educated and your nation is now perpetually so stoned they do n't have a fucking clue what is happening around them   you are involved in wars you can not win paying with money you do not have trying to destabilize the middle east and muslim countries because the very same jews that have infested you political and economic system   want to annex more land   you have no moral religious social or ethical structure left in fact you no longer know whether your children should grow up as men or women or neither or either   every world leader is laughing at you and openly making fun of you and now that you are exposed as supporters of isis and and whatever you want to call them are leaving you and your alliances   your government is openly corrupt and takes bribes from lobbyists and in the end the biggest fucking moron that your country could produce has been installed as your president regardless of who you voted for or wanted   your president has only one fucking skill declaring bankruptcy and that is why he was chosen to first insulate the global economy from your fed driven soon to be hyper inflated dollar and then bring the straight down in another controlled demolition   you think you are coming out of this   that is wishful thinking

tl;dr summary 0 balance transfer offers and free checks usable anywhere    rarely are a good deal for the customer 0 rate balance transfer offers and the checks usable anywhere including payment of taxes come with a transaction fee because the credit card company is paying off the balance on the other card or the tax or the electric bill in the full amount of $ x as stated on the other card statement or on the tax electric bill this is in contrast to a purchase transaction where if you buy something for $ x you pay the card company $ x but the card company pays the merchant something less than $ of course the merchant has jacked up the sale price of the item to pass on the charge to you can you get the credit card company to waive the transaction fee you can try asking them but it is unlikely that you will succeed if your credit score is good i have seen balance transfer offers with no transaction fees made to people who have do n't have good credit scores and are used to carrying a balance   on their credit cards i assume that the company making the offer knows that it will make up the transaction fee from future interest payments a few other points to keep in mind with respect to using a 0 balance transfer offer to pay off a student loan or anything else for that matter

you sound like you 're well educated well spoken and so i 'm going to assume that you are somewhere in the neighborhood of top 5 material that means you can pretty much do anything you want to if you put enough effort into it there are two types of people in this world those who run the world and those who live comfortably in it and of course everyone else but they are irrelevant to the discussion who do you want to be i 've been around a lot of wildly successful people and they have two consistent traits   connections and freedom first everyone always told me that it 's not what you know it 's who you know but i never appreciated it until after college the world runs on connections   the more connections you have and the more successful they are the more successful you will be second the more freedom you have the more opportunity you will have to take chances which is how you become wildly successful freedom comes from not being in debt first and having money second why do you think harvard grads are the guys that end up having so much money and power it 's probably because they grew up in a rich family which provided them money freedom and a wide social circle of rich people connections so you 're not rich   what to do well the easiest way to get into that group is to go to college with them and that means you need to get into harvard or another ivy league stanford if you want to be an engineer college will be where you will make your most intense and long lasting friendships   that roommate at harvard that you went on the crazy four day road trip with may someday be ceo of a company and when he needs a cio you can be damn sure you 'll be at the top of the list if you 're qualified but harvard costs a lot of money which means you 'll be in debt a lot when you get out of college you 'll have lots of rich important but you 'll be deeply in debt no freedom most of these type of people end up becoming consultants at big firms because they pay well    you 'll live a comfortable life and pay off your student loans in five or 10 years    then you 'll continue to live comfortably   but at that point you 'll be too old to take huge chances and too comfortable to change things or perhaps you 'll have a big mortgage =   no freedom with a heavy debt load it 's almost impossible to say join an early stage startup and really be able to take huge chances   you can do it maybe   or as an alternate option you can do what i did go to a cheap state school and graduate with no debt that puts you on the other side of the fence   freedom but no connections   then in order to be successful you have to figure out how to get connections goldman sachs wo n't hire you and everyone you meet is going to automatically assume you 're mediocre because of where you went to college at this point your only option is to take big chances move to new york or san francisco offer to work for free as an intern somewhere or something   it can be done and it 's really not too hard you just have to have lots of spending restraint because the little money you have has to go a long way so what are the other options well some people are recommending that you think about not going to college at all that will certainly save you money and give you a four year head start on whatever you decide to do freedom but you 'll forever be branded as that guy without a college degree   think my second option above but just two or three times worse    you wo n't even get that free internship and you 'll be that weird guy at dinner parties who answer the first question so where did you go to college   it does n't matter if you 're self taught   life is n't a meritocracy   if you 're very good you 'll end up getting a nice cushy job pushing ones and zeros a nice cushy golden job well you could go to community college they 're certainly cheap you can spend very little money so you 'll end up with fairly good freedom    i might add though that community colleges teach trades and not high level things like management and complex architecture    you 'll be behind technically but not as bad as if you did n't go at all how about connections your fellow students will probably lack ambition money and connections they 'll be candidates for entry level wage slave jobs at fortune 500 companies after they graduate if they get lucky they 'll work up to middle management there 's no alumni association and there 's certainly no club in downtown boston at new york and silicon valley dinner parties having a community college degree is almost as bad as having nothing at all   indeed the entire value of the community college degree will be what you learn and you 'll be learning at the speed and level of your classmates my advice if you get into an ivy league school go and hope you get some grants to help you out the debt will suck but you 'll be well positioned for the future otherwise go to a cheap second tier school where you can get a large scholarship there are also lots of third party scholarships that are out there on the internet you can get i got a couple from local organizations do n't work during college focus on expanding your network instead the future value of a minimum wage job while you 're trying to go through school is practically zero

considering that it 's common for the monthly mortgage payment to be 25 of one 's income it 's an obvious advantage for that monthly burden to be eliminated   the issue as i see it is that this is the last thing one should do in the list of priorities the idea of no mortgage is great but you might pay early and have just a few years of payments left on the mortgage and if you are unemployed those payments are still due it 's why i 'd suggest loading up retirement accounts and other savings before paying the mortgage sooner your point that rates are low and your expected return is higher is well presented i feel no compulsion to prepay my 3.5 mortgage   as the op is in canada land of no mortgage interest deduction i ignore that till now the deduction simply reduces the effective rate based on the country tax code permitting it it 's not the reason to have a loan but it 's ignorant to ignore the math

you ca n't run a business without making $ $ $    good will and good intentions only go so far and they do not always equate to positive results capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results fail and eventually go out of business these are facts which govern how capitalism works i.e. success is rewarded failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy    so if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time increased perks etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees    however if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under cut them in the market place nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive is unreasonable and flat out childish

everyone is usually better off without insurance   a very few people are much better off with insurance   insurance is a gamble and when you lose you win   very few people lose badly enough to win   most people just pay money into insurance and never get as much back as they pay in   for most people in most lives insurance is a bad deal   the reason people crave insurance is because they can not calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an actuary can do so   the gap in knowledge between you and and actuary is what make insurance providers rich and you poor   they are smart you are not   you think some terrible thing is going to happen to you they know it probably wo n't   so they sell you a product you probably will never need   anyhow most people ca n't understand probability and how to analyze risk so they wo n't get what i 'm saying here understanding the real cost of risk is the first lesson in understanding money and wealth   rich people usually understand the value and cost of risk   hence they only buy insurance when they expect to lose that is to win   we rich people do everything only when we know already we are going to win   we do n't gamble unless we are the house   when a self made rich man buys something its because he knows already he is going to come out ahead on it most probably

while that 's possible there is no guarantee   the ultimate thing causing the scare was a loss of jobs due to outsourcing   i know we associate it with the housing bubble   but really we moved to housing from dot com and we moved to dot com from real manufacturing and production   these more recent bubbles were ways of making up for the lost of manufacturing jobs   manufacturing jobs left i 'm going to focus on the us the us because it was cheaper in other countries   now once debt is largely payed off people will likely be willing to accept lower pay making production in the us cheaper   however we still have environmental regulations and basic labor laws further initial education to enter the job market brings about massive debt as well   this is pure speculation but what i think will happen is collapse of the education bubble   people will lose faith in college degrees and start working as contractors plumbers mechanics etc   this will generate a direct wealth but it will also severely hurt our ability to innovate due to the resulting brain drain   multiple educational facilities will close down or contract and some private schools will convert to public to stay afloat   many jobs will also be lost     the resulting outflow of will stimulate the development of new start ups in online education and smaller institutes   this will lead to cheaper education with more certifications over degrees   this will also lead to more start ups in direct production of goods     i 'm thinking this process will take another 5 7 years or so   again this is just wild ass guessing on my side based on observed trends

is this amount an adequate starting amount to begin investing with yes you can open an account at a brokerage with this amount i 'm not sure i would invest in individual stocks at this point which services should i use to start buying shares currently my bank offers this service but i 'm willing to use other sources i ca n't make uk specific recommendations but i 'd compare your bank 's fees to those of a discount broker as well as the variety and level of service available i would like to regularly increase the amount invested in shares is it worth doing this in say £ 200 increments take a look at the fees associated with each investment divide the fee by the increment to see what percent you 'll lose to fees commissions keep in mind that you have to gain more than that percentage to start earning a positive return on your investment if you have access to fee free automatic mutual fund investments and you can commit to the £ 200 amount on a regular basis going forward then this can be a completely free way of making these incremental investments see also this answer on dollar cost averaging and my comment on the other answer on that question for how fees impact returns when buying shares should i focus on say two or three companies or diversify more i would diversify into two or three different index funds read up on asset allocation for example you might invest 1/3 of your balance into s&p 500 index fund bond index fund and msci eafe index fund but that 's just a rough example and not necessarily good for you i highly recommend the intelligent asset allocator by william bernstein for excellent info on diversification and asset allocation

this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses the bold part is where you lose me this absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance   it just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute   nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50 of the gross proceeds of your $ 10,000 or whatever nominal amount of money you 're dealing with investment and return it all to you after a year   and no money manager will insure that the market wo n't decline hedge funds pe firms vc firms investment partnerships etc all basically run the way you 're describing again without your loss insurance   everyone 's money is pooled and investments are made   everyone shares the and everyone shares the losses   and to top it off the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund   all of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree because returns are calculated on net proceeds with enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund for the rest of us there are etfs and other extremely fee reasonable investment options   and if you do n't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you 're kidding yourself your first bullet point i 'll add that aside from skewing the manager 's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns i doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1 expense ratio on an etf   if you look at the s&p performance for 10 or 20 or however many years i 'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back   the bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains

institutions may be buying large quantities of the stock and would want the price to go up after they are done buying all that they have to buy   if the price jumps before they finish buying then they may not make as great a deal as they would otherwise   consider buying tens of thousands of shares of a company and then how does one promote that   also what kind of pr system should those investment companies have to disclose whether or not they have holdings in these companies   this is just some of the stuff you may be missing here the wall street analysts are the investment banks that want the companies to do business through them and thus it is a win win relationship as the bank gets some fees for all the transactions done for the company while the company gets another to try to play up the stock

i was active in prosper when it started up it was very easy to get attracted to the high risk loans with big interest rates and i lost about 14 after all my loans ran their course there 's 10 still active but it wo n't change the figure by much prosper has wider standards than lending club so more borrowers with worse credit scores could ask for loans lenders could also set interest rates far lower so they could end up having loans with rates lower than the risk implied   this was set up with the idea of a free market where anyone could ask to borrow and anyone could loan money at whatever interest rate they wanted   it turns out a lot of lenders were not as smart as they thought they were aside it 's funny how people will for a free market but when they lose money will suddenly be against the free market they said they wanted this seems to apply to both individual p2p lenders up to massive multinational banks   since then prosper has tightened their standards on who can borrow and the interest rates are now fixed so i expect going forward it will be less easy to lose a bunch of money   the key is that one bad loan will erase the return of many good ones so it 's best to examine the loans carefully and stick with the high quality   simplified example if you have 10 1 yr loans of $ 100 each paying 10 interest year you get 10 return at the end of the year so $ 100 10 of $ 1000 but if one loan goes bad at the start you have lost money so a 90 success rate in picking borrowers leads to a loss you want to diversity over quite a few loans and you want to fund quality loans   i think really enjoyed investing through prosper because it gave me an insight into lending and loss ratios that i had not had before it also caused me to look at the banks with even more when the case of the no doc loans and am loans came to light

i opened several free checking accounts at a local credit union   one is a deposit account where all of my new money goes   i get paid every two weeks   every other sunday we have our money day where we allocate the money from our deposit account into our other checking accounts   i have one designated as a bills account where all of my bills get paid automatically via bill pay or auto pay i created a spreadsheet that calculates how much to save each money day for all of my upcoming bills   this makes it so the amount i save for my bills is essentially equal   then i allocate the rest of my deposit money into my other checking accounts   i have a grocery household and main checking accounts but you could use any combination that you want when we 're at the store we check our balances how much we have left to spend on our mobile app   we ca n't overspend this way   the key is to make sure you 're using your pin when you use your debit card   this way it shows up in real time with your credit union and you 've got an accurate balance   this has worked really well to coordinate spending between me and my wife   it sounds like it 's a lot of work but it 's actually really automated   the best part is that i do n't have to do any accounting which means my budget does n't fail if i 'm not entering my transactions or categorizing them i 'm happy to share my spreadsheet if you 'd like

paying yourself first is a method to ensure you are meeting your financial goals whatever they may be it 's also an easy way to automate the process of sending money where you need it go without needing to think about it your goals could be to buy a bit of a mutual fund every month max your ira or stash a percentage of each paycheck in a wedding savings account maybe you are saving for a house knowing you should save and not doing is guilt generating paying yourself first means regularly putting money to these goals so you can stop worrying any way you figure it you 've still got bills to pay   paying yourself first means taking care of these payments right off the top of your paycheck the money goes where you need it a good move is to automate this with bill pays ach transfers to investments accounts etc once this is done you can spend the money that is left over knowing that you 've taken care of the important things and met all your goals you never have to find yourself wondering if you paid your cell phone bill or if you have enough money to go out tonight savings for the new car you want are as they say in the bank

the buying service your credit union uses is similar to the one my credit union uses i have used their service several times there is no direct cost to use the service though the credit union as a whole might have a fee to join the service i have used it 4 times over the decades if you know what make and model you want to purchase or at least have it narrowed down to just a few choices you can get an exact price for that make model and options you do this before negotiating a price you are then issued a certificate you have to go to a specific salesman at a specific dealership but near a large city there will be several dealers to pick from   there is no negotiating at the dealership you still have to deal with a trade in and the financing option dealer credit union or cash but it is nice to not have to negotiate on the price of course there is nobody to stop you from using the price from the buying service as a goal when visiting a more conveniently located dealership that is what i did last time the first couple of times i used the standard credit union financing and the last time i did n't need a loan even if you do n't use the buying service one way to pay for the car is to get the loan from the credit union but get the rebate from the dealer many times if you get the low dealer financing you ca n't get the rebate doing it this way actually saves money speaking of rebates see how the buying service addresses them the big national rebates   were still honored during at least one of my purchases so it turned out to be the buying service price minus $ 1,000 if your service worked like my experience the cost to you was a little time to get the price and a little time in a different dealer to verify that the price was good

# 155379
i tend to agree with rocky 's answer   however it sounds like you want to look at this from the numbers side of things   so let 's consider some numbers i 'm assuming you have the money to buy the new car available as cash in hand and that if you do n't buy the car you 'll invest it reasonably   so if you buy the new car today you 're $ 17 k out of pocket   let 's look at some scenarios and compare   assuming if you buy the new car today then after 1 year you 'll have if you keep the old car after 1 year you get after 2 years you have and after 3 years you 're at or in other words nothing depletes the value of your assets faster than buying the new car after 1 year you 've essentially lost $ 5 k to depreciation     however over the short term the immediate cost of the tires combined with the continued depreciation of the old car do reduce your purchasing power somewhat you wo n't be able to muster $ 25 k towards a new car without chipping in a bit of extra cash and inflation will tend to drive the cost of the new car up as time goes on   so the relative gap between the value of your assets and the cost of the new car tends to increase though it stays well below the $ 5k that you lose to depreciation if you buy the new car immediately   which is something that you could potentially spin to support whichever side you prefer i suppose though note that i 've made some fairly pessimistic assumptions   in particular the current u.s. inflation rate is under 1 and a new car may depreciate by as much as 25 in the first year while older cars may depreciate by less than the 8 assumed   and i selected the cheapest new car price cited and did n't credit the tires with adding any value to your old car   each of those aspects tends to make continuing to drive the older car a better option than buying the new one

if you sell a stock you do n't own it 's called a short sale you borrowed the shares from an owner of the stock and eventually would buy to close on most normal shares you can hold a short position indefinitely but there are some shares that have a combination of either a small float or too high a short position that shares to short are not available   this can create a short squeeze where shorts are burned by being forced to buy the stock back   last when you did this you should have instructed the broker that you were selling to open or selling short in the old days when people held stock certificates you were required to send the certificate in when you sold today the broker should know that was n't your intention

so is knowledge of products simply not considered material nonpublic information well material is relative but it certainly is nonpublic information   and trading based on that information would likely be considered illegal if it is actually material    many companies require that employees with material non public info get stock trades approved by their legal department   this protects not only the employee but the employer from sec scrutiny   if the legal department determines that the employee has non public info that is the of the stock trade they might deny the request in many cases these employees receive stock through espp iso and/or rsus and often sell while in possession of information about products just receiving stock as part of as part of a compensation program would not be illegal provided it was part of a normal compensation package and not deliberately awarded in advance of these types of events selling or outright buying stock including rsus with that kind of information would certainly be scrutinized   an employee is granted rsus they vest 7 months before announcement of a new product the employee knows the exact specifications of the product if they sell the vested stock before the announcement would this constitute insider trading or not why the law is not meant to prevent people from investing in their own company just because they know future plans   so knowledge of an announcement 7 months out may not be considered material   if however you sold stock the day or a week before some announcement that caused the stock to fall then that would probably be scrutinized   or if you traded shortly before an announcement of a new revolutionary product that was set to be released in seven months and the stock rose then you might be scrutinized so there is a lot of gray area but remember that the spirit of the law is to prevent people from benefiting unfairly with non public information   it would be hard to prove that gaining on a stock trade 7 months before a product announcement would be considered unfair gain   a lot can happen in that time

i 'm going to put this very very simply   the banking system does create money through leveraging and the money multiplier this is absolutely true   the current theory is that this is how the economy is expanded because of the basic premise that an economy can only grow with ample amounts of land labor and capital and it is assumed that the money multiplier allows the development and purchase of all of these things that have the net effect of growing the economy beyond the level of debt built up as part of the process of wealth creation   i have no problem with the above in principle the problem comes when the cycle of debt is built up recklessly and irresponsibly with little if any regulation   that leads to a system in which debt and interest buildup faster than wealth is created   i also have issues with who ends up holding a piece of the pie as it is called but that 's a separate issue entirely   the fed 's job is to stop the economy from collapsing overnight due to fluctuations in the price of money   it would be no different if money was backed by gold and in fact part of the reason why we abandoned that notion as laid out at bretton woods was because of how gold was being sold as a commodity thus affecting the price of money the way speculation on fiat currency occurred due in part to charles de being an asshole   in today 's world where arbitrage happens almost instantaneously and markets shift rapidly there is danger in not having a central bank that can regulate the price of currency to prevent disastrous inflation or economy unemployment   every nation in the world has one because they are necessary in the context of the current economy   banking regulation is a multi tiered problem that involves regulatory capture congressional payoffs a closed circle in terms of who is qualified to even run such institutions and numerous other problems but this is not unique to the banking industry every regulatory body in existence suffers from the same problem   at the moment the chairman of the fed is an appointed position that exists so that key economic decisions will be isolated from the political pressure that elections result in avoiding hastily thrown together and shoddy economic policy based solely upon politics   the independence of like greenspan is questionable but in theory it 's supposed to prevent decision making   in short what i just explained is what everyone else here already knows   welcome to the party

it just had less cash that does n't necessarily mean that the company had a net loss for the year just like having more cash does n't mean the company made a profit    what if a company had revenue of $ 1 million expenses of $ 2 million and took out a loan of $ 5 million they had a net loss of $ 1 million but they have $ 4 million more in cash

simply put the government has no balls to fight corruption   ideally the government would have enough people to oversee and make sure corruption like this does n't happen but the politicians cut a lot of money out for this type of enforcement primarily because they had money donated to them by these same businesses this looks great for the politician as it looks like they 're cutting government fat let 's say something like a hundred million dollars these fleece these companies and when they go under they plead and beg the government to bail them out or else they 'll have to fire all these people and it 'll kill the economy so the government steps in and bails out these companies for a few billion now they look like they are being proactive and saving the economy   all at the expense of you of course it 's too bad politicians do n't do what they believe is best but do what their donors believe is best for themselves

the goal of the single fund with a retirement date is that they do the rebalancing for you    they have some set of magic ratios specific to each fund that go something like this note i completely made up those numbers and asset mix when you invest in the mutual fund super account 2025 fund you get the benefit that in 2015 10 years until retirement they automatically change your asset mix and when you hit 2025 they do it again    you can replace the functionality by being on top of your rebalancing that being said i do n't think you need to exactly match the fund choices they provide just research asset allocation strategies and remember to adjust them as you get closer to retirement

the following are my opinion based upon research analysis since this involves taxation rules suggest you consult a tax attorney for their views   a. yes you can transfer any any amount of dollars to your nre account without paying any additional taxes   b. since you have passed substantial presence test you will be categorized resident alien you need to disclose the interest earned on your nre account this amount will be with your total income in us you would have to add this interest income in your total income and calculate tax c. transferring money to parents answer is yes you need to elaborate on this further advantage of parking money in nre account is that you can repatriate money in dollars any time you want assuming you need to buy a house or further education this would be useful incase you do n't have any of those goals yes you can transfer money to your parent if they are in need of funds   d. any transfer above $ 14000 will attract gift taxes this $ 14000 is the overall limit for a tax payee incase you transfer $ 14000 for each parent then it comes to $ there are chances that irs may raise a that you are circumventing the limit by splitting the recipients   e. only when you transfer more than $ 14000 you need to report and pay the gift tax

think carefully about the added expenses   it may still make sense but it probably wo n't be as cheap as you are thinking   in addition to the mortgage and property taxes there is also insurance and building maintenance and repairs appliances carpets and roofs need to be replaced periodically   depending on the area of the country there is lawn maintenance and now removal you need to make sure you can cover the expenses if you are without a tenant for 6 months or longer   when tenants change there is usually some cleaning and painting that needs to be done you can deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes on your part of the building   you need to claim any rent as income but can deduct the other part of the mortgage interest and taxes as an expense   you can also deduct building maintenance and repairs on the rental portion of the building   some improvements need to be depreciated over time 5 27 years   you also need to depreciate the cost of the rental portion of the building   this basically means that you get a deduction each year but lower the cost basis of the building so you owe more capital gains taxes when you sell if you do this i would get a professional to do your taxes at least the first year   its not hard once you see it done but there are a lot of details and complications that you want to get right

bonds are priced very high because their price is compared to their yields with the current interest rates which are very low the bond yields will be low however bond issuers still need the money so there still will be high par value and investors will not sell bonds at a loss unless there 's a better investment = bonds with better yields once the rates start going up you 'll see bonds with current rates dropping in value significantly once alternatives appear people holding them will start dumping them to move the money somewhere more profitable similarly the stocks since there 's no other investment alternatives yields on the bonds are low interests are low people invest more in the stocks once the rates go up the investors will start rebalancing portfolios and cashing out

see anyone who is n't heavy finance which truthfully is a good 80 of the business will be fine with the transition my issue is how to support the remaining 20 of advanced excel users to attempt to find other hopefully better ways to view and change the same data we 've had these talks several times over with the technology transformation team and the main takeaway is   most users misuse excel as a work around tool to address messy data reports so for these processes they want us to determine if the data could come out clean and could run the desired analytics on the data straight out of the source then would there be a need for excel   for some models like monte carlo etc i believe those ones are going to have exceptions but do you think it is understandable and feasible to attempt to remove all the of excel and instead work towards a better way to accomplish the same goal because i do find that a good amount of spreadsheet work is sometimes just cleaning up the report data output before the real excel magic happens

we considered similar big renovations when putting our house on the market the answer turns out to be pretty simple unless you do renovation type work as your day job or have really good friends in the residential contracting business sell as is you will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen con to renovate any space in your home you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it if you 're trying to turn a profit with the renovation like house flippers do professionally you look for easy repairs buy good looking but inexpensive materials and do the labor yourself whether you sell to the market or to a specifically interested buyer is your call but i will caution you that a specifically interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal or a steal   when marketing our house we met with three different realtors the first one was very about what we could list for basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back she also had a to do list a mile long and my wife and i both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around even as she us that selling it would be no trouble we eventually realized why she was so apprehensive and fired her before we got even halfway through her to dos which included major landscaping new kitchen floors and etc which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target the second one took a look at our half finished and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures saying we were putting on a pig she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally for about 80 of the list price our first realtor quoted and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all during the tour she pointed out problems with the house that were n't even there like foundation issues such as sloping floors in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy we that out pretty quickly showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back this by the way is the kind of thing you want to avoid unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major it should have decent value on the market and you should n't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap just like our third choice was just right he saw all the same comparables our house and recommended that we offer about $ 20k less than the fully upgraded version but still about $ 20k more than the second realtor was estimating targeting a real buyer and not an investor or flipper but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable we finished the paint and finish projects we started brought in a weekend 's worth of scheduled and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days giving us the extra $ 20k worth of down payment to put into our new house in summary i highly recommend a realtor because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house however make sure you find the right one realtors are ultimately in business for themselves and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one that is what gets them paid some of them will do it the right way working the deal with other realtors and their prospective buyers to get you what you need others will take the easy way out at your expense either giving you bad advice about how to present and price your home so that you end up on the market for 6 months with no offers or handing your house to their business buddies at a discount

common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns   i guess its more like very few investor can beat the market a vast majority can not do not what evidence exists for or against this obviously we can have a comparison of all investors if we start taking a look at some of the actively managed funds given that fund managers are experts compared to common individual investors if we compare this we can potentially extend it more generically to others most funds beat the markets for few years as you keep increasing the timeline i.e. try seeing 10 year 15 year 20 year return this is easy the data is available you would realize that no fund consistently beat the index few years quite good few years quite bad on average most funds were below market returns especially if one compares on longer terms or 10 20 years hence the perception of course we all know warren buffet has beat the market by leaps and bounds after the initial success people like warren buffet develop the power of self fulfilling prophecy there would be many other individuals

the answers you 've received already are very good i truly sympathize with your situation in general it makes sense to try to build off of existing relationships here are a few ideas i do n't know if you work for a small or large company or local state government but if there is any kind of retirement planning through your workplace make sure to investigate that those people are usually already paid something for their services by your employer so they should have less of an interest in making money off you directly one more thought a no fee brokerage company e.g. charles schwab they offer a free one hour phone call with an investment adviser if you invest at least $ 25k. i personally had very good experiences with them this answer may be too anecdotal and not specifically address the annuity dilemma you mentioned that dilemma is why you need to find someone you can trust who is competent see the credentials for financial advisers mentioned in the other answers and will work the numbers out with you

what this means is this the authors of the website claim they have calculated the cost that it will take to fully fund the medicare medicare prescription drug program social security military and civil servant pensions they claim that the government will have to spend $ 114 t to do the things it is currently promising to do and it has n't set aside the money to do it that 's what is meant by an unfunded mandate firstly i would take with a grain of salt the calculations of any website which claims the us is a in its title you know they are coming to this with an agenda secondly this is money that the government has not actually spent the government does n't owe this money to anyone and it is absolutely untrue that you are responsible along with everyone else to pay this back the worst they can claim is that the government will one day have to spend it assuming that nothing else changes in that time a government could pass a law that reduced medicare or raised taxes and the unfunded mandate would simply go away thirdly the calculation must assume a time period over which the money is spent but the site carefully does n't specify it they can make the amount bigger or smaller as they choose just by changing the time period over which it is calculated to give an example an unfunded mandate is a bit like enrolling in a four year college course without knowing how you are going to pay for it you 've said you are going to spend money on tuition you may even have promised your mother you will finish the course but you can in fact drop out if you choose and you do n't owe anything for courses you have n't taken yet   some unfunded mandates can be legal obligations but this is n't one and in neither case are they money you actually owe that 's not to say that unfunded mandates are not a cause for concern they represent a discrepancy between what a government says it will do and what it can currently afford to do as an illustration of how this works you can look at either russia ten years ago or greece right now all the expenditures in these are being cut people are certainly angry but there is nothing they can do to force the government to make those payments

let 's break this into two parts the future value of the initial deposit and the future value of the payments + for the future value of the payments i adding those two formulas together will give you the amount of money that should be in your account at the end   remember to make the appropriate adjustments to interest rate and the number of payments   divide the interest rate by the number of periods in a year four for quarterly twelve for monthly and multiply the number of periods p by the same number   of course the monthly deposit amount will need to be in the same terms see also annuity finance theory wikipedia

i will just try to come up with a totally made up example that should explain the dynamics of the hedge consider this completely made up relationship between usd eur and gold now lets say you are a european wanting to by 20 grams of gold with eur equally lets say some american by 20 grams of gold with usd their investment will have the following values see how the europeans return is while the american only has a return now lets consider that the european are aware that his currency may be against him with this investment so he decides to hedge his currency he now enters a currency swap contract with another person who has the opposite view locking in his eur usd at t2 to be the same as at he now goes ahead and buys gold in usd knowing that he needs to convert it to eur in the end but he has fixed his so that does n't worry him now let 's take a look at the investment see how the european now suddenly has the same return as the american of instead of it is hard in real life to create a perfect hedge therefore you will most often see that the are not totally the same as per answer but they do come rather close

my mention of lego being expensive is in my personal experience of sets as i grew up where what were seemingly similar sets appeared to skyrocket in price over a matter of years   another point of reference for me is the fact that retro collectors lego is supposedly still of lesser value than modern sets making it almost a reverse collector 's item if you 're into that kind of vintage collectable

an xbox currently sells for $ 200 but you do n't have the money right now to buy it   you think the price of the xbox is going up to $ 250 next month your friend works at bestbuy and says he has a that allows you to buy the xbox for $ 200 but the expires next month   he offers to sell you the for $ 5 when you buy his for $ 5 you are locking in the right to buy the xbox for $ 200 it is like an option because it locks in the purchase price it has an expiration date it locks in a purchase price and it is not mandatory that you redeem it that 's an explanation for a call option in kids terms   for more easy answers to the question what is a call option click now   a put can be answered in a similar way   suppose you bought the xbox for $ 250 and then the price drops back to $ 200   if you keep your receipt you have the right to return sell the xbox back for $ 250 even though the current price is only $ 200   bestbuy has a 30 day return policy so your receipt is like a put option in that you can sell the xbox back for a price higher than the current market price    that 's a simple example of a put option in kids terms   for more easy answers to the question what is a put click now

the cayman islands has an income tax enacted it is just currently 0   it raises revenues from its tourism import duties and business registration   it is part of the uk commonwealth and therefore enjoys the military protection of that federation but does n't have to spend on it but unlike the us the uk does not have an umbrella federal income tax on its overseas territories so the cayman islands does n't have to pass that down to its citizens nor do its citizens residents have to be by one it was not taxed by the king when it was first incorporated hm might need to fact check that they also did n't go to war with the king over some small tax so they got treated differently than some other north american colonies you might think of the cayman islands is not the only government that raises revenues this way delaware also has a 0 income tax and raises the majority of its revenues on business registration and perpetual franchise taxes on those businesses allowing it to spare its citizens from passive income taxes but unlike a us state a citizen or business in a uk overseas territory does not have federal regulatory overhead making it more attractive as a worldwide financial center

usually backtests for long term strategies are evaluated on a end of day basis where you only consider close prices if your strategy performs well in these backtests hopes are that if you use a market on close moc order your performance will not diverge too much from the backtest the fact that it wo n't diverge much is important if you keep backtesting the strategy along with the real trading to see regime changes or similar   if you used end of day prices for the backtests but some arbitrary intraday market order you 'd have some difficulties to explain deviations between the two what it is   moc orders can be submitted during the day but they wo n't be executed until shortly before the market or more precise the current session closes

the advantage of having a mortgage rather than borrowing money in other ways is that it is cheaper because the loan is secured against the value of the property   if you stop paying then the bank take the house and can sell it keeping what they are owed and returning any excess if you have enough money to pay it off then you do not need the mortgage   they normally run for 25 years   it is a lovely day when finally you realise that you own the whole house and no longer owe anything to the bank and the charge against the house is removed and the record of it removed from the land registry    when you sell a house with a mortgage the buyer has to check that the bank has been paid off before they accept the property

yes you can do that but you have to have the stocks issued in your name stocks that you 're holding through your broker are issued in street name to your broker if you have a physical stock certificate issued in your name you just endorse it like you would endorse a check and transfer the ownership if the stocks do n't physically exist you let the stock registrar know that the ownership has been transferred to someone else as to the price the company does n't care much about the price of private sales but the taxing agency will in the us for example you report such a transaction as either a gift irs form 709 if the transaction was at a price significantly lower than the fmv or significantly higher on the other end or a sale irs form 1040 schedule d if the transaction was at fmv

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

disclosure was at a financial blogger conference i attended last month i had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company also i recognize a number of the names of their financial backers this does n't guarantee anything of course except the people behind the scenes are no the same way prosper and lending club have created a market for personal loans this is a company that offers real estate loans   the too good to be true aspect is what i 'll try to address i 've disclosed in other answers that i have my real estate license earlier this year i sold a house that was financed with a hard money loan not a bank but a group of investors they charged the buyer 10 let me state i represented the seller and when i found out the terms of the loan it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal i felt sick for days after that sale   there are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20 down for 25 the same way there 's a business local to my area that offered a 10 loan is doing something similar but in a crowd sourced way it seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6 24 months the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time i 'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house but have bad timing i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved   as a final side note i recalled the 10 story in a social setting and more than one person responded they 'd have been happy to invest their money at 6 i could have saved the buyer 4 and gotten someone else nearly 6 more than they get on their cash

i 've had the same thoughts recently and after reading investing at level 3 by james i believe his thesis that for the passive investor you 're giving up too much if you 're not 100 in equities he is clear to point out that you need to be well aware of your withdrawal horizons and has specific tactics for shifting the portfolio when you know you must have the money in the next five years and would n't want to pull money out when you 're at a market low the kicker for me was shifting your thought to a plotting a straight line of reasonable expectations on your return then you do n't worry about how far down you are from your high or up from your low but you measure yourself against the expected return and you 'll find some real grounding you 're investing for the long term so you 're going to see 2 3 bear markets that is n't the the time to get cold feet and react stay put and it will come back the market gets back to the reasonable expectations very quickly as he confirms in all the bear markets and recessions of any note he gives guidelines for a passive investing strategy to leverage this mentality and talks about into an active strategy but does n't go into great depth so if you 're looking to invest more passively this book may be enough to get you rolling with thinking differently than the traditional 70/30 split

i agree this article does n't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession    instead it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost that is simply not so nothing is that simple   there are n't just jobs and ceo jobs the economy is more complex than that   we lost a lot of high paying jobs in the recession that just wo n't ever come back especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy the fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as i see it   i 'm just happy that we 're adding jobs the inequality thing will always be an issue and i hope it gets better but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

i think to some extent you may be confusing the terms margin and leverage from investopedia two concepts that are important to traders are margin and leverage margin is a loan extended by your broker that allows you to leverage the funds and securities in your account to enter larger trades in order to use margin you must open and be approved for a margin account the loan is collateralized by the securities and cash in your margin account the borrowed money does n't come free however it has to be paid back with interest if you are a day trader or this may not be a concern but if you are a swing trader you can expect to pay between 5 and 10 interest on the borrowed money or margin going hand in hand with margin is leverage you use margin to create leverage leverage is the increased buying power that is available to margin account holders   essentially leverage allows you to pay less than full price for a trade giving you the ability to enter larger positions than would be possible with your account funds alone leverage is expressed as a ratio a 2:1 leverage for example means that you would be able to hold a position that is twice the value of your trading account if you had $ 25,000 in your trading account with 2:1 leverage you would be able to purchase $ 50,000 worth of stock margin refers to essentially buying with borrowed money   this must be paid back with interest   you also may have a margin call forcing you to liquidate assets if you go beyond your margin limits leverage can be achieved in a number of ways when investing one of which is investing with a margin account

one implication is the added fees if you are investing in something with a trading cost or commission such as your stock purchase if you pay low costs to trade e.g. with a discount broker and do n't switch your investments often then costs overall should remain reasonable but always be aware of your costs and seek to minimize them

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

if the check is written as a check to bigco it is less clear how jack can compensate himself for the equity sale it is as if the equity was owned by the corporation not by jack this is correct   if the check is written to bigco then it is bigco issuing new shares   jack does n't compensate himself for the equity sale as he did n't sell anything   the company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion   in the long term the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $ 200,000 no interest loan to the company    if the value of the company before investing $ 250,000 is $ 1 million then the value after investing is $ 1.25 million   so $ 250,000 is 20 of the value of the company   bigco should not give the buyer 25 of bigco but only 20 in that example   if it does give 25 the buyer is getting a $ stake for only $ 250,000    with the other example jack sells 25 of the company for $ 250,000 from his personal shares   this does n't change the assessed value of the company just jack 's stake   jack then loans the company $ 200,000   this also does n't change the assessed value of the company at least in theory   it gains $ 200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $ 200,000   in net that 's no change   assets and liabilities balance the same    so if you know that the assessed value of the company is $ 1 million and that the buyer is paying $ 250,000 for a 25 stake at that same valuation then you know that the check is being written to jack   if the check is written to bigco then one or more of those numbers is incorrect    the buyer could be getting a 20 stake   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1.25 million    or paying $   the new value of the company after the investment is $    or bigco could only be worth $ 750,000 before the investment   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1 million    or jack is getting screwed selling $ in stock 25 for only $ 250,000   jack 's shares drop from being worth $ 1 million to only $   the value of the company is $ 1.25 million    or some combination of smaller changes that balances

i recently sold some property in which i structured the agreement with my realtor such that i would pay the normal 6 commission 3 to each agent if the buyer came from another agent if my selling agent found his own buyer he would get 4.5 commission as a seller it 's possible to negotiate such deals before the house goes on the market if you are selling another property you could similarly structure such a deal where your selling agent picks up the commission from buying the new place and agrees to reduce the commission on the place that you are selling leaving you in a better position than if you bought unrepresented as an unrepresented buyer you only have negotiating power insofar as the market allows the seller 's agent gains nothing from what you propose so unless they expect trouble moving the house waiting to see what other offers arise is certainly an option if they are having trouble moving the house then just reduce your offer and see what happens   when i pick a selling price the main factor is that i want to attract enough buyers that i can sell it quickly interest payments do add up selling a house involves more than just listing it for sale i have a good relationship with my agent and have done multiple deals with him i am willing to pay him because i believe it benefits me to do so i would n't risk that relationship just to close a deal with an unrepresented buyer that unrepresented buyer would allow for a reduced commission to 4.5 though in the contract i mentioned above

it sounds like a great opportunity but like any opportunity you need to do your research and give it a thorough evaluation although the current owner may be your friend do n't let emotion get in the way of a fair and honest assessment    some general things you need to consider   past financial data of the pizza restaurant if you are going to invest you want your investment to pay off and to be profitable what are the historical you take management of the pizza restaurant are there things you can do to cut costs increase profits    understand the competition that is around the area does your pizza restaurant have a competitive edge that will enable to succeed in another location     do you enjoy working there would you enjoy working there more than the prospective work you would do as a    finally if you want to invest what kind of investment structure what are your rights as a shareholder what is your ownership stake what happens in the case of share dilution going back to financials how long do you estimate conservatively that you will be able to make back the principal investment   now referring to your other question of is it worth the risk to give up guaranteed money   it is harder and harder for younger people like you and i to depend solely on fixed salary jobs if you want financial success you want to build assets for yourself that generates income without you expressly there recording your hours on a time card    no money is ever guaranteed there are many risks associated with a person 's whose only source of income is from his day job    finally you do n't necessarily have to put up the investment with your own money and give up school you could look for other investors or take a loan on the business to open a new store there 's nothing wrong leveraging debt it will help you save tax money    anyways i 'm glad you 've found this opportunity remember to always think big but be smart about it too    p.s. if you want to pm me any specifics for me to look at in terms of financials or legal stuff i 'd be more than happy to help a brother out

imagine a $ 1,000 face value bond paying 10 interest semi annually that means every 6 months there is $ 50 being paid now if the price of that bond doubled to $ 2,000 what is the yield it is still paying $ 50 every 6 months but now sports a 5 yield as the price went up a great deal similarly if the price of the bond was cut in half to $ 500 now it is yielding 20 because it is still paying out the $ 50 every 6 months the dollar figure is fixed what percentage of the price it is can vary and that is why there is the inverse relationship between prices and yields note that the length of the bond is n't mentioned here where while usually longer bonds will have higher yields there can be inverted yield curves as well as calls on some bonds also inflation indexed and convertible bonds could have different calculations used as principal adjustments or possible conversion to stock can change a perception on the overall return

willis group holdings set to join the s&p 500 fossil group to join s&p midcap 400 health to join s&p smallcap 600 notes in part for the s p case willis group holdings plc nyse will replace fossil group inc.    nasd in the s&p 500 and fossil group will replace towers    watson co. nasd in the s&p midcap 400 after the close of    trading on monday january 4 willis group is merging with towers    watson in a deal expected to be completed on or about that date    pending final conditions post merger willis group holdings will    change its name to willis towers watson plc and trade under the ticker    symbol fossil has a market capitalization that is more    representative of the midcap market space as of jan. 8 fossil is about $ in market cap and willis is $ for those wondering apple with a market cap of $ is of the index making the entire index worth approximately $ so fossil is worth of the overall index for those wanting some numbers here thus if a company acquires another and becomes bigger than there can be replacements made in those indices that have an artificial number of small members alternatively a member may be removed for lack of representation where it is just so small compared to other companies that may be a better fit as some indices could be viewed as actively managed in a sense in contrast there are indices like those from russell known for the russell 2000 small cap index q why do n't you the indexes more often than once a year a maintaining representative indexes must be weighed against the    costs associated with making frequent changes to index constituents    namely buying and selling stocks the russell indexes are annually because our research    has shown that this strikes a reasonable balance between accuracy and    cost we originally our indexes quarterly then    semi annually but found these options to be suboptimal our extensive    research demonstrates that annual accurately represents    the capitalization segments and minimizes the turnover required to    reflect the segments as they change thus there can be different scenarios   then there can be the effect on index funds when price weighted indices like the dow jones industrial average has a member that does a stock split that causes some rebalancing too on the djia divisor the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index that    is calculated by dividing the sum of the prices of the 30 component    stocks dow jones industrial average components by a number called    the djia divisor or dow divisor the index divisor is updated    periodically and adjusted to offset the effect of stock splits bonus    issues or any change in the component stocks included in the djia    this is done in order to keep the index value consistent

yes an estate plan can be very important   estate planning typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in in general your estate includes all of your assets less all debt plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust the biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or prevents you from acting for yourself in addition tax is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates to create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney when you consult with an estate planning attorney the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax strategies that would be appropriate and appealing what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of and any complicating family issues to deal with these issues your attorney will need full and accurate information about you including when an estate plan is created be sure you understand what the attorney is saying estate planning ideas can be confusing it is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorney 's fee for any legal service some articles and resources get ahead of your estate planning estate planning by cba

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

i 've been told by staff in my local car hire agency that they get such big discounts that they actually make money selling the cars so they replace all their cars every six months in the uk the number plate indicates when the car was registered in six month periods this suits the manufacturers because it means they can offer a lower cost product to price sensitive customers while charging more to people who want something brand new for example you could buy a brand new fiesta for £ 14,000 or a 6 month old version of the same car with a few thousand miles on the clock for £ 12,000 this means if you only have £ 12,000 then you can afford to buy a nearly new fiesta but if you can afford a bit more then ford will happily take that off you for a brand new fiesta ford sell an extra car and if the car hire company only paid £ 11,000 then they make some profit too

how is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market the average investor probably makes some bad decisions you also might need to take transaction costs into play including borrowing on margin so that there 's a natural erosion of returns across the market   meaning if transaction borrowing costs are 1 and the market return is 5 the average investor   alternatively if by average they mean the average of the population not weighted by amount it 's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors and have larger relative transaction costs thus having a lower average on a per capita basis does n't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions no   if my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10 return compared to the average 12 return then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10 not to make 14

in a sense yes there 's a view in yahoo finance that looks like this    for this particular stock a market order for 3000 shares not even $ 4000 this is a reasonably small figure will move the stock past $ 1.34 more than a 3 move   say on the ask side there are 100,000 shares all with $ 10 ask it would take a lot of orders to purchase all these shares so for a while the price may stay right at $ 10 or a bit lower if there are those willing to sell lower   but say that side showed $ 10 1000 $ 500 $ 10.50 1000 now the volume is so low that if i decided i wanted shares at any price my order a market order will actually drive the market price right up to $ 10.50 if i buy 2500 shares market   you see however even though i 'm a small trader i drove the price up but now that the price is $ 10.50 when i go to sell all 2500 at $ 10.50 there are no bids to pay that much so the price the next trade will occur at is n't known yet there may be bids at $ 10 with asking me at $ 10.50 no trades will happen until a seller takes the $ 10 bid or other buyers and sellers come in

the simplest answer is that you can convert the ira to a roth and since it was already taxed pay no tax on conversion   if in your hypothetical situation you happen to have an ira already in place you are subject to pro rata rules on conversions e.g. your balance is total $ 40 k $ 10 k not deducted a conversion is 75 taxed convert $ 20 k and the tax is on $ 15 k of that money but there also might be a time when you are able to transfer ira money into a 401(k effectively removing the pretax deposits and leaving just post tax money for a free conversion

when i invest in a business valued at $ 50,000 i pay $ 25,000 and receive 50 equity does that $ 25,000 go to the current owner of the business or into the capital of the business itself   who receives the money depends on who is selling you the equity   there are a couple of different scenarios that can fit your question you could buy existing shares from the current owner(s of the company   in this case the current owner(s would be receiving the funds from you and in return giving you their stake in the company   so if you all agree that the value of the business is $ 50,000 and you give $ 25,000 to the current owner(s they give you half of their shares   the value of the company has not changed the company could be issuing new shares   this is called stock dilution or an increase in authorized share capital   let 's say that everyone agrees that the value of the business is $ 50,000   the company could create new shares and sell them to you for $ 25,000   in this case the value of the company has jumped to $ 75,000 you now control one third of the company and the existing owner(s who previously owned 100 of the company now only own two thirds   in order for you to end up with 50 of the company in this case you would have to invest $ 50,000 instead which would result in the company being valued at $ 100,000    if you are wondering why the current owners would agree to this second scenario there are two questions that address this

before i answer you should know a few things about me i 've paid to get into a couple of network marketing multi level marketing franchises and i made a little money in it i have worked in financial services sales i later went on to get my masters in business administration i 've been there and i know mlms and business in theory and practice there 's room for some nuance here but for the most part do n't do it there 's no snake oil out there that people ca n't get on their own if you can sell it to them then here 's the simple case against it if you 're a good enough salesman to get other people to buy products or franchises from you and really you do n't care about product sales you care about franchise sales because that 's how they sold it to you right you can make far more money selling business to business   if you 're a good enough sales manager that you can get good salespeople to buy franchises from you and sell more franchises you 'll make far more money managing salespeople selling business to business   for the most part people are n't good at sales and that likely includes you most mlm 's are sales groups with bad salespeople leading bad salespeople it 's the blind leading the blind and as your friends get burned and your family gets burned and you start losing everyone who got burned you 'll start to wish you had never done this stuff in the first place the main reason the above holds true is that the people involved in mlm do n't really create any value they 're looking to get a free ride on everyone else in the pyramid beneath them   there are exceptions the main ones that come to mind are like mary kay where ok mostly women makeup artists teach women how to apply makeup without looking like a clown and it 's a skill and it 's part of how they create value and it may well be the best option for someone whose chosen career is a makeup artist i 'm not particularly an exception but at the age of 17 i sold books door to door in southern mississippi mostly to teach myself how to talk to people since i had grown up with my nose in a book it turned out that the business was structured like a mlm to encourage the salespeople to become managers but i had no interest in that i just wanted to learn people skills i also blew a couple hundred bucks on franchise fees on other mlms mostly because friends were in it never did i see that money ever again   sales is hard work teaching people how to sell is even harder and impossible if you do n't know how if you 're good at it you 'll do so much better in a business to business setting think about the economics of it salespeople get paid on volume of sales businesses have a lot more money than consumers you have to sell to an awful lot more consumers than businesses to make the same amount of money think about competition too considering amway you 're competing with everyone from walmart to the corner convenience store and you will be asking everyone and their brother to join up and many of them have already been pitched it if they 've been around long enough the bargaining strength of your customers they have lots of alternatives and suppliers their over priced pricing structure is set in stone is pretty strong you have immense direct competition and product substitutes and anyone else can go into the same business as you your competitive position is extremely weak it 's almost guaranteed to fail you probably do n't have the skills you 'll burn your relationships and you 'll make more money doing almost anything else

with the caveat that you should always read the fine print generally the high water mark is the absolute highest mark at end of any quarter sometimes month over all the quarters months in the past   intra quarter marks do n't matter    so in your example the mark at the end of the second quarter would only be the new if that mark is higher then the mark at the end of every previous quarter   again what happened in the middle of of the second quarter does n't matter for hedge funds the may only be be from the date you started investing rather than over the whole history of the fund but i would be surprised if that was true for any mutual funds   though as i may have mentioned it is worth reading the fine print

why are self checkout lanes always available because people do n't want the do extra work   sure this is be a good idea in a small convenience store setting but not a large grocery store   it just seems like a complete logistical nightmare especially with produce   with massive upfront construction costs or costs and then add in the new preventative maintenance and monitoring costs   do you truly see savings when cashiers are cheap   on top of everything you are still going to have lines   a week 's worth of groceries does n't bag itself

you start taking on some big risks when go to absolute zero unlike your plane analogy you do n't have to fly or not fly you can opt to take a safer hybrid form of transit or to extend the analogy now you 're driving or walking instead of flying which per mile traveled is statistically more risky even if the plane feels and looks riskier   consider reading up a bit on the risks of all cash bonds including shortfall and inflation yes real estate is a hedge but most of your portfolio is still exposed to inflation why not also buy some treasury inflation protected securities via a bond fund why not put 25 in the stock market to help do well when the markets do well   i think if you do some reading on this you 'll find yourself shocked at the risks of being all cash fwiw i 'm a relatively conservative voice on investing subreddits the guy who is usually saying hey be sure to keep some so i 'm all about a safe balanced portfolio but tilt too far in either direction and you take on more risk not less   you mentioned a pension and real estate those are presumably good inflation hedges and relatively stable holdings the pension especially suggests you can take more stock risk since you have that stable bond like holding   the thing to me is that you would be all in during the good times if you 're this risk adverse when you see warning signs i 'm curious were you 100 stocks before totally on off like that seems kinda intense

everyone complaining about fraud and jail time have no idea what they are talking about fraud in a financial sense is very difficult to prove it is also very expensive to litigate furthermore there is little evidence there was any actual fraud rather a number of things just went wrong at the time you had the chairman of the federal reserve ben bernanke and the treasury secretary henry paulson both going on tv saying subprime was n't an issue and even if it was it would n't affect the wider mortgage market the regulators knew what was going on and did nothing at the time because none of the economic models anyone used showed we would go into recession

you lose your agent services when my wife wrecked our car 3 years ago our agent took care of everything   he got us a rental car made the arrangements to get it fixed checked in to see how we were doing and even helped us set up a second opinion on my wrist surgery   the accident was ruled the fault of the uninsured driver who decided to take off through the red light   but our insurance was the one that covered it all total expenses over 80k   we would have had to eat most of those with out full coverage    most everything was set up our rental car estimates on repair even her with the surgeon before the investigator had filed her report our agents first question was is everyone ok his second was what can i do to help he never asked us what happened and was always ahead of our needs in dealing with it    if these things are not important to you you can probably save quite a bit of money self insuring   but if you are in an accident and unable to do them yourself do you have someone to do it for you   do you trust them to handle your business and are you willing to saddle them with the responsibility of dealing with it   to me insurance is less about me and more about my family   it was nice that my agent did all of that for me   i would have been willing to do it myself though   but i am glad to know he is there for my wife if something happens to me

going to gather up some data for you that displays the various drug discoveries new drugs etc by country companies in those countries    i ’m not saying that the system is n’t fucked or that drug prices are n’t absurdly high or that there are n’t corporations out there not trying to give back to the world but $ $ $ is will always be the foundation of any business to churn a profit how do you do that you develop a good product sell the good product and make your money back and then some for doing all the work yes there are some holes that need to be plugged i.e. generic drugs still being absurdly priced gouging between insurance companies and the drug companies but how can you throw shit in the face of one pharmaceutical company when it ’s an industry wide problem with so many different variables at play    you build a pharmaceutical company raise the billions of necessary funds to run trials 99 of which will never amount to an actual product the company can sell without relying on public offerings selling stock = shareholders come across some more billions still without selling stock to raise money to market and produce your drugs from your successful clinical trials all costing amounts of $ $ $ and let me know how you ’re shit is expensive the people who bitch about the broken system offer up no realistic economically sound means of fixing that system there ’s no such thing as a free lunch what makes sense morally does not always translate to making sense economically as fucked up as that is there are tons of problems in this   world and i ’m not saying i have answers to any of them but you need to be able to see the opposing view of an argument as well to fix a problem
