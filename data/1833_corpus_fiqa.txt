you may think it sucks to have learned a crap ton of category theory which is seemingly useless outside of academia but have you considered picking up a functional programming language e.g.   how about java or more recently i would bet that you would love   and then you can make a fortune working at jane street capital which uses another functional programming language time to get your hands dirty with some programming experience   minimal social skills required as you had wished for plus maximal compensation plus you get to keep using math that was sort of close to your research area good luck

the classic nigerian scam involves sending fraudulent cashier 's checks to recipients who then deposit them in their account   the bank reverses these deposits once they discover the check is not valid   at least in the us and in the parts of the eu i 'm familiar with the netherlands the method of the nigerian scam is consistent and banks will reverse the deposit after some holding period given this it 's unlikely that most banks will convert an arbitrary cashier 's check to cash without any means to recover the amount should the check be fraudulent

yes and no this really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument a company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping this is the only area where a company must behave democratically with one share one vote if you own one share in a company specifically a voting share then you are entitled to attend an agm where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board you might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the agm but i would n't rely on it you will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board notice i said control not own if you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you then you effectively control their shares shareholders are there to get a return on their investment so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board that they put there convince them that for example a lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not morals ethics justice etc are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans they have no place in your arguments with one exception goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions you can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments

stock prices are n't constant they rise and fall    the overall return on a share is the combination of the dividends paid plus the change in value of the share   some companies pay no dividend at all yet investors still buy their shares because they believe the share price will rise people invest in stocks because they believe that the overall return will exceed what they can get from cash in the bank    as to options they do offer higher potential profits but they also offer higher potential losses   different investors have different appetites for risk   many are comfortable with the risk of mainstream stock investing but not with that of options trading

i have had similar thoughts regarding alternative for the reasons you mention but for the most part they do n't exist   gold is often mentioned but outside of 1972 1974 when the us went off the gold standard it has n't been very effective in the diversification role   cash can help a little but it also fails to effectively protect you in a bear market as measured by portfolio drawdowns as well as std dev relative to gov't bonds there are alternative assets reverse etfs etc which can fulfill a specific short term defensive role in your portfolio but which can be very dangerous and are especially poor as a long term solution while some people claim to use them for effective results i have n't seen anything verifiable i do n't recommend them gov't bonds really do have a negative correlation to equities during periods in which equities underperform timing is often slightly delayed and that makes them more valuable than any other asset class as a   if you are concerned about rate increases avoid lt gov't bond funds   intermediate will work but will take a few hits short term bonds will be the safest   personally i 'm in 30 and willing to take the modest hit in exchange for the overall portfolio protection they provide against an equity downturn   if the hit concerns you tips may provide some long term help assuming inflation rises along with rates to some degree i personally think tips give up too much return when equity performance is strong but it 's a modest concern tips may suit you better than any other option   in general i 'm less concerned with a single asset class than with the long term performance of my total portfolio

there are several areas of passive fraud by being unclear on what you are doing   when a citizen buys a house the mortgage lender wants all the details as to how the buyer rounded up the money   that is so they can use their own formulas to assess the buyer 's creditworthiness and the probability that the buyer will be able to keep up on payments taxes and maintenance or have they overextended themselves the fraud is in the withholding of that info by way of tricking them into making a favorable decision when they might not have if they 'd had all the facts   then there 's making this sound all good intentions no strings attached no expectations you 're lying to yourself   what you 've actually done is put money between yourselves because you have not laid down fair rules to cover every possibility   you 're not willing to plan for failure because you do n't want to admit failure is possible which is vain   once you leap into this bell jar the uncertainty of what happens if will itself into everyone 's thoughts slowly your relationship   it 's a recipe for disaster   that uncertainty puts her in a very uncomfortable position   she has to labor to make sure the issue does n't explode so she 's around you to avoid fights   every fight she 'll wonder if you 'll play the breakup card and threaten to demand the money back   the money will literally come between you this is what money does   thinking otherwise is a young person 's mistake of inexperience   do n't take my word on it contact suze orman and see what she says your lender is also not going to like those poorly defined lovers promises because they 've seen it all before and do n't want to yet again foreclose on a house that fighting lovers trashed   it 's like superhero battles are awesome unless you own the building they trashed   this thing can still be done but to remove this fraud of wishful thinking you need to plan for every possibility agree to outcomes that are fair and achievable put it in writing and share it with a neutral third party   you have n't done it because it seems like it would be awkward as hell and it will be or it will test your relationship by forcing direct honesty about a bunch of things you have n't talked about or are afraid to and it will and to be blunt your relationship may not be able to survive that much honesty   but if it does you 'll be in much better shape    the other passive fraud is taxes   by not defining the characteristics of the payment you up the question of how your contribution will be taxed if it will be taxed a proper contract with each other will settle that   there 's an argument to be made for involving a tax advisor in the design of that contract so that you can work things to your advantage   as an example defining the payment as rent is about the worst you could do as you will not be able to deduct any home expenses she will need to pay income tax on the rent but she can can not take landlord 's tax deductions on anything but the fraction of the house which is exclusively in your control i.e. none

to be honest i think a lot of people on this site are doing you a disservice by taking your idea as seriously as they are not only is this a horrible idea but i think you have some alarming misunderstandings about what it means to save for retirement first off precious metals are not an investment they are store of value the old saying that a gold coin would buy a suit 300 years ago and will still buy a suit today is pretty accurate buying precious metals and expecting them to appreciate in the future because they are undervalued is just flat out speculation and really does n't belong in a well planned retirement account unless it 's a very small part for the purposes of diversification so the upshot to all of this is the most likely outcome is you get zero return after inflation maybe you 'll get lucky or maybe you 'll be very unlucky next you would say that sure you 're giving up some expected return for a reduction in risk but you 've done away with diversification which is the most effective way to minimize risk and i 'm not sure what scenario you 're imagining that the stock market or any other reasonable investment does n't make any returns if you invest in a market wide index fund then the expected return is going to be roughly in proportion with productivity gains to say that there will be no appreciation of the stock market over the next 40 years is to say that technological progress will stop and/or we will have large scale economic disruptions that will wipe out 40 years of progress if that happens i would say it 's highly questionable whether silver will actually be worth anything at all i 'd rather have food property and firearms so to answer your question practically any other retirement savings plan would be better than the one that you currently outlined but the best plan is just to put your money in a very low cost index fund at vanguard and let it sit until you retire the expense ratios are so stupidly small that it 's not going to meaningfully affect your return

the most important thing in my view is flexibility to avoid running into problems one useful thing in the uk would be an arranged overdraft you go to your bank and they 'll agree that you can overdraw your account by a certain number of pounds depending on your income etc it will cost you a very high interest rate but only for each day where you are overdrawn so paying a bill two days before your salary comes in is n't too bad obviously avoid using the overdraft if you can having an overdraft while not using it is free it 's meant for an emergency being regularly overdrawn is expensive but once it is arranged with your bank an arranged overdraft is much much cheaper than bouncing cheques etc and possibly high fees for overdrawing your account and it takes the pressure of you   now things to need before you get a loan again uk the real interest rate that you are paying is called apr that 's the number that counts and that can not be manipulated no payday loans to avoid getting yourself into deep deep trouble no loan sharks obviously if you buy things with interest free credit that 's a included in the price so you pay more and b if you miss paying by one day they 'll hit you with huge interest payments and some will try this intentionally interest rate depends on loan amount i once had to borrow 20 more than i needed because it reduced the interest rate by half the 20 went straight into a savings account credit cards and overdrafts are much more expensive than loans mortgage is again cheaper than a loan usually make sure that you only use money from sources that charge the least amount make sure you pay back regularly so cheap sources stay available to you   just do yourself a favour and if at all possible spend less instead of getting a loan

a company is basically divided into shit the company owns assets and shit the company owes to people liabilities so what about ownership ownership is called equity and on a simplistic level equity = asset liabilities but a better view of that should be asset = liabilities + equity which means a company 's assets   is separated into things owned by debtors e.g. banks and things owned by and you so when you are offered one percent you are basically owning one percent of the company    not the best explanation but should be a simplified one    here 's where the options come in when you are offered options that means you have the option of redeeming the shares at a lower price than market however these options are not usually immediately redeemable there 's usually a minimum amount of time you have to work at a company to be able to use these options this period is called the vesting period

i 'm going to subtly and change the obvious advice there are three ways to deal with negative cashflow not two you 're currently studying for a degree you do n't say what country you 're in or how your studies are funded but most people in the us uk and a fair number of other countries run up debts while studying for a degree they do this because a degree is valuable to them they ca n't avoid it because the tuition alone costs more than most students can generate in income never mind their living expenses so by all means look for savings 1 clearly strangers on the internet ca n't just think up ways for you to spend less money without knowing anything about what you do spend money on but you can at least list your expenditures for yourself and see what 's necessary consider also how much fun you want your studies to be 4 years in a cold house to avoid paying for heating and never going out with friends to avoid spending on unnecessary stuff is all very well but with hindsight you 'll regret yourself if you 're ever well off enough to pay back whatever you would have borrowed to use for heating and fun only do 2 if it does n't affect your studies or if the money you 're paid justifies delaying the valuable asset you seek to acquire a degree leading perhaps to a better job but at least to the capacity to do a full time job rather than fitting work around your studies there are some jobs that are really good fits for students reasonably low hours that do n't clash with classes and some jobs that are terrible if these fail resort to 3 i do n't mean dishonest book keeping i mean accept that you are going to borrow money in order to pay for something of value that you can account as an asset work out now what you 'll need to borrow and how you think you can pay it back make sure the sum is worth it budget for that stick to your budget you 'll still have negative cashflow nothing changes there but your capital account looks fine personally i would n't actually put a monetary value on the degree i 'm not that bothered about the accounts and it 's really difficult to be accurate about it you can just consider it more than i expect to borrow and be done with it studying costs money once you 've graduated you probably are n't going to be back here saying i want to buy a house but i have no capital and i do n't want to go into debt are you although if you are the answer happens to be islamic mortgage i do n't know whether islamic banks have an equivalent answer for student debt since they ca n't own a share of your degree like they can a share of your home unless you 're a muslim presumably the ways that islamic finance avoids interest payments would not in any case satisfy your desire to be not in debt

i understand that itm have little time value so they will have small time but why otm has a lesser theta than atm the time value represents uncertainty   that uncertainty decreases the farther away from atm you get in either direction   at the money there is roughly a 50 chance that the option expires worthless as you get deeper in the money the change that is expires worthless decreases so there is less uncertainty there is more certainty that the option will pay off   as you go deeper otm the probability that the option expires worthless increases so there is also less uncertainty at the ttm decreases the uncertainty theta decreases as well since there is less time for the option to cross the strike from either direction   similarly as volatility decreases theta decreases since low volatility stocks have a less change of crossing the strike

there is no one answer to this question but there are some generalities most exchanges make a distinction between the passive and the aggressive sides of a trade   the passive participant is the order that was resting on the market at the time of the trade   it is an order that based on its price was not at the time and therefore goes into the order book   for example i 'm willing to sell 100 shares of a stock at $ 9.98 but nobody wants to buy that right now so it remains as an open order on the exchange then somebody comes along and is willing to meet my price i am glossing over lots of details here   so they aggressively take out my order by either posting a market buy or specifically that they want to buy 100 shares at either $ 9.98 or at some higher price most exchanges will actually give me as the passive i.e. liquidity making investor a small rebate while the other person is charged a few fractions of a cent   google found details and most other exchanges make their fees public as well   as of this writing the generic price charged credited but they provide volume discounts and many of the larger deals do fall into another tier of volume which provides a different price structure

your current loan is for a new car your refinanced loan would probably be for a used car they have different underwriting standards and used car loan rates are usually higher because of the higher risks associated with the loans people with better credit will tend to buy new cars this does n't mean that you ca n't come out ahead after refinancing but you 'll probably have to do a bit of searching i think you should take a step back though 5 is n't that much money and five years is a long time nobody can predict the future but my experience tells me that the is going to hit the fan at least once over any five year period and it 's going to be a really big dump at least once over any ten year period do you have savings to cover it or would you have to take a credit card advance at a much higher interest rate are you even sure that 's an option a lot of people who planned to use their credit card advances as emergency savings found their credit limits slashed before they could act i understand the desire to reduce what you pay in interest but and now i do n't hesitate to give savings priority when i have some excess cash there 's no one size fits all answer but should have at least one or two months of income saved up before you start considering anything like loan prepayments

gt;you bring up a very good point if he cares so much about his employees but it 's just too inconvenient for him to run the company if his taxes go up 5 why not sell it instead of putting 7000 people out of a job why threaten people when there 's an obvious alternative hell if he just wants to close it anyways he could just give the company away   it 's funny you think we 're talking about only 5 liabilities could go up 10 15 it 's not just taxes its insurance liabilities and other requirements what business experience do you have you obviously are n't considering all the angles here and it 's not about caring or not caring about his employees believe it or not i 'll bet he did n't start the company 40 + years ago to create jobs for his employees caring for employees only gets you so far he probably cares for them as much as he cares about his office or his properties but if one of his office became condemned and dealing with it became more stressful than profitable guess what he 'd blow it up and never look back   he explicitly states that he will downsize or close the company if there are any new taxes whatsoever on either him or the business it 's also worth noting that his company is currently more profitable than its ever been   but that comes down from somebody who has seen increased liabilities increased over the decades its all or nothing at this point and it would n't be a tiny increase in liabilities gross profit = /= net profit   gt;what   obama has used the argument you did n't build that to say you benefited from other people 's taxes to get where you are but guess what government existed just fine without increased taxes it 's only now that they want to maintain and will increase the level of spending they need more revenues and private participation in things like the healthcare plan   gt;yeah so maybe he should cut his bullshit rhetoric when those jobs are on the line and the only one responsible for their fates is him and if it 's really too much of a bother for him to run the company if he 's making slightly less money when he 's already said he has more money than he 'll ever need he can promote someone else to run the company or just sell it saying he cares about his employees makes him a liar criticizing people who spent beyond their means makes him a hypocrite and his empty threats and beating make him a bully   jobs are a byproduct of his goal and thus peripheral they are that way for every company unless it 's a very small company the employees are not more important than the business itself   you keep this as slightly less but its not its millions and millions    the point is it is his company and he can do whatever he wants you obviously have no actual decision making business experience because if you did and talked to these people you 'd realize they 're not all greedy yes some make quite a bit of profit but you 'd also be amazed at all of the liabilities government requirements and yes taxes they have to deal with   right or wrong it 's choice to decide what happens not yours not mine

a call gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a particular price the price called the strike price is fixed when you buy the option let 's run through an example aapl trades $ you think it 's going up over the next year and you decide to buy the $ 280 call for $ 12   here are the details of this trade your cost is $ 1200 as options are traded on 100 shares each you start to have the potential to make money only as apple rises above $ 280 and the option trades in the money it would take a move to $ for you to break even but after that you are making $ 100 for each dollar it goes higher at $ 300 your $ 1200 would be worth $ 2000 for example a 16 move on the stock and a 67 increase on your money on the other hand if the stock does n't rise enough by january 2011 you lose it all   a couple points here american options are traded at any time if the stock goes up next week your $ 1200 may be worth $ 1500 and you can sell if the option is not in the money its value is pure time value there have been claims made that most options expire worthless this of course is nonsense you can see there will always be options with a strike below the price of the stock at expiration and those options are in the money of course we do n't know what those options were traded at   on the other end of this trade is the option seller if he owns apple the sale is called a covered call and he is basically saying he 's ok if the stock goes up enough that the buyer will get his shares for that price for him he knows that he 'll get $ the $ 280 plus the option sale of $ 12 for a stock that is only $ today if the stock stays under $ 280 he just pocketed $ 12 4.6 of the stock value in just 3 months this is why call writing can be a decent strategy for some investors especially if the market goes down you can think of it as the investor lowering his cost by that $ 12 this particular strategy works best in a flat to down market of course in a fast rising market the seller misses out on potentially high gains   i 'll call it quits here just to say a put is the mirror image you have the right to sell a stock at a given price it 's the difference similar to shorting a stock as opposed to buying it if you have a follow up question happy to help edit apple closed on jan 21 2011 at $ the $ 280 call would have been worth $ vs the purchase price of $ 12 nearly 4x return a gain in just over 4 months for a stock move of 26 this is the leverage you can have with options any stock could just as easily trade flat to down and the entire option premium lost

i 'll start by focussing on the numbers i highly recommend you get comfortable with spreadsheets to do these calculations on your own   i assume a $ 200 k loan the mortgage for a $ 250 k house scale this up or down as appropriate for the rate i used the current us average for the 30 and 15 year fixed loans you can see 2 things first even with that lower rate to go 15 years the payment required is 51 higher than with the 30 i 'll get back to that second to pay the 30 at 15 years you 'd need an extra $ 73 because now you are paying at a 15 year pace but with a 30 year rate this is $ to keep that flexibility these are the numbers   there are 2 camps in viewing the longer term debt there are those who view debt as evil the $ payment would keep them up at night until it 's gone and they would prefer to have zero debt regardless of the lifestyle choices they 'd need to make or the alternative uses of that money to them it 's not your house as long as you have a mortgage but they 're ok with the local tax assessor having a statutory lien and his hand out every quarter the flip side are those who will say this is the cheapest money you 'll ever see and you should have as large a mortgage as you can for as long as you can treat the interest like rent and invest your money   my own view is more in the middle look at your situation i 'd prioritize   in my opinion it makes little sense to focus on the mortgage unless and until the first 5 items above are in place the extra $ to go to 15 if it 's not stealing from those other items or making your cash flow tight go for it   keep one subtle point in mind risk is like matter and energy it 's not created or destroyed but just moved around those who offer the cliche debt creates risk are correct but the risk is not yours it 's the lender 's looking at your own finances liquidity is important you can take the 15 year mortgage and 10 years in lose your job the bank still wants its payments every month even if you had no mortgage the tax collector is still there to keep your risk low you want a safety net that will cover you between jobs illness new babies being born etc   i 've gone head to head with people insisting on prioritizing the mortgage payoff ahead of the matched 401(k deposit funny they 'd prefer to owe $ 75 k less while that $ 75 k could have been deposited pretax so $ 100 k for those in the 25 bracket and matched to $ 200k. do n't make that mistake

if we take only the title of the question can the ceo short the stock it was probably different before enron but nowadays a ceo can only make planned trades that is trades that are registered a very long time before and that can not be avoided once registered so the ceo can say i sell 100,000 shares in exactly six months time then in six months time the ceo can and must sell the shares anything else will get him into trouble with the sec quite automatically i do n't know if shorting a stock or buying options can be done that way at all so it 's possible only in the sense of it 's possible but you 'll be in deep trouble   selling shares or exercising share options may indicate that the company 's business is in trouble if the sale makes that impression and everyone else starts selling because the ceo sold his shares then the ceo may be in trouble with the board of directors such a sale would be totally legal if announced long time ahead but just a bad move if it makes the company look bad shorting sales is much worse in that respect if the ceo wants to buy a new car he may have to sell some shares there are people paid almost only in share options no matter where the share price is going but shorting shares means that you most definitely think the share price is going to drop you 're betting your money on it that would tend to get a ceo fired even if it was legal

yes there are a number of reasons for this most notably some form of tax credits transfer over from year to year if you file your taxes and the cra will only pay you deductions if all your taxes have been filed if you do n't owe them anything you wo n't necessarily get in trouble but do n't expect to get any money back from them until you file also while it 's probably much too late for this if you have a partner you can transfer a certain amount of tax deductions to them and save them some money the site is here

i appreciate the time and thought you put into your comment i however disagree with much of what you said i do n't think you understand the anti business mentality at all in fact calling it to me sounds just horribly slanted the that are by the business community should not be dismissed because they are hard to track even if the statement is true it does n't matter there is no excuse and frankly statements like that sound extremely    with that said i agree with you 100 that a lot of the discourse on this subreddit is not conducive to discussion learning i certainly do n't want to discourage you from posting the frustration the business community feels by being misunderstood is certainly shared by the other side if you would like to hear my thoughts on anything specific feel free to ask

government subsidies could be provided if we could all agree what activities are of higher social worth this is not an insurmountable obstacle   for example in hong kong and singapore civil servants are paid vastly more than in the us the reasons are that society wants to attract some of its best people to serve in these positions and they want to insulate them from the temptation of corruption in effect these positions are considered to be of high social worth and society rewards them accordingly    also note that hk and singapore have even freer capitalist market societies than the us speaking of economic freedom here

since you are not paying the full balance off each month you are carrying a balance from month to month that balance is being charged some interest rate x. with a balance transfer the new credit card pays off that balance as a result you now have a balance of the same amount plus any processing charges on the new credit card hence the balance has transferred from the old to the new and you now pay the new credit card ideally you do this because the new credit card is offering a reduced interest rate saving you money though be warned often that transfer rate is a limited time deal and any left over after the window expires will be charged the higher rate

sure thing   treasuries bonds bills are what the us gov uses to borrow however it 's slightly different than taking out a loan it 's basically an agreement to give repay a set sum of money at a certain time in the future in exchange for a sum of funding that 's determined by market forces supply amp demand the difference between today 's price and the payment in the future is the interest    for example completely made up numbers   today is the government issues a bond that say it will pay who ever owns this bond $ 105 on the market decides that $ 105 from the us government paid a year from now is worth $ 100 today    in other words the us government is borrowing for one year at a rate of 5        105 100 100 = .05 = 5   now consider saudi arabia 's petroleum company aramco   because petroleum is traded in dollars when aramco makes a sale its paid in usd some of that is going to be reinvested into the company some paid out in dividends to share holders but inevitably some of that will be saved someplace where it can make interest because treasuries are traded issued in dollars and because aramco 's businesses deals primarily in dollars treasuries are the natural place to store that savings especially because the market considers them extremely safe    if they exchange the usd into the saudi currency to store the money in saudi assets aramco is subject to   exchange rate if the depreciates relative to the dollar aramco will lose wealth on the exchange back to dollars when they go to move those funds back into their business it 's in their interest to deal with assets denominated in usd i.e. t bonds in order to avoid this   so now because the saudis want t bonds as well the additional demand pushes the market price of our bond from $ 100 to $ 102 and the effective one year borrowing rate for the government goes from 5 to 2.9       105 = = 2.9   and there you have it cheaper borrowing it 's also worth noting how this encourages business around the world to deal in dollars which are directly controlled by the federal reserve this makes the us 's position extremely powerful

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

what sort of amount are we talking about here and what countries are you travelling to   as long as it 's not cash most countries will neither know or care how much money is in your bank account or on your credit card limit and ca n't even check if they wanted to even if they can there are very few countries where they would check without already you of a crime i think you 're worrying over nothing even if it 's cash most countries have no border control anyway and those who do uk ireland allow up to £ 10,000 or so cash without even having to declare it just open a second bank account and do n't take the card or cut the card up use online banking to transfer money in smaller chunks to your main account alternately or additionally take a credit card or two with a smaller limit enough to make sure you 're comfortably able to deal with one month plus emergency money then set up your regular bank account to pay this credit card off in full every month if i was really concerned i 'd open a second bank account and add a sensible amount of money to it enough to cover costs of my stay and avoid questions about whether i can afford my stay but not so much it would raise question then i 'd open two credit cards with a limit of perhaps $ 1000 2000 one covers the costs of living wherever i 'm going the other is for emergencies or if i and go over my amount per month set up your bank to pay these off each month and you 're sorted honestly i think you 're worrying over nothing people travel inside europe every day with millions in the bank and raise no questions you 're legally allowed to have money

a the credit rating agencies only look at the month end totals that are on your credit card as this is all they ever get from the issuing bank so a higher usage frequency as described would not make any direct difference to your credit rating b the issuing bank will know if you use the credit with the higher frequency but it probably has little effect on your limit typically after two to three month they reevaluate your credit limit and it could go up considerably if you never and at this time it could indirectly positively affect your credit rating you could consider calling the issuing bank after two month and try to explain the history a bit and get them to increase the limit but that only makes sense if your credit score has recovered your business paperwork could go a long way to convince someone if you do so well now c if your credit rating is still bad you need to find out why it should have normalized to a medium range with the bad historic issues dropped

i think many of you are making unrelated comments and taking unjustified conclusions from the news without reading the research many of the mentioned share provisions are not exclusive to silicon valley technology firms or the rest of private equity i.e. ex vc   the paper says   gt;these generous terms are not necessarily evidence of active post money valuation manipulation and could simply be due to a difficult fund raising environment   and   our discussion does not imply that these terms were given for the purpose of manipulating spacex ’s value   that is not to say that i am not skeptical of many of the business models and valuations of the companies in the sample but that is off the research topic    what the authors suggests is that valuation is often by many people in the industry and provides some relevant cases from mutual funds who market those shares at the value of the most recent funding round regardless of share provisions to employees that wrongly perceive their wealth   i have some trouble accepting brownian motion to model exit prices or pretty much anything else it seems a bit off from reality but nevertheless i think the paper is worth the read

i 'm surprised by all the pro credit answers here debit has some definite advantages most importantly when you pay with a credit card the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company in many states they are forced to charge you the same amount and this is frequently as consumer protection but consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction and they 're legally forbidden to do anything about it so you 're taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation   to make matters worse the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices by a small amount so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing on the other hand the credit card company wins big and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place to put in the worst possible light it 's essentially legal extortion on corruption as for the fraud protection offered while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hassle free reimbursement i.e. you just do n't have to pay the bill if your card is stolen consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost

generally in a swift transaction there are 4 banks involved at times 2 or 3 or at times even 6 the 4 banks are sender originator of payment sender 's correspondent receiver 's correspondent receiver or beneficiary bank all these 4 banks charge for making a transfer in sha the charges of sender and correspondent are levied to customer who initiates the payment and the receivers correspondent and receiver charges are to beneficiary in our all the charges of 4 banks are to the customer and in ben all the charges of 4 banks are to the beneficiary or am i wrong to assume that transaction costs would be covered by that and in reality the are on top of transaction costs as explained above it is incorrect assumption in this case the charges will be more so best is go with sha this gives a better view of charges on a eur to usd transactions there would typically be only 3 banks in the chain and depending on the bank it could also be just 2 banks involved

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

your comment regarding your existing finances is very relevant and helpful you need to understand that generally in personal finance circles when a strong earning 22 year old is looking for a loan it 's usually a gross spending problem    their car costs $ 1,000 and their bar tabs are adding up so the only logical thing to do is get a loan   most olds do n't have a mortgage up their income or a newborn    with all of this in mind i essentially agree with and personally and many people here would probably disagree i 'd stop the 401(k contribution and use that money to pay the debt   you 're still very young from a retirement standpoint let the current balance ride and forego the match until the debt is paid   i think this is more about being debt free at 22 quickly than it 's about how much marginal money could be saved via 401(k or personal loan or this strategy or that strategy   i think at your age you 'll benefit greatly from simply being debt free there are other very good answers on this site and other places regarding the pitfalls of a 401(k loan   the most serious of which is that you have an extremely limited time to pay the entire loan upon leaving the company   failure to repay in that situation incurs tax liability and penalties    from my quick math assuming your contribution is 8 of $ 70,000 you 're contributing something in the neighborhood of $ to your 401(k   if you stopped contributing you 'd probably take home a high $ 300 number net of taxes   it 'll take around 20 months to pay the loan off using this contribution money without considering your existing payments in total you 're probably looking at closer to 15 months   you 'll give up something in the neighborhood of $ 3,500 in match funds over the repayment time    but again you 're 22 you 'll resume your contributions at 24 still way ahead of most people from a retirement savings standpoint   i do n't think my first retirement dollar was contributed until i was about 29   sure retirement savings is important but if you 've already started at age 22 you 're probably going to end up way ahead of most either way   when you 're 60 you 're probably not going to giving up a few grand of employer match in your 20s that 's what i would do edit i actually like 's suggestion in the comments below   if there 's enough vested in your plan that is also available for withdrawal that you could just scoop $ 6,500 out of your 401(k net of the 10 penalty and federal and state taxes which would be on the full amount to pay the debt i 'd consider that instead of stopping the prospective contributions   that way you could continue your contributions and receive the match contributions on a prospective basis   i doubt this is a legitimate option because it 's very common for employers to restrict or forbid withdrawal of employee and/or employer contributions made during your employment but it would be worth looking in to

when i left the uk four years ago free banking is still an option and i 'm pretty sure it still is   therefore you have chosen to have a bank account with a charge    in return for this charge you will be eligible to receive certain benefits   for example reduced borrowing costs discounted mortgage rates free overdraft on small amounts rewards for paying household bills by direct debit and things of this sort    amongst these benefits may be preferential savings rates   however from hmrc 's point of view it will be the extra perks you are paying for with your monthly charge   you have chosen to pay for the account and hmrc is not interested in how you choose to spend your money only in the money you earn while i agree with you that it does have an element of unfairness the problem is how would you divide the cost amongst the various benefits

you are asking about a common simple practice of holding the mortgage when selling a house you own outright typically called seller financing   say i am 70 and wish to downsize the money i sell my house for will likely be in the bank at today 's awful rates now a buyer likes my house and has 20 down but due to some medical bills for his deceased wife he and his new wife are struggling to get financing i offer to let them pay me as if i were the bank we agree on the rate i have a lien on the house just as a bank would and my mortgage with them requires the usual fire theft insurance when i die my heirs will get the income or the buyer can pay in full after i 'm gone   in response to comment how do you do that what 's the paperwork fellow member @littleadv has often posted you need to hire a professional not because the top members here ca n't offer great accurate advice but because a small mistake on the part of the diy attempt can be far more costly than the relative cost of a pro in real estate where i am an agent you can skip the agent to hook up buyer seller but always use the pro for legal work in this case a real estate attorney i 'd personally avoid the general family lawyer going with the specialist here

it appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here the stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the company 's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices they chose to increase production by investing to invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that the key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term in the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news people who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so want a piece of it this will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run the effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat the short term price changes usually back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits for investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed roce that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price the higher the roce the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow a to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same roce as they currently produce it is possible that by investing in new more productive equipment they can raise their roce but also possible that because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so roce will fall for the new capital

short answer no there is no financial benefits for you to expect in a local currency even if some might give tiny discounts on local sales local currencies are attractive for small business or communities they are perfectly legal and starting to be popular in a lot of places local currencies encourage individuals and businesses to exchange goods and services locally   using them is like investing in your community it could give you the feeling of doing something good for your community check this article for a discussion on the subject   they should not be considered investments local currencies do not offer the same financial security and some could be like monopoly money but that would be another subject or question to debate   so to summarize no money to be made for your personal use but some real social and financial benefits for your community that be a kind of personal benefit for you

the hst is a sales tax levied on most goods and services it is important to realize that in both bc and ontario the new hst does not in most cases result in an increase in sales tax paid for example in ontario the pst is 8 and when combined with the gst the sales tax is 13 with the hst the gst and pst are replaced by a single hst of 13 so the tax bill does not change some services that were previously not subject to pst such as mutual fund service fees and labour will now be subject to the hst so some things will increase over time this should not have a material impact on the consumer due to the way businesses remit gst hst

my advice is that if you 've got the money now to pay off your student loans do so   you 've saved up all of that money in one year 's time   if you pay it off now you 'll eliminate all of those monthly payments you 'll be done paying interest and you should be able to save even more toward your business over the next year over the next year you can get started on your business part time while still working full time to pile up cash toward your business   neither you nor your business will be paying interest on anything and you 'll start out in a very strong position    the interest on your student loans might be tax deductible depending on your situation however this does n't really matter a whole lot in my opinion you 've got about $ 22k in debt and the interest will cost you roughly $ 1k over the next year why pay $ 1k to the bank to gain maybe $ 250 in tax savings starting a business is stressful there will be good times and bad how long will it take you to pay off your debt at $ 250 a month 5 or 6 years probably by eliminating the debt now you 'll be able to save up capital for your business even faster and when you experience some slow times in your business your monthly expenses will be less

the early history of paper money did not evolve the way i described in the earlier posts although it could have and would have got to the same place instead the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage vaults of precious metals i.e. early banks   do read david 's debt the first 5000 years the first credit money almost certainly originated with the books held by the temples in the middle east thousands of years ago the history of our current monetary system can trace it 's origins to the medieval gold but ours is not the first credit money system by a long stretch

customers also have different needs and the more extreme the need the more likely they 're going to rate you so even if you completely fulfill a customer 's need unless it was an extreme need or they were in a predefined emotional state you 're not likely to get a review   as an example we used to actually fix things at our radio shack with and such in store a few people would give us feedback about that we were also allowed leeway on what we could take for returns receipt 30 day limit etc so if the customer came in and started telling me how our products sucked and they were calling the bbb it 's unlikely they would receive the queen bee treatment they also gave reviews yelp was n't around at the time   in short despite the fact we gave the vast majority of our customers way above par treatment the people most likely to give reviews were self entitled despite what people say about turning customers around from angry to nice this only happened with maybe 1 out of every 5 pissy customers another two would probably be shown to be attempting to scam the store in some manner and a fourth would likely have to be shown the door

i do n’t disagree that housing prices are important and vital to the economy but i think they are a separate issue to inflation requires a different set of tools to deal with and has completely different outcomes from policies    first and foremost they are almost the only item purchased that can be resold at a higher value so even though house prices may have risen 1000 who ever had bought a house exits with a 1000 increase in equity how would account for that when calculating inflation

fixed   you are confirming the amount you are going t pay over the term of the loan variable over the total difference over the life of the loan comes to around $ 1200 that is the wrong way to calculate the variable portion the variable is primarily set with a margin over a certain benchmark i.e. fed rate assuming the fed rate does n't change over or only goes lower the variable rate is the one to go if it rises then your payment will increase and the margin they take over the benchmark rate may increase so the total amount you pay might increase too   i would assume a read through the t&cs should clarify that for you is it ever a good idea to choose a variable rate loan only if you think we are in a low interest rate environment i.e. the economy is in and the feds are trying to simulate the economy by decreasing the benchmark rates and you are sure that the lender is n't going to increase his margins if the rate remains low for quite a substantial amount of time and i might assume there will be penalties for paying off a loan quicker

are mortgages always sold for less than the remaining principal no they 're almost always sold for more than that the buyer will take a loss if the homeowner pays off the loan immediately but that 's very unlikely the buyer is hoping that the owner will payoff the loan as scheduled and they 'll make a tidy profit from the interest charged the originator now makes their profit immediately and has their capital back so they can make more loans

it 's not really fair for him to say share buybacks are 4 of gdp because share buybacks do n't directly contribute to gdp presumably if a company has excess cash than what can profitably be reinvested into the business then it should return that cash to the shareholders buybacks then it is up to the shareholders to decide how to reallocate that capital theoretically shareholders will allocate that capital into profitable ventures the assumption being distributing capital to profitable ventures is more efficient than distributing capital to non profitable ventures and the efficient distribution of capital should increase gdp in the long run   if you believe that sort of thing personally i d rather that every employee was paid a respectable wage for their labor not the bare minimum that they 'll accept to avoid starvation but that 's another issue all together so nevermind

short time horizon small pot of money and low appetite for risk   that smells like low return situation to me i guess it depends on how low your appetite for risk is though   you could open a brokerage account free and purchase $ 10 k worth of a fully diversified etf like vti optionally putting maybe 20 of it in a diversified bond etf   i consider that a reasonably conservative investment but if you are of the mindset that you can not tolerate a drop in your wealth it 's not going to work   plus if you do n't have any other investments this will be the thing that requires you to report capital gains to the irs and that paperwork is never fun as an alternative you have cd 's which will make you very little   or a high ish interest rate electronic savings account like capital one 360 or direct there are probably newer ones now that even these   still with anything in this paragraph you will be lucky to beat inflation   the real interest rate was negative last time i checked so every risk free investment will lose money in purchasing power terms   to beat inflation you will need to take on risk

years before retirement is n't related at all to the pretax ira roth ira decision except as income typically trends up over time for most people   if tax rates were constant both at income levels and over time roth and pretax would be identical   say you designate 100k for contribution 20 tax rate   80k contributed in roth vs. 100k contributed in pretax then 20 tax rate on withdrawal ends up with the same amount in your bank account after withdrawal you 're just moving the 20 tax grab from one time to another    if you choose roth it 's either because you like some of the flexibility like taking out contributions after 5 years or because you are currently paying a lower marginal rate than you expect you will be in the future either because you are n't making all that much this year or because you are expecting rates to rise due to political changes in our society   best is likely a diversified approach some of your money pretax some   at least some should be in a pretax ira because you get some tax free money each year thanks to the personal exemption   if you 're working off of 100 post tax you are paying more tax than you ought unless you 're getting enough social security to cover the whole 0 bucket and probably the 10 bucket also so for example you 're thinking you want 70k a year   assuming single and ignoring social security as it 's a very complicated issue joe taxpayer has a nice blog article regarding it that he links to in his answer you get $ 10k or so tax free then another $ 9k or so at 10 almost certainly lower than what you pay now   so you could aim to get $ 19k out of your pre tax ira then and out of your post tax ira meaning you only pay $ 900 in taxes on your income   of course if you 're in the 25 bucket now you may want to use more pretax since you could then take that out all the way to around $ 50k standard exemption + $ 40k or so point where 25 hits   but on the other hand social security would probably change that equation back to using primarily roth if you 're getting a decent social security check

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

gt despite the fact that this correlation between immigration and wages is well documented   link does not go to proper documentation link goes to another article on the same site with the title 3 reasons why mass immigration is bad for the economy and subtitle is immigration good for the economy   no not always please make up your minds   gt the evidence suggests otherwise including new data reported by fox   it looks like this bit is the closest thing there to proper data   gt just how bad is it according to the national association of home builders more than 56 percent of developers nationwide are reporting labor shortages    gt says the problems started when the recession hit and domestic construction workers dropped out of the market to find other jobs at the same time immigrant workers went back to their home countries but as the economy has picked up and the construction industry has heated up those workers have remained missing    yeah that 's not even close to as clear as they 're making it out to be   gt in fact according to ted of residential strategies inc. construction costs have risen by 30 this year the majority of which is due to higher wages and increased overtime pay   heh that fox article says wages are about 60 of costs a bit of math says that a 30 increase in costs that was due entirely to wage increases would mean wages had gone up by 50 that 's a missed opportunity by the article writers the headline really should say that wage growth is up to 50   math given $ 100 costs $ 60 would be labor a 30 increase is + $ 30 if that 's all from labor it would have gone from $ 60 to $ 90 and 90 60 = = 1.5 or a 50 increase     also back to the leading paragraph   gt there is a strong correlation between immigration particularly illegal immigration and wages   this should be obvious to anyone familiar with the fundamental principle of supply and demand more supply workers means lower prices wages and vice versa   there 's an example of how it 's nowhere near that simple at   gt many claim that immigrants negatively affect the labour market prospects of native workers in advanced countries this column studies a large change in immigration restrictions in the us the 1965 exclusion of almost half a million mexican seasonal farm workers from the us labour market the exclusion did not increase the employment or wages of native workers and technology adoption was one of the adjustment channels    note i 'm not saying wrong this time the article is specifically about a case where there was existing technology available to replace the lost workers

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

there is a highly related question which is much easier to answer what normally value increasing news about a company would cause that company to fall in value in the public stock market by answering that we can answer your question by proxy the answer to that question being anything that makes investors believe that the company wo n't be able to maintain the level of profit for example let 's say a company announces a 300 profit growth compared to the previous year this should push the stock upwards maybe not by 300 but certainly by quite a bit let 's also say that this company is in the business of designing manufacturing and selling some highly useful gadget that lots of people want to buy now suppose that the company managed such an profit increase by one of in scenario 1 firing the engineering department it is highly unlikely that the company will be able to come up with manufacture and sell a next generation gadget hence while profit is up now it is highly likely to go down in the months and years coming up because stock market investors are more interested in future profits than in past profits this should push the value of the company down in scenario 2 selling off the machinery the company may very well be able to come up with a next generation gadget and if they can manufacture it they might very well be able to sell it however no matter how you slice it the short term costs for manufacturing either their current generation gadget or the next generation gadget are bound to go up because the company will either need to rent machinery or buy new machinery neither is good for future profits so the value of the company again should go down in response in scenario 3 their product getting a large boost the company still has all the things that allowed them to come up with produce and sell gadgets they also have every opportunity to come up with manufacture and sell next generation gadgets which implies that future profits while far from guaranteed are likely in this case the probability remains high that the company can actually maintain a higher level of profit hence the value of the company should rise now apply this to a slightly more realistic scenario and you can see why the value of a company can fall even if the company announces for example record profits hence you are looking for news which indicate a present and sustained raised ability to turn a profit this is the type of news that should drive any stock up in price all else being equal obviously buyer beware your mileage may vary all else is never equal nothing ever hits the average you are fighting people who do this type of analysis for a living and have every tool known available to them etc etc but that 's the general idea

disclaimer i am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert this page on the hmrc site lists several pages that appear to be relevant starting with foreign currency delayed remittances and on to foreign currency example which seems pertinent to your case paraphrased a property bought in 1983 is sold for a taxable gain in one tax year but the proceeds can not be released remitted to the uk until later by which time currency fluctuations have created a second taxable gain the size of the first gain selling the property is determined by the exchange rate in effect at the time of the sale but because of local restrictions this can be deferred   the size of the second gain currency movement is determined by the change in exchange rate between the time of the sale and the time of conversion in your case the first gain was actually a loss so i believe you should be able to use this to offset any tax due second gain   this page states that losses can be claimed up to four years after the end of the tax year in which they were incurred so you are probably still ok the example makes application under to defer the gain made on the original sale because of the inability to transfer funds but as i understand it this is primarily to avoid a tax liability in that year   since you made a loss on the sale there would n't have been a tax liability so there would be no need to defer it

for the first part of your question i think the answer is a combination of three things   1 bigger companies have leverage to negotiate better deals due to volume   2 some of these companies are also taking bookings from outside the us for people traveling to the us either directly or through affiliates   this means that they also have income in other currencies so they may not actually be making as many wire transfers as you think   they simply keep a bank account in europe for example in euros to receive and send money in the eurozone as needed   they balance the exchange on their books internally in this case without actually sending funds through the international banking system   similarly in other parts of the world 3 these companies are not going to make a wire transfer for every transaction in any case   they are going to transfer big sums of money to an account abroad to balance things on a longer term basis weekly month etc   then they will make individual payments to service providers out of the overseas account in between these larger international transfers for the second part of your question i think there 's probably no way for a new business to get the advantages of scale unless you 've got significant capital backing your endeavor that would make it plausible that you 'll be transferring in scale   i do n't see any reason in principle that the new company could not establish bank accounts abroad and try to execute the plan outlined in 2 above except that it would require some set up costs to do the proper paperwork in each country probably to travel and to initially fund the various accounts

i 'm not sure if you are including the use of credit cards in the intent of your   however i will give you some good reasons i use them even when i can pay cash 1 i get an interest free loan for almost 30 days as long as i do n't carry balances 2 i get a statement detailing where i am spending my money that is helpful for budgeting i 'd never keep track to this level of detail if i were using cash 3 many cards offer reward programs that can be used for cash back 4 it helps maintain my credit rating for those times i need to buy something and pay it off over time car house etc 5 not so much an issue for me personally but for people that live paycheck to paycheck it might help to time your cash outflows to match up with your inflows for a business i think it is mostly a cash flow issue that is in a lot of b2b type businesses customers can pay very slowly managing their own cash flows so your revenue can sometimes lag quite a bit behind the expenses that were associated with them e.g payroll a business line of credit can smooth out the cash flow especially for companies that do n't have a lot of cash reserves

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

i speak as a person without kids but i 'll give this a shot anyway using my memory of the perspective i had when i was a kid   my advice is if the kids are young enough to not care much do n't be afraid of the thrift store   my parents got a bunch of clothes from the thrift store as i was growing up around elementary school age and i did n't care at all   when i got to be older middle school age shopping at target and k mart did n't seem bad either   by the time the kids are old enough to really care beyond they are probably old enough to get their own part time jobs and get their own clothing i however am probably naive as i still care little for such things and judging from popular culture most care about them a great deal

in this case trust the real estate agent negotiating experience is one of the things you selected them for especially if they 're suggesting a lower number than you expected since they get paid on commission and so may be biased the other way   part of their job is to look for hints about how motivated this seller is and what price they might accept as opposed to what price they hope to get   and remember that the default assumption is that the two parties will meet in the middle somewhere which means it 's customary to offer 10 less to signal that you could probably be talked into it if they drop the price about 5 this is like bridge hand bidding it 's a semi formalized system of hints about levels of interest except with fewer conventions and less rationality as far as the seller paying the closing costs that 's really part of the same negotiation and doing it that way makes the discussion more complicated for the seller since they need to figure out how much more to charge you to cover this cost if they offer great factor that into what you are willing to pay but i would n't assume it or ask for it edit yes unless you have engaged a buyer 's agent which i recommend for first time buyers and maybe all their fiduciary duty is to the seller but part of that duty is to make the sale happen if the price goes too high and you walk away neither the agent nor the seller make money a bad agent can be as bad as a bad car salesman sure but if you do n't like and mostly trust your agent you are working with the wrong agent that does n't mean you give them every bit of information the seller might want but it does mean you probably want to listen to their input and understand their before deciding what your own strategy will be

they pay nearly $ 900 million per year in income taxes their effective rate is low because they have deferred tax assets which means they paid more in taxes years prior in order to get a lower effective rate now additionally they have a net loss which allows a business to reduce their tax burden two years prior or up to 20 years forward after losing money

so you are paying taxes on your contributions regardless the timing    is just different i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just    putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or    something like that what am i missing you are failing to consider the time value of money getting $ 1 now is more valuable to you than a promise to get $ 1 in a year even though the nominal amount is the same with a certain amount of principal now you can invest it and it will likely grow into a bigger amount of money principal + earnings at a later time and we can consider the two to have approximately equivalent value the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later with pre tax money in traditional ira the principal + earnings are taxed once at the time of withdrawal assuming the same flat rate of tax at contribution and withdrawal this is equivalent to roth ira where the principal is taxed at the time of contribution because the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later so the same rate of tax on the two have the same value of tax even though when you look at nominal amounts it might seem you are paying a lot less tax with roth ira since the earnings are never taxed with actual numbers if we take a $ 1000 pre tax contribution to traditional ira it grows at 5 for 10 years and a 25 flat rate tax we are left with $ 1000 1.05 ^ 10 0.75 = $ with the same $ 1000 pre tax contribution so after 25 tax it 's a $ 750 after tax contribution to a roth ira growing at the same 5 for 10 years and no tax at withdrawal we are left with $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ you can see they are equivalent even though the nominal amount of tax is different the lower amount of tax paid now is equivalent to the bigger amount of tax later with a taxable investment which you will not buy and sell until you take it out you contribute with after tax money and when you take it out the earnings portion is subject to capital gains tax but remember that the principal + earnings later is equivalent to the principal now which is already all taxed once and if we tax the earnings portion later that is effectively taxing a portion of the money again another way to look at it is the contribution is just like the roth ira but the withdrawal is worse because you have to pay capital gains tax instead of no tax you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ $ 750 = $ is earnings and is taxed again at say a 15 capital gains rate so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ you would need a capital gains tax rate of 0 to match the advantage of the pre tax traditional ira or roth ira after tax money in traditional ira has a similar problem the contribution is after tax but after it grows into principal + earnings the earnings part is taxed again except it is worse than the capital gains case because it is taxed as regular income like above you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ earnings is taxed again at 25 so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ so although the nominal amount of tax paid is the same as for pre tax money in traditional ira it ends up being a lot worse everything i said above about pre tax money in traditional ira after tax money in traditional ira and roth ira also applies to pre tax money in traditional 401(k after tax money in traditional 401(k and roth 401(k respectively regarding the question you raise in the title of your question why someone would get contribute to a traditional ira if they already have a 401(k the answer is mostly they would n't first note that if you merely have a 401(k account but neither you nor your employer contributes to it during the year then that does n't prevent you from deducting traditional ira contributions for that year so basically you can contribute to one or the other so if you only want to contribute below the ira contribution limit and do n't need the bigger 401(k contribution limit and the ira 's investment options are more attractive to you than your 401(k 's then it might make sense for you to contribute to only traditional ira if you or your employer is already contributing to your 401(k during the year then you can not deduct your traditional ira contributions unless your income is very low and if your income is really that low you are in such a low tax bracket that roth ira may be more advantageous for you if you make a traditional ira contribution but can not deduct it it is a non deductible traditional ira contribution i.e. it becomes after tax money in a traditional ira which as i showed in the section above has much worse tax situation in the long run because its earnings are pre tax and thus taxed again however there is one good use for non deductible traditional ira contributions and that is as one step in a backdoor roth ira contribution basically there is an income limit for being able to make roth ira contributions but there is no income limit for being able to make traditional ira contributions or for being able to convert money from traditional ira to roth ira so what you can do is make a non deductible traditional ira contribution and then immediately convert it to roth ira and if you did not previously have any pre tax money in traditional iras this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution with the same tax treatment but you can do it at any income level

your question is actually quite broad so will try to split it into it 's key parts yes standard bank isas pay very poor rates of interest at the moment they are however basically risk free and should track inflation   any investment in the 6 7 return range at the moment will be linked to stock stock always carries large risks ~50 swings in capital are pretty standard in the short run in the long run it generally beats every other asset class by miles if you ca n’t handle those types of short terms swings you should n’t get involved if you do want to invest in stock there is a hefty ignorance tax waiting at every corner in terms of how brokers construct their fees in a nutshell there is a different best value broker in the uk for virtually every band of capital and they make their money through people signing up when they are in range x and not moving their money when they reach band y or just having a large marketing budget and screwing you from the start at ~1 a year is def in this category there is n't much of an obvious way around this if you are adamant you do n't want to learn about it the way the market is constructed is just a total predatory for the complete novice there are middle ground style investments between the two extremes you are looking at bonds bond funds and mixes of bonds and small amounts of stock such as the vanguard income or conservative growth funds outlined here can return more than savings accounts with less risk than stocks but again its a very diverse field that 's hard to give specific advice about without knowing more about what your risk tolerance timelines and aims are if you do go down this or the pure stock fund route it will need to be purchased via a broker in an isa wrapper the broker charges a platform fee the fund charges a fund fee in both cases you want these as low as possible the telegraph has a good heat map for the best value isa platform providers by capital range here fund fees are always in the key investor document under ongoing charges

a lot of people on here will likely disagree with me and this opinion    in my opinion the answer lies in your own motives and intentions    if you 'd like to be more cognizant of the market i 'd just dive in and buy a few companies you like   many people will say you should n't pick your own stocks you should buy an index fund or this etf or this much bonds etc   you already have retirement savings capital allocation is important there   you 're talking about an account total around 10 of your annual salary and assuming you have sufficient liquid emergency funds there 's a lot of non monetary benefit to being more aware of the economy and the stock market   but if you find the house you 're going to buy you may have to liquidate this account at a time that 's not ideal possibly at a loss if all you 're after is a greater return on your savings than the paltry 0.05 or whatever the big deposit banks are paying then a high yield savings account is the way i 'd go or a cd ladder yes the market generally goes up but it does n't always go up   get your money somewhere that it 's and you can be certain how much you 'll have tomorrow assuming a gain the gain you 'll see will pale in comparison to the deposits you 'll make   deposits grow accounts   consider these scenarios if you allocate $ 1,000 per month to this account    1 assuming an investment return of 5 you 're talking about $ 330 return in the first year not counting commissions or possible losses 2 assuming a high yield savings account at 1.25 you 're talking about $ 80 in the first year    also remember both of these amounts would be taxable i 'll admit in the event of 5 return you 'll have about four times the gain but you 're talking about a difference of on $ 12,000   over three to five years the most significant contributor to the account by far will be your deposits    anyway as i 'm sure you know this is not investment advice and you may lose money etc

you want more information on what the general bond market this article is getting at something different but the first several pages are general background info on the corporate bond market     if you are trying to relate somehow the issue of federal debt a la treasuries to corporate debt you will find that you are jumping to a lot of conclusions    debt is not exactly currency only the promise of repayment at a certain date in the future the only reason that u.s. treasuries and those of certain other highly rated countries is interchangeable is because they are both very liquid and have very low risk    there is very little similarity to this in the corporate bond market companies are no where near to the risk level of a government for one they ca n't print their own money and when a corporation goes bankrupt it 's bondholder are usually recovery rates hover at around 50 of the notional debt amount this is why investors demand a premium to hold corporate debt now consider even the best of companies take ibm the spread between the interest the government must pay on a treasury bond and that which ibm must pay on a similar bond is still relatively large    but beyond that you run into a liquidity issue currency only works because it is highly liquid if you take the article about greece you posted above you can see the problem generated by lack of liquidity people have to both have currency and be willing to accept currency for trade to occur corporate bond are notoriously illiquid because people are unwilling to take on the risk involved with holding the debt there are other reasons but i 'm from them this is the other reason treasuries can be used as currency there is always someone willing to take your treasury in trade for the most part because there is almost zero risk involved you would always be much more willing to hold a treasury than an equivalent ibm bond    now take that idea down to a smaller level who would want to buy the bonds issued by the mom and pop down the street even if someone did buy them who would in turn take these bonds in trade practically speaking no one would they have no way to identify the riskiness of the bond and have no assurance that there would be anyone willing to trade for it in the future    if you read the whole post by the redditor from your first link this is precisely why government backed currency came about and why the scenario that i think you are is very unlikely

you are missing the fact that the company can buy back its own shares for simplicity imagine the case that you own all of the shares of xyz corporation   xyz is very profitable and it makes $ 1 m per year   there are two ways to return $ 1 m to you the shareholder 1   the company could buy back some fraction of your shares for $ 1 m or   2   the company could pay you a $ 1 m dividend after 1 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 2 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 1 the total number of shares would be fewer but saying you owned less of xyz would be like complaining that you are shorter when your height is measured in inches than in so indeed a buyback is an alternative to a dividend furthermore buybacks have a number of tax advantages over dividends to taxable shareholders see my answer in can i get a dividend free lunch by buying a stock just before the ex dividend date and selling it immediately after   that said it is important to recognize the shareholders who are less savvy about knowing when to accept the buyback by correctly valuing the company can get burned at the profit of the savvy shareholders   a strategy to avoid being burned if you are n't price savvy is simply to sell a fraction in order to get your pro rata share of the buyback in many respects simulating a dividend but still reaping some but not all of the tax advantages of a buyback

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

for a cheaper hedge you can try a call spread e.g if you shorted a stock at 40 but are worried that it can get bought out for 60 then buy a 50 60 bull call spread with appropriate number of contracts or even 50 55 this is better than just buying a 50 call as it will be expensive also the other option is not to short but buy a debit bear put spread 40 30 near the money and then buy an out of money call spread 55 60

warren buffett pointed out that if you set 1 million monkeys to flipping coins after ten flips one monkey in about 1,000 actually would have a perfect track record of 10 heads if you can double your money every three to five years basically the outer limit of what is humanly possible you can turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in 30 50 years but your chances of doing this are maybe those of that one in 1,000 monkeys there are people that believe that if warren buffett were starting out today today 's version could not beat the historical version one of the believers is warren buffett himself if you read between the lines of his writings what the promoters do is to use the benefit of hindsight to show that if someone had done such and such trades on such and such days they would have turned a few thousand into a million in a few short years that 's easy in hindsight but then challenge them to do it in real time

i gift my daughter stock worth $ 1000 no tax issue she sells it for $ 2000 and has a taxable gain of $ 1000 that shows up on her return   yes you need to find out the date of the gift as that is the date you value the fund for cost basis the $ 3500 is n't a concern as the gift seems to have been given well before that it 's a long term capital gain when you sell it   and in a annoying aspect of our code the dividends get added to basis each year as you were paying tax on the dividend whether or not you actually received it depending on the level of dividends your basis may very well be as high as the $ 6500 current value   pls ask if anything here needs clarification

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

most of the time you 're selling to other investors not back to the company the stock market is a collection of bid buy offers and asks sell offers when you sell your stock as a retail investor at the market price you 're essentially just meeting whatever standing bid offers are on the market   for very liquid stocks e.g. apple you can pretty much always get the displayed price because so many stocks are being traded however during periods of very high volatility or for low volume stocks the quoted price may not be indicative of what you actually pay   as an example let 's say you have 5 stocks you 're trying to sell and the bid side order book is 2 stocks for $ 105 2 for $ 100 and 5 for $ 95 in this scenario the quoted price will be $ 105 the best bid price but if you accept market price you 'll settle 2 for 105 2 for 100 and 1 for 95 after your sell order goes through the new quoted price will be $ 95 for high volume stocks there will usually be so many orders near the midpoint price $ 105 in this case that you wo n't see any price slippage for small orders   you can also post limit orders which are essentially open orders waiting to be filled like in the above example they ensure you get the price you want but you have no way to guarantee they 'll be filled or not   edit as a cool example check out the bitcoin on coinbase for a live example of what the order book looks like for stocks you 'll see that the price of bitcoin will drift towards whichever direction has the less dense order book e.g. price upwards when there are far more bids than asks

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

none of your options or strategies are ideal have you considered looking at the stock chart and making a decision is the price currently up trending or is it down trending or is it going sideways as knuckle mentions you could just set a limit price order and if it does not hit by friday you can just sell at whatever price on friday however this could be very damaging if the price is currently down trending it may fall considerably by friday i think a better strategy would be to place a trailing stop loss order say 5 from the current price if the stock starts heading south you will be stopped out approximately 5 below the current price however if the price goes up your trailing stop order will move up as well always trailing 5 below the highest price reached if the trailing stop has not been hit by friday afternoon you can sell at the current price this way you will be protected on the downside only approx 5 below current price and can potentially benefit from any short term upside

you can not get your investment out and leave only the capital gains until they become taxable at the long term rate when you sell some shares after holding them for less than a year you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short term capital gains rate that is at the same rate as ordinary income   as an example if you bought 100 shares at $ 70 for a net investment of $ 7000 and sell 70 of them at $ 100 after five months to get your initial investment back you will have short term capital gains of $ 30 per share on the 70 shares that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $ the other $ 4900 = $ is tax free since it is just your purchase price of the 70 shares being returned to you   so after paying the tax on your short term capital gains you really do n't have your   initial investment back you have something less the capital gains on   the 30 shares that you continue to hold will become long term capital gains income to you only when you sell the shares after having held them for a full year or more the gains on the shares sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale

cd laddering is funding a few cds in succession for instance for 6 months each month you open up a 6 month cd rather than   opening up one big one doing this will give you monthly interest payments as each month a cd will reach maturity after 6 months at that time you can choose to roll over the principal in a new cd and keep the interest reinvest all etc etc etc you still get the benefits higher rates that cds offer but with greater flexibility and more frequent interest payouts the only downside that i 'm aware off is that you may end up with a slightly lower overall interest rate

there is a process called a backdoor ira    you now have effectively made a roth ira contribution in a year where technically you are n't eligible   you do not have to pay taxes on earnings with a roth ira   you are limited to the normal annual contribution to the ira roth or traditional    if you do n't convert your traditional ira contribution to a roth ira then you are right   that gains nothing except enhanced protection in bankruptcy   only do this if you are taking advantage of the roth rollover    i 'm ignoring rolling over a 401k into an ira as that does n't increase the amount you can contribute   this does   you can contribute the full $ 18,000 to the 401k and still make a full contribution to the backdoor ira    this is the tax advantaged form of an ira   this avoids double taxation   let 's assume that your investment can go into something with a 5 annual return and you pay a 25 tax rate does n't matter as it drops out   you are going to invest for thirty years and then withdraw   you initially have $ 1000 before taxes    with a regular investment    you now have $    with a pre tax ira    you now have $ it is not an accident that this is almost the same as the amount before the capital gains tax in the example without an ira    you avoided the $ capital gains tax   even though you paid a lot more tax you paid it out of the gains from investing the original $ 250 that you would have paid in tax    this helps you even more if the capital gains tax goes up in the future   or if your tax bracket changes   if you currently are in the 25 bracket but retire in the 15 bracket these numbers will get even better in your favor    if you currently are in the 15 bracket and worry that you might retire in the 25 bracket consider a roth instead   it also avoids double taxation but its single taxation is at your current rate rather than your future rate

in this case it looks like the interest is simply the nominal daily interest rate times number of days in the period from that you can use a spreadsheet to calculate the total payment by trial and error with the different number of days in each period any formula would be very complicated in the more usual case where the interest charge for each period is the same the formula is m = where is multiplication ^ is is division sorry do n't know if there 's a way to show formulas cleanly on here p = original principle r = growth factor per payment period i.e. interest rate + 100 divided by 100 e.g. 1 > 1.01 n = number of payments note the growth factor above is per period so if you have monthly payments it 's the rate per month the last payment may be different because of rounding errors unequal number of days per period or other technicalities using that formula here wo n't give the right answer because of the unequal periods but it should be close let 's see times an average of days per period gives + 1 = ^ ^ 5 1 = further off than i expected but ballpark

tl;dr there is no silver bullet you have to decide how much to invest and when on your own   averaging down definition definition of average down the process of buying additional shares in a company at lower prices than you originally purchased this brings the average price you 've paid for all your shares down breaking down average down sometimes this is a good strategy other times it 's better to sell off a beaten down stock rather than buying more shares   so let us tackle your questions at what percentage drop of the stock price should i buy more shares ex should i wait for the price to fall by 5 or 10 to buy more it depends on the behaviour of the security and the issuer is it near its historical minimum how healthy is the issuer there is no set percentage you can maximize your gains or your losses if the security does not rebound investopedia the strategy is often favored by investors who have a long term investment horizon and a contrarian approach to investing a contrarian approach refers to a style of investing that is against or contrary to the prevailing investment trend   on the other side of the coin are the investors and traders who generally have shorter term investment horizons and view a stock decline as a of things to come these investors are also likely to espouse trading in the direction of the prevailing trend rather than against it they may view buying into a stock decline as akin to trying to catch a falling knife your second question how many additional shares should i buy ex initially i bought 10 shares should i buy or 20 that depends on your portfolio allocation before and after averaging down and your investor profile risk take care when putting more money on a falling security if your portfolio allocation shifts too much that may expose you to risks you should n't be taking you are assuming a risk for example if the market bears down like 2008 averaging down or doubling up works well when the stock eventually rebounds because it has the effect of magnifying gains but if the stock continues to decline losses are also magnified in such cases the investor may the decision to average down rather than either exiting the position or failing to add to the initial holding   one of the pitfalls of averaging down is when the security does not rebound and you become too attached to be able to cut your losses and move on also if you are bullish on a position be careful not to slip the i down and add a t on said position invest with your head not your heart

security companies employing the same people who are currently police or military your property is your castle and you 'd only go to other properties that have rules that you consent to follow roads naturally would have the most lenient rules since their shareholders want as many normal people to use them as possible the difference from today is that the government sets up a monopoly of law that everyone must follow even though populations differ   rather than everyone fight to control the monopoly who sets up the rules we each have our own rules and competing security companies who may charge different prices based on what level of rule precision they must enforce such as a basic tier of policing violence theft higher tier for policing the sort of things that enforce today   basically if you want extra rules that are n't necessary and not very popular you pay for that in this way most people would be ok with not policing people who do behaviors such as casual or possession of dried plant life drugs   in this system trust and history matter a company who changed its name suddenly becomes brand new and therefore untested and with no history it must start at the bottom of the trust ladder brands are valuable precisely because they exhibit a history of the company you know 's cereal or toyota cars or apple computers are quality people regulate the market that 's the point the government is a monopoly so we customers do n't have control 1 vote every few years is much less than having 10 votes every day free market voting with our money

this link does it ok   basically you calculate percentage return by doing stock price now stock price before   you 're not calculating the rate of return hence no subtraction of 100   the standard is to do this on a daily basis stock price today stock price yesterday the most important and most misunderstood part is that you now have to analyze the data geometrically not   to easily do this convert all percentage returns with the natural log next you take the standard deviation of all of those results and apply exp   this answers the title of your question for convenience 's sake it 's best to annualize since volatility implied or statistical is now almost always quoted annualized   there are trading days each year   you multiply your result by 240 of trading days per return ^ 0.5 so if you 're doing this for daily returns multiply the result by 240 ^ 0.5 if you were doing it weekly you 'd want to multiply by 240 etc   this is your number for sigma   this answers the intent of your question for black scholes you do not convert anything back with exp bs is already set up for geometric analysis so you need to stay there the reason why analysis is done geometrically is because the distribution of stock returns is assumed to be even though it 's really more like

a qualifying distribution seems guaranteed to fall under long term capital gains but a disqualifying distribution could also fall under long term capital gains depending on when it is sold so what 's the actual change that occurs once something becomes a qualifying as opposed to a disqualifying distribution yes a qualifying distribution always falls under long term capital gain the difference between qualifying and disqualifying is how the bargain element of benefit is calculated in case of disqualifying distribution it is always the discount offered irrespective of the final sale price of the stock in case of qualifying distribution it is lower of actual discount or profit thus if you sell the stock at same price or slightly lower price than the price on exercise date your bargain element is less this is not the case with disqualifying distribution

the answer do n't use your actual card number some banks offer virtual credit card numbers services like apple pay are functionally the same bank of america 's virtual cards work like this the virtual card number is different from your actual card number so the merchant never sees your real card number in fact the merchant can not even tell that you are using a virtual card you can set the maximum amount to be charged you can set the expiration date from 2 to 12 months once the merchant has made a charge on that virtual card only that merchant can make any further charges on that same virtual card it is not possible to discover the real card number from the virtual card number so the result is that your risk is reduced to the merchant not delivering the order or charging too much but not over the limit you set there is nothing to be stolen since your real info never goes over the internet and once a merchant has used the virtual card once no other merchant can use it other banks may have virtual cards which have fewer features the only disadvantage of this is that you have to go to the bank 's website whenever you want to make a purchase from a new merchant but you do n't have to worry about them stealing your real credit card information

it might some but i 'd wager it pushes the short term rental pricing down like hotels while pushing the long term rental and housing market prices up     if landlords can make way more in short term rentals they are going to do that and limit the supply of long term   the tourism sector may have increased revenue but by what extent i do n't know   i 'd wager that exploding rent and housing prices will negate any benefits for most residents and may end up costing them much more   this is why i think you should only be able to do it on your primary residence   unless you want to be regulated like a hotel because if you have short term rentals that you do n't reside in that is effectively what you are   not being regulated the same as a hotel at that point only gives you an unfair loophole advantage to other short term rentals

guaranteed annual return sounds too good to be true am i    right are there likely high fees etc you 're right guaranteed annual return is impossible especially when you 're talking about investments for such a long period of time ponzi and madoff their investors using promises of guaranteed return see this note in wikipedia in some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even her financial advisor does n't charge by the hour he takes a    commission so there 's obviously some incentive to sell her things    even if she may not need them definitely not a good sign if the advisor gets a commission from the sale then he 's obviously not an advisor but a sales person the problem with this kind of investment is that it is very complex and it is very hard to track the commission to the broker makes it hard to evaluate returns you pay 10 upfront and it takes awhile to just get that money back before even getting any profits and since you 're only able to withdraw in 20 years or so there 's no real way to know if something wrong until you get there and discover that no money also many annuity funds if not all limit withdrawals to a long period i.e. you can not touch money for like 10 years from investment regardless of the tax issues the tax deferred investment can be rolled over to another tax deferred account but in this case you ca n't i suggest you getting your own financial advisor that will work for you to look over the details and talk to your mother if it is really a scam

i would steer well clear of this the risk is that they take your money but do n't pay the bank this would n't require dishonesty what if they run into financial trouble any money of yours that they have that has n't gone on to the bank yet might end up paying off other debts instead of yours it 's not clear if the idea is that you are paying them all the money up front or will be making payments over time but either way if they do n't clear the lien with the bank then the bank can come after the car no matter who is in physical possession of it that would leave you without either the money or the car in theory you 'd have a legal claim against the seller but in reality you 'd probably find it hard to collect

your relatively young age and the current very low bond interest rates make annuities a very poor buy and most of the other suggestions you have mentioned have very low diversification which exposes you to imprudent risks buying shares for dividend income can solve the diversification problem by averaging out your totals as different shares change by different amounts there is no really good solution to the problem of share price volatility except to ignore it take your dividends and pretty much ignore the bouncing around of the share price they usually recover in a year or three owning shares of companies that reliably increase their dividend payouts is the only investment type that gives you both diversification and regularly increasing income to counteract inflation over the years read some investment books and consider consulting with a financial advisor who charges a fee for the advice i.e. you do n't want free advice

in addition to what others have said i think it is important to consider that government retirement assistance whatever it is called in each instance is basically a promise that can be revoked i talked to a retired friend of mine just yesterday and we got onto that subject she mentioned that when she was young the promise was for 90 of one 's pay paid by the government after retiring it is very different today yes you can gamble that you wo n't need the saved money and thus decide not to save anything what then if you do end up needing the money you did not set aside but rather spent you are just now graduating college and assuming of course that you get a decently paying job are likely going to have loads more money than you are used to if you make an agreement with yourself to set aside even just 10 15 of the difference in income right from the start that is going to grow into a pretty sizable nest egg by the time you approach retirement age then you will have the option of continuing to work maybe part time or quitting in a way you would not have had otherwise now i 'm going to pull numbers out of thin air but suppose that you currently have $ 1000/month net before expenses and can get a job that pays $ net starting out 10 15 of the difference means you 'll be saving around $ 100/month for retirement in 35 years assuming no return on investment pessimistic but works if returns match inflation and no pay rises that will still be over $ that 's somewhere on the order of $ added to your retirement income for 25 years multiply with whatever inflation rate you think is likely if you prefer nominal values it becomes even more if you save a significant fraction of the additional pay if you save 1/3 of the additional money note that you still effectively get a 50 raise compared to what you have been living on before that gives you a net income of $ 1500/month instead of $ 1800 $ 500/month more rather than $ 800/month more which grows into about $ 110 k in 35 years assuming no return on investment nearly $ 400 per month for 25 years $ 100 per week is hardly chump change in retirement and it is still quite realistic for most people to save 30 of the money they did not have before

what you are describing does not sound like an investment it sounds like a loan an investment involves you putting up a stake and sharing in the profits or losses of the business there is no guarantee you will get your money back a loan involves you putting up money for which you will receive interest and principal repayment in accordance with an agreed schedule you get this irrespective of how the business is performing also is the arrangement with your friend or his company they are different legal entities and your risk profile is different in both cases whatever the arrangement you need to sign a contract which details all the terms and conditions how much you will pay to whom and when how much you will get back from whom and when a method for resolving disputes what happens in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy what happens if someone breaks the terms of the contract if your payout depends on the value of the business at some future date how it is to be valued etc etc two points i am not a lawyer i am not your lawyer

to be honest all that they might be able to tell you is to keep saving   your income seems like it will vary week to week thanks to commission and i 'm still very curious how at 18 you found a job making $ 96,000 a year at minimum   right now because you have no savings start stacking that up    you 're going to want an emergency fund on the side as well    even though now you may still live with parents you still may run into issues where you 'll need money on hand   it 's much better to dig into an emergency fund than get a loan   plus when moving out you wo n't be living paycheck to paycheck   best rule of thumb for this is to keep an emergency fund of roughly 3 6 months of expenses   right now because you 're so young with so little money there is n't a large reason to really open up an ira or any sort of investment account   unless you 're actually guaranteed $ 2,000 a week then things are different

you can not deduct commute expenses regarding your specific example something to consider is that if the standard of living is higher in san francisco presumably the wages are higher too therefore you must make a choice to trade time and some money for commuting costs for even more money in the form of higher wages for example if you can make $ 50 k working 2 hours away from sf or $ 80 k working in sf and it costs you $ 5 k extra per year in commute costs you still come out ahead by $ 25 k minus taxes if it ends up costing $ 20 k more to live in sf due to higher rent mortgage food etc some people choose to trade 4 extra hours of commuting time to put that extra $ 20 k in their pocket it 's sort of like having an extra part time job except you get paid to read watch tv sleep on the job assuming you can take a train to work

while one credit provider or credit reference agency might score you in one way others may score you differently including treating different things that contribute to your score differently different credit providers may also not see all of your credit score as potentially some data may not be available to all credit suppliers further too many searches may trigger systems that recognise behavior that is a sign of possible fraudulent activity such as applying for many items of credit in a short space of time whether this would directly affect a score or trigger manual checks is also likely to vary in situations like this a person could have applied for say a dozen credit cards with all the credit checks being performed before there is any credit history for any of those dozen cards

the simplest answer is that you can convert the ira to a roth and since it was already taxed pay no tax on conversion   if in your hypothetical situation you happen to have an ira already in place you are subject to pro rata rules on conversions e.g. your balance is total $ 40 k $ 10 k not deducted a conversion is 75 taxed convert $ 20 k and the tax is on $ 15 k of that money but there also might be a time when you are able to transfer ira money into a 401(k effectively removing the pretax deposits and leaving just post tax money for a free conversion

no the interest payments you receive do not change to help avoid confusion it is better to call those payments the coupons of the bond each treasury note or bond is issued with a certain coupon that remains fixed throughout its whole life however as the general level of bank interest rates change maybe because the fed is moving its deposit rate for banks the value of the treasury bond will change at maturity it will always be worth its face value but at any time before that its price will depend on the general level of interest rates in the country because of the way a bond is structured it is usually possible to convert the bond 's price into a yield which is usually a percentage like 3 or near the current level of general interest rates but do n't be confused this yield is just an alternative way of stating the current price of the treasury bond and it changes as the prices of the bond changes it is not the coupon that is changing but the yield
