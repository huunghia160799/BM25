i suggest to start charging slightly more than needed to cover expenses all you need is to show profit it does n't have to be significant a couple of hundred of dollars of consistent yearly profit should suffice to show a profitable business then you can deduct on schedule c all the related expenses the caveat is that the profit after the deduction of the expenses will be a bit smaller will be subject to not only income tax but also the self employment tax but at least you 'll pay tax on profit that is not entirely phantom i remember suggesting you getting a professional consultation on this matter a while ago you should really do that talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state it may be well worth the $ 100 200 fee they 'll charge for the consultation if at all

not sure why this has n't received any answers yet the link to the investopedia page you posted explains it pretty well however when you hear about a golden cross in the media it is most likely a reference to the sma crossing above the sma   in general a golden cross consists of a short term ma that was previously below a long term ma crossing above that lt ma however the most common reference will imply a day cross because this is considered as a stronger signal compared to shorter mas with that said it 's important to realize that the golden cross is just one of many technical analysis signals and the entire field of technical analysis is considered controversial to say the least   many studies such as those examined in a random walk down wall street have found that after transactions costs are considered e.g. the commissions you pay to your broker on every trade charting is a losing proposition in the end

if you have any non mortgage debt e.g. a credit card a line of credit a student loan or a car loan then i would pay that down first   the interest being paid on that kind of borrowed money likely exceeds what you could expect to earn in reasonable investments if you do n't have any non mortgage debt and your mortgage is large e.g. thinking about it keeps you up at night sometimes then go for the the extra mortgage payment   also go for the mortgage if you 're paying at a relatively high interest rate compared to what you could expect from investments if your mortgage is small e.g. it 's going to be paid off in a few years and at a relatively low interest rate then i would choose the rrsp or tfsa unless you 're in the top income tax bracket i would favor the tfsa over rrsp tfsas were only introduced this year and any balance there already is likely tiny compared to the rrsp for retirement i 'm aiming to have equal amounts of rrsp and tfsa money one option you have n't mentioned is an resp   if you have children under the age of 18 your bonus could also be used to make next year 's resp contribution and qualify for the 20 matching canada education savings grant cesg from the government

first i would be very careful using a short etf   there could be some serious tracking error especially if its levered   second when it comes to forex you are in the world of pips and high leverage   you would need to have significant capital to be able to hold out the swings as banks do their interventions   plenty of people have been short waiting and waiting and waiting unless you think you know something the market does n't this seems like a pretty high risk strategy   i 'd suggest buying options instead but they will be expensive given the volatility

gt no the main difference is dividends do n't take shares out of the marketplace to artificially inflate a quarters eps because buyback decreases shares outstanding it also decreases the company 's total future dividend payouts as well   you have no idea what you are talking about   buybacks are almost exclusively better for shareholders than dividends because they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   the fact that corporate buybacks have increased so much lately at the expense of dividends is a sign of good management by insiders

the advice to invest in yourself is good advice but the stock market can be very rewarding over the long pull you have about 45 years to retirement now and that is plenty long enough that each dollar put into the market now will be many dollars then a simple way to do this might be to open a brokerage account at a reputable broker and put a grand into a very broad based all market etf and then doing nothing with it the price of the etf will go up and down with the usual market gyrations but over the decades it will grow nicely make sure the etf has low fees so that you are n't being overcharged    it 's good that you are thinking about investing at a young age a rational and consistent investment strategy will lead to wealth over the long pull

thanks just to clarify i am looking for a more value neutral answer in terms of things like sharpe ratios i think it 's an oversimplification to say that on average you lose money because of put options even if they expire 90 of the time they still have some expected payoff that kicks in 10 of the time and if the price is less than the expected payoff you will earn money in the long term by investing in put options i am sure you know this as a phd student i just wanted to get it out guess more formally my question would be are there studies on whether options prices correspond well to the diversification benefits they offer from an mpt point of view

given you other question and your resulting marginal tax rate you may want to optimize where you hold each type of security   if you still plan to have a regular investment account it 's hard to beat the low tax rate of canadian dividends in a tfsa you wo n't pay tax on the dividend income and you wo n't get a dividend tax credit either   for some people in bc this actually costs them money as they have negative marginal dividend tax rates   for you it seems to be 6 contrast this with any other holding in your regular account interest at full marginal rates and cap gains at half that   dividends still win in a regular account

the issue is online stores driving prices down and that drives down revenue and more importantly profit   the most effective way to cut costs is to cut wages and that leaves uneducated and under qualified employees at a retail establishment    the business model simply can not be sustained    walmart has it right   leave everything to the consumer to decide and neglect to give them assistance   until a sales associate earns more than their wage in profit they are losing the company money assuming their only job is to sell   electronics sales has very little profit outside of the extra items such as cables cases protection plans etc so they really have to be a professional sales associate to be valuable   professionals cost money and become the managers or more which brings us back to the uneducated and under qualified associates that walk the floors

my question is how do you rebuild a home without the money to rebuild the home i thought that was why we paid for insurance the reason that you have insurance is so as to keep the mortgage lender from losing money   that 's why you buy the insurance through the mortgage lender and they get paid   without the insurance you 'd have no home but still have a mortgage   you 'd either have to pay off a mortgage with no house or have to declare bankruptcy to shed the mortgage    you essentially have two paths   if you or the builder suppliers can afford to float the cost you can rebuild the original house   you 'll eventually get the $ and can pay off the builder and suppliers   this may involve taking out a construction mortgage to refinance the original mortgage   presumably the construction mortgage would be with a different lender    the other path is that you can sell the existing property as is and use the insurance and proceeds to pay off the existing mortgage   then you 'd have no house and no mortgage   you start over and buy a house with a mortgage    it 's possible that your insurance payoff is n't enough to pursue either path   then your option is to get the insurer to make a bigger payoff   this may involve suing them   note that you may be able to talk the government into suing the insurer for you   they do have regulators who can review things   if you ca n't get government action there are lawyers who will do the suing and take their fees out of their winnings

yes simply put printing money is called monetizing the debt and would result in some nasty inflation it 's a no no as it quickly devalues the currency and makes it far more difficult to borrow in the future an entire generation will remember getting burned by it if say canada 's currency were suddenly worth half as much and you received half your investment back in us dollars e.g. you paid us$ 10,000 but now have us$ 5000 would you ever trust them again   the economy is far more complex than one can discuss here but the fractional reserve system is the next creator of money although it 's not unlimited the reserve requirement it back the demand for loans is impacted both by the rate itself and the bank 's willingness to lend   the housing bubble had multiple causes in a sense is right anything we do to make houses more affordable can cause house price inflation but the over the top underwriting had more impact in my opinion people lost sight of good lending practices the option rate interest only arms were financial time bombs

no in the uk you do n't need to pay tax on gifts in general in theory there could be an inheritance tax issue but it 's highly unlikely to apply here it could only apply at all if all of the below apply but even then the allowance would probably count as a regular gift out of income and so would be ignored completely regular gifts from the giver ’s income there ’s no inheritance tax on gifts from the deceased ’s income after    they paid tax as long as the deceased had enough money to maintain    their normal lifestyle

wow hard to believe not a single answer mentioned investing in one of the best asset classes for tax purposes real estate   now i 'm not advising you to rush out and buy an investment property   but rather than just dumping your money into mutual funds over which you have almost 0 control buy some books on real estate investing   there are plenty of areas to get into single family housing rentals multifamily apartments mobile home parks and even some of those can have their own   learn now and yes you do have some control over real estate you control where you buy so you pick your local market you can always force appreciation by if you rent you approve your renters   compared to a mutual fund run by someone you 'll never meet buying stocks in companies you 've likely never even heard of you have far more control no matter what area of investing you decide to go into there is a learning curve or you will pay a penalty   go slow but move forward also all the advice on using your employer 's matching if available for 401k should be the easiest first step   how do you turn down free money   besides the bottom line on your paycheck may not change as much as you think it might and when weighed against what you get in return well worth the time to get it setup and active

another thing to consider however is the deductibility of business expenses   let 's assume that the employer can legitimately hire you as a 1099 contractor   would you be able to would you have a high degree of control over when you worked and when you did n't   these factors also affect whether you 're a true independent 1099 contractor or not   as a legit 1099 contractor you 're able to deduct certain business expenses directly from your income you can find a list of the rules at irs.gov   as a w2 employee by contrast can deduct only business expenses that exceed 2 of the your agi adjusted gross income   so you also have to consider your personal circumstances in making the calculus and comparing whether a legitimate 1099 contractor job is or is not good for you   it 's not just a comparison of what they 'd pay w2 employees versus what they 'd pay 1099 contractors

the two terms seem to be used interchangeably   even the irs website uses them interchangeably from one sentence to the next emphasis mine many 401(k plans allow employees to make a hardship withdrawal    because of immediate and heavy financial needs generally hardship    distributions from a 401(k plan are limited to the amount of the    employees elective contributions only it might a difference in perspective   the account holder withdraws the money but the fund manager distributes it another way to look at it would be for cases that are only in transition to another tax advantaged account   you can withdraw the money without it becoming a taxable distribution if you get it into another tax advantaged account within a certain time limit

everyone has made some good points that i was going to mention but to put it in terms that might make it easier to decide as stated by others paying off debt and being free is always the goal and desirable however you must also consider the efficiency of what you do as well for example there are two common types of student loans there are others but let 's focus on these and that is subsidized and unsubsidized the main difference subsidized loans do n't earn interest on your balance while you are in school it only happens when you graduate and come out of repayment grace period unsubsidized loans begin accumulating interest the moment they are disbursed but you are not required to make payments on them until you graduate all student loans are deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period or other means of deferring your payment say for example a or forbearance however it is often recommended that on unsubsidized loans you pay down your principle while still in school to avoid that massive interest amount that will get added to it when you are officially in repayment on the other hand it is often if not always recommended that you hold off on paying subsidized loans until you are done and go into repayment as for all intents and purposes its not costing you anything extra to wait family and parent loans are considered and treated more like personal loans so treat them as such hope that helps also do n't forget to take advantage of the income based repayment options as they will make the payments manageable enough to avoid making them a burden while you are trying to get a job and go post education further reading   income driven plans department of education income driven repayment plans

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

i know that for me personally if i buy that giant box of instead of the bags it does n't mean i 'm saving money just eating a lot more   the trick i think to buying in bulk is to make sure that you 're not consuming in bulk   you 're not likely to go through more dishwasher detergent just because you bought the big bottle but you may find the kids are eating a lot more fruit snacks or you 're throwing away half of that huge bag of baby carrots that went bad because you bought in bulk

ugh sorry + finance is pretty to actual information sharing   taxi medallions licenses are heavily financed using debt principally in the form of commercial loans the structure of these loans is usually interest only 3 year balloon with borrowers qualified on a 40 year amortization period sound familiar i 'll give you a hint rhymes with the loans then get chopped up and to local community lenders who are told that the prices never go down because supply side monopoly and then they happily up the concentration of taxi financing in their lending portfolios   your observation is uber lyft sidecar all that shit comes into the picture and there 's no hail so they 're not really taxis meaning they skirt regulation and to make matters worse they are also heavily financed through vc pe short term bank debt and they use that financing to do what not operations instead they just lower their prices and usually below that of traditional cabs it 's an artificially deflated price designed to hook folks on the service and then when they start not being able to subsidize their prices anymore they 'll raise em back up but consumers do n't care about that in the short run   why does any of this matter because when the e collective cited above comes in and creates stiff competition demand for medallion falls because cab drivers would rather go work for uber they do n't need to license their right to drive from a cab fleet anymore and also demand for cabs themselves falls because people would rather take the cheaper alternative that causes the cost of medallions to fall which = price correction and that 's bad because it 's not the guys originating and these loans who are on the hook effectively sold off their share of the loan to other lenders community banks and cashed out instead you 're looking at mom and pop banks who are now on the hook for these loans where the value of the loan grossly exceeds the value of the collateral the medallion the thing they were supposed to partially finance   this is the same phenomenon as what happened in 08 real estate prices experience a substantial price correction because of well a bunch of shit but let 's just say that it had to do with the financing arrangements that made real estate safe in the first place + shitty loan underwriting standards all of a sudden you had people with 500 k houses that they took out a 1.2 m mortgage for rational actors true to their word just walked away from the house just packed up their shit and moved somewhere else and just said to the bank here 's the keys i ca n't afford this shit and the bank ca n't take any of their stuff because the mortgage terms were essentially for the value of the collateral so now you have all these banks that are short on liquid assets they have residential properties but nobody 's buying at least not at the prices that they need to get the return on their investment   this is all a really long way of saying this if there is a mass price correction caused by uber it 's going to be mom and pop banks on the hook for the loans borrowers will flee en masse to uber et al while banks will experience serious liquidity issues you 're right that uber is doing something great by forcing taxi cabs into a non monopolistic situation but the first step needs to be unwinding the debt on these loans otherwise you 're looking at a mini market crash that could be disastrous for grandma and grandpa in county they 're not going and banking at citi or they 're banking at shitty little mom and pop banks that have no idea what they 're being sold

i agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan it may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money   i know of one called lending club disclaimer i 'm an investor on this platform not trying to advertise it 's just the only place i know of off the top of my head that facilitates loans like this but instead of a bank financing the loan the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount such as $ 25 they have rates anywhere between 5 30 based on your credit and i believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you 're discussing   regarding buying the house the best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20 downpayment if at all possible below this amount you may be asked to pay for pmi private mortgage insurance this is a charge that does n't go away for quite a while until you 've paid them 20 of the appraised value of the home where you pay a premium because you did n't have the 20 downpayment for the house   i would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible and would recommend the same for your father getting your utilization down and the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable fixed payment   whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you if it were me personally i 'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time but if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your tax free savings account it may not be a beneficial situation   treat debt especially credit card debt like an emergency at all times and you 'll find yourself in a better place as a result   credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary and their rates and fees are structured that way if for any reason you expect that a credit card 's balance will remain for an extended period of time you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan instead

the stock market is not a zero sum game   some parts are forex some option trading but plain old stock trading is not zero sum that is to say if you were to invest at random you would on average make money   that 's because the market as a whole makes money it goes up over time 6 10 annually averaged over time   that 's because you 're not just gambling when you buy a stock you 're actually contributing money to a company directly or indirectly which it uses to fund activities that on average make money   when you buy caterpillar stock you 're indirectly funding caterpillar building tractors which they then sell for a profit and thus your stock appreciates in value   while not every company makes a profit and thus not every stock appreciates in true value the average one does to some extent buying index funds is pretty close to investing at random   it has a far lower risk of course since you 're not buying a few stocks at random but instead are buying all stocks in an index but buying stocks from the s&p 500 at random would on average give the same return as voo with way more volatility so for one you definitely could do worse than 50/50 if you simply sold the market short sold random stocks short you would lose money over time on average above and beyond the transaction cost since the market will go up over time on average secondly there is the consideration of limited and unlimited gains or losses some trades specifically some option trades have limited potential gains and unlimited potential losses take for example a simple call option   if you sell a naked call option meaning you sell a call option but do n't own the stock for $ 100 at a strike price of $ 20 for 100 shares you make money as long as the price of that stock is under $ 21   you have a potential to make $ 100 because that 's what you sold it for if the price is under $ 20 it 's not exercised and you just get that $ 100 free    but on the other hand if the stock goes up you could potentially be out any amount of money   if the stock trades at $ 24 you 're out $ 400 100 = $ 300 right   plus transaction costs    but what if it trades at $ 60   or $ 100   or $ 10000   you 're still out 100 that amount so in the latter case $ 1 million   it 's not likely to trade at that point but it could if you were to trade at random you 'd probably run into one of those types of situations   that 's because there are lots of potential trades out there that nobody expects anyone to take but that does n't mean that people would n't be happy to take your money if you offered it to them    that 's the reason your vs argument is faulty   you 're absolutely right that if there were a consistently losing line that the consistently winning line would exist but that requires someone that is willing to take the losing line   trades require two actors one on each side if you 're willing to be the there 's always someone happy to take advantage of you but you might not get a

that makes no sense at all they try to compare and that 's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges mortgage is long term loan so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20 or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower something around 6 heloc will have the interest rate of 6 but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage the bottom line is if helocs were that great noone would apply for mortgages you should stick to making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage

your calculations are correct it is likely that the bank 's software has a rounding error   in effect either your bank is overstating your interest by eight cents per month or your bank is insisting that you prepay your principal by eight cents per month   if the bank 's ongoing interest calculations are correct your final payment will be slightly smaller because of the prepaid principal and because of compound interest on those prepayments   i have performed similar calculations for my mortgages over the years and except upon early payoff in the middle of the month i have always matched my banks calculations to the penny   ironically this means that my banks formulas are a bit weird after making these adjustments even my calculations for the mid month payoff matched to the penny

i 'm guessing since i do n't know the term but it sounds like you 're asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single up front transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though you 're giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanity check it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a payments processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need   i 've done this in my case it cost me a bit under $ 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers family loan   will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and ca n't do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni

will buying a flat which generates $ 250 rent per month be a good decision whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things including the current and future supply demand for rental units in your particular area there are many questions on this site about this topic and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider i just want to focus on this point you raised i personally think yes because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it in my opinion the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk not an absolute increase in value first consider buying a house to live in instead of to rent   if you pay off your mortgage before your retire then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities property taxes and repairs this gives you a relatively known fixed requirement of cash outflows if the value of property goes up by the time you retire it does n't cost you anything extra because you already own your house if the value of property goes down by the time you retire then you do n't save anything because you already own your house if you instead rent your whole life and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage then when you retire you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month by the time you retire your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time if the value of property goes up by the time you retire you will have to pay more on rent if the value of property goes down by the time you retire you will save money on rent you will have larger savings but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain because you do n't know what the market price for rent will be you can see that because you need to put a roof over your own head just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising so buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk this is called a natural hedge where two competing risks can mitigate each other just by existing this does n't mean buying a house is always the right thing to do it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site or on google now consider buying a house to rent out to other people   in the extreme scenario assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible maybe by the time you retire you own a small apartment building with 11 units where you live in one of them as an example and you have no other savings before owning your own home was among other pros and cons a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up but now the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations that is if rent goes up by $ 100 after you retire your rental income goes up by $ 1,000 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by $ 100 if rent goes down by $ 50 after you retire your rental income goes down by $ 500 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by $ 50 you can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market this risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home because at least in that case you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations which you know you will need to pay one way or another this is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio that means buying some stocks some bonds etc if you invest to heavily in a single thing then you bear huge risks for that particular market in the case of property each investment is so large that you are often if you invest heavily in it you ca n't just buy a house $ 100 at a time like you could a stock or bond of course my above examples are very simplified i am only trying to suggest the underlying principle not the full complexities of the real estate market note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation cost of living real estate is only one of them

on paper the whole 6 months living costs sounds and is great but in real life there are a lot of things that you need to consider for example my first car was constantly falling apart and was an suv that got i have to travel for work about 300 miles per week so getting a sedan that averages close to saves me more in gas and maintenance than the monthly payment for the new car costs when our apartment lease was up the new monthly rent would have been $ per month we got a 30 year mortgage with a monthly payment of $ so buying a house actually let us put aside more each month we have just under 3 months of living expenses set aside 1 month in liquid assets 2 months in a brokerage account and i worry about it i wish we had a better buffer but in our case the house and car made more sense as an early investment compared to just away all our savings also do you have any debt paying off debt student loans credit card debt etc should often take top priority have some rainy day funds of course but pay down debts and then create a personal financial plan for what works best in your situation that would be my suggestion

futures are an agreement to buy or sell something in the future   the futures price is the price at which you agree to make the trade   this price does not indicate what will happen in the future so much as it indicates the cost of buying the item today and holding it until the future date   hence for very liquid products such as stock index futures the futures price is a very simple function of today 's stock index value and current short term interest rates   if the stock exchange is closed but the futures exchange is open then using the futures price and interest rates one can back out an implied fair value for the index which is in essence the market 's estimate of what the stock index value would be right now if the stock market were open   of course as soon as the stock exchange opens the futures price trades to within a narrow band of the actual index value where the size of the band depends on transaction costs bid ask spread commissions etc

so i did some queries on google scholar and the term of art academics seem to use is target date fund i notice divided opinions among academics on the matter w. gave a nice set of citations of papers with which he disagrees so i 'll start with them in 1969 paul published the paper lifetime portfolio selection by dynamic programming which found that there 's no mathematical foundation for an age based risk tolerance there seems to be a fundamental quibble relating to present value of future wages if they are stable and uncorrelated with the market one analysis suggests the optimal lifecycle investment should start at roughly 300 percent of your portfolio in stocks via crazy borrowing other people point out that if your wages are correlated with stock returns allocations to stock as low as 20 percent might be optimal so theory is n't helping much perhaps with the advent of computers we can find some kind of empirical data robert shiller authored a study on lifecycle funds when they were proposed for personal social security accounts lifecycle strategies fare poorly in his historical simulation moreover with these life cycle portfolios relatively little is contributed when the allocation to stocks is high since earnings are relatively low in the younger years workers contribute only a little to stocks and do not enjoy a strong effect of    compounding since the proceeds of the early investments are taken out of the stock    market as time goes on and drew follow up on that assertion with a set of lifecycle strategies and their contrarian counterparts whereas a the lifecycle plan starts high stock exposure and trails off near retirement the contrarian ones will invest in bonds and cash early in life and move to stocks after a few years they show that contrarian strategies have higher average returns even at the low 25th percentile of returns it 's only at the bottom 5 or 10 percent where this is reversed one problem with these empirical studies is isolating the effect of the glide path from rebalancing it could be that a simple fixed allocation works plenty fine and that selling winners and doubling down on losers is the fundamental driver of returns and compare lifecycle strategy with a number of fixed asset allocation schemes in monte carlo simulations and conclude that a 70 equity 30 long term corp bonds does as well as all of the lifecycle funds finally the earlier w paper offers a monte carlo simulation similar to and and runs final portfolio values through a utility function designed to calculate diminishing returns to more money this seems like a good point as the risk of your portfolio is n't all or nothing but your first dollar is more valuable than your finds that for some risk aversion coefficients offer greater utility than portfolios with fixed allocations and does note that applying their strategies to the historical record makes a strong recommendation for 100 percent stocks in all but 5 years from 1940 2011 so maybe the best retirement allocation is good old low cost s&p index funds

the original note should have had a a clear start and expiration date included with in it the term   if it did then the term has likely expired by now since you said it had been years and you should issue an amendment to the note that clarifies the new term and also clarifies the interest rate terms   if the original note did not have an expiration date then that would be unusual and your mom should work with her friend to execute a new note with clear start and expiration dates and that also clarifies the payment and interest terms   from my experience it is best to include a specific payment schedule within the note as well as very specific and clear terms around how interest will be handled in the event of a missed payment late payment or inability to pay the note off in full at expiration   there are many good examples available online to help you craft the appropriate verbiage for your specific needs

elliott was arguing from the position of an original creditor   they still had the same rights and obligations as if they bought the bond directly from the government   so buying the bonds at a huge discount did not mean that they gave up rights under the law   would your opinion differ if it was the original bondholders in the lawsuit and not these vulture funds   think of it this way elliott paid less because the original bondholders rights were judged by the market to be unlikely to result in being paid in full   but paying less did not extinguish any of the original bondholders rights    and anytime a bond holder is forced to accept modified terms that they did not agree to the borrower is unilaterally changing the terms   there is an argument that this is necessary for businesses and individuals but sovereigns that can raise revenue as a matter of policy have no excuse

as a tl;dr version of jaganalyst 's excellent answer the buying company does n't need every last share all they need is to get 51 of the voting bloc to agree to the merger and to vote that way at a shareholder meeting or if they can get a 90 in the us they do n't even need a vote usually a buying company 's first option is a friendly merger they approach the board of directors or the direct owners of a private company and make a tender offer to buy the company by purchasing their controlling interest the board if they find the offer attractive enough will agree and usually their support or the outright sale of shares will get the company the 51 they need failing the first option the buying company 's next strategy is to make the same tender offer on the open market this must be a public declaration and there must be time for the market to absorb the news before the company can begin purchasing shares on the open market the goal is to acquire 51 of the total shares in existence not 51 of market cap that 's the number or value of shares offered for public trading you could buy 100 of facebook 's market cap and not be anywhere close to a majority holding zuckerberg himself owns 51 of the company and other vcs still have closely held shares not available for public trading that means that a company that does n't have 51 of its shares on the open market is pretty much un without getting at least some of those private shareholders to cash out but that 's actually pretty rare some of your larger multinationals may have as little as 10 of their equity in the hands of the upper management who would be trying to resist such a takeover at this point the company being bought is probably treating this as a hostile takeover they have options such as however for companies that are at risk of a takeover unless management still controls enough of the company that an public stockholder decision would have to be unanimous the shareholder voting body will often reject efforts to activate these measures because the takeover is often viewed as a good thing for them if the company 's vulnerable that 's usually because it has under performing profits or losses which depresses its stock prices and the buying company will typically make a tender offer well above the current stock value should the buying company succeed in approving the merger any holdouts who did not want the merger to occur and did not sell their stock are squeezed out their shares are forcibly purchased at the tender price or exchanged for equivalent stock in the buying company nobody deals in paper certificates anymore and as of the dissolution of the purchased company 's such certs would be worthless and they either move forward as shareholders in the new company or take their cash and go home

of course credit cards are viewed as credit if you 're using money on a credit card you are not directly paying for your transactions on goods services immediately this is the act of borrowing credit to pay for them debit cards on the other hand work where the funds are taken from an account immediately or subject to a small delay but usually no more than 24 hours depending on various factors you should never miss credit card payments as that will affect your credit rating if you have unpaid money on your card this is debt plain and simple but to answer your question succinctly yes credit cards are a form of credit as the name suggests when you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit debt is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts the level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt this is how it works in the uk but to my knowledge it is the same in the us and most other countries please clarify if you think this is incorrect

when it comes down to it long term investments pay better than short term ones   if nothing else there 's less administration and less financial risk for the provider   that 's why 2 3 or 5 year savings accounts pay better than instant access ones higher risk investments pay more interest or dividends than low risk ones   they have to or nobody would invest in them so by locking yourself out of any long term and/or risky investments you 're stuck with a choice of low interest short term ones there are plenty of investment funds that you can sell at short notice if you want to   but they are volatile and if you cash out at the wrong time you can get back less than you invested   the way you lower risk is either to invest in a fund that covers a broad range of investments or invest in several different funds

buying a house may save you money compared with renting depending on the area and specifics of the transaction including the purchase price interest rates comparable rent etc in addition buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals in a community ability to renovate pride of ownership etc these factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions however there is one other way i think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership buying a house provides you with a natural hedge against possible future changes in your cost of living assume the following if these two items are true then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly fixed as long as you live in that community in 2 years if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket does n't affect you your mortgage payment or if you paid cash the lack of mortgage payment is fixed in 3 years if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet does n't affect you your mortgage payment is fixed if you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed other costs of home ownership will be variable see below you may or may not save money compared with rent over the period you live in your house but by putting your money into a house you have protected yourself against catastrophic rent increases what is the cost of hedging yourself against this risk a the known costs of ownership closing costs on purchase mortgage interest property tax condo fees home insurance etc b the unknown costs of ownership annual and periodic maintenance closing costs on a future sale etc c the potential earnings lost on your down payment mortgage principal payments whether it is low risk interest or higher risk equity d you may have reduced savings for a long period of time which would limit your ability to cover emergencies such as medical costs unexpected unemployment etc e you may have a reduced ability to look for a better job based on being locked into a particular location though i have assumed above that you want to live in a particular community for an extended period of time that desire may change and f you ca n't reap the benefits of a rental market that decreases in real dollars if that happens in your market over time in short purchasing a home should be a lifestyle motivated decision it financially reduces some the fluctuation in your long term living costs with the trade off of committed principal dollars and additional ownership risks including limited mobility

if money is more expensive costs more to borrow then fewer people will be able to qualify to make the payments for a particular size of mortgage   this reduces the number of potential buyers for property at that price   as sellers still want to sell they will move their prices down to where more people can afford to buy so rising interest rates create downward pressure on housing prices but toronto is the biggest city in canada   i 'd expect part of the high prices there is the location lots of people want to be close to lots of activities action and opportunity   unless something catastrophic happens i do n't see toronto losing that advantage   if anything it 's going to get a tad warmer up there in the coming decades

divided by hours worked or even effort for that matter ignores economies of scale   no not at all let 's go back to    when more units of a good or a service can be produced on a larger scale yet with on average less variable input costs   economies of scale are said to be achieved   the good produced in our comparison is salary   the variable input costs are hours worked the fixed costs are an annual time period ie it takes them both one year to produce their annual salary output regardless   we have two guys one is making 100k annually working 5 hours a week the other makes 500k working 80 hours per week   they both have a the same fixed costs of time period of a year    if we plot them both on a graph you 're correct the 500k salary output is a larger output but at much greater variable costs efficiency is lost by the guy working 80 hour weeks   the guy getting 100k for 5 hour weeks is optimizing his variable costs much more effectively   sure he could make more but would suffer diminishing returns on his output     dude above claims that you 're not successful unless you make 500k   i was just illustrating that success can be defined outside of straight compensation

while the other answers are good i wanted to expand a little on why i feel a roth is a bad way to go unless you are young first let 's pretend you have a 25 tax rate and your investments will go up 5 per year for 10 years you contribute 6 of income for one year you can do a traditional or a roth 401k ira here 's the math traditional 6 of income invested grows at 5 for 10 years taxed at 25 on withdrawl = income 6 1.05 ^ 10 100 25 = income 6 .75 = of your original income but this is after taxes roth taxes taken out of income then 6 of that goes into the fund(s still grows at 5 for 10 years not taxed at withdrawl = income 100 25 6 1.05 ^ 10 = income 75 6 = of your original income again this is after taxes look familiar they are the same it 's the simple property of mathematics so why do a traditional vs. a roth the reason is that your tax bracket changes this changes because your income changes say when you retire you plan to have your home or vehicle paid for you expect to be able to live on $ 50,000 per year this means when you make more than $ 50,000 you should do a traditional plan and when you make less than this you should do a roth plan example you make $ 100,000 and your upper bracket is now 30 you save 30 by doing a traditional and then pay back 10 20 and 30 as you withdraw a salary of $ 50,000 traditional = better example you make $ 30,000 annually your upper bracket is 20 you pay 20 on a roth then you withdraw funds to get to $ 50,000 and never pay the higher bracket roth = better roth advocates typically bring up tax rates of course they will go up they insist so you always should do a roth not so fast taxes have gone down in recent years no one please start a political debate with me some went up some went down but overall federal income rates dropped even if taxes rose 5 a traditional will still be better than a roth in many cases

you should ask your employer to issue an updated payslip showing the correct gross salary deductions and net salary and then repay to the employer the difference between the net salary in your old wrong pay slip and the new correct one you should also get them to confirm that they have corrected any information they sent hmrc at the end of the tax year when you get a showing your salary for the year make sure that it is consistent with the corrected salary amount and check that the tax it shows as being deducted is also correct for that gross salary for the year if you are still employed by them then you could just ask them to withhold the overpayment in your next salary payment at which point the income tax would sort itself out because paye is calculated based on cumulative totals if the overpayment had happened at the end of the tax year march then there 'd be some risk of it messing up your tax payments in some cases it 's also possible that withholding from the next salary payment could make a difference to the total national insurance you end up paying broadly if you earn below the primary threshold of £ you might lose out if you earn close to the upper earnings limit of £ you could end up gaining

a credit card is basically a revolving loan in which you 're allowed to borrow up to a certain amount the limit and any time you borrow you pay interest   if you were to borrow $ 100 to pay for something via a credit card you 'd have a $ 100 balance on the card if you then pay $ 70 cash to the card there would be $ 30 remaining   that $ 30 balance could accrue interest the timing of that interest charge could vary the 20 you 've quoted is almost certainly apr of which the a stands for annual so that 20 would be an annual rate   it makes the most sense mind you to keep a minimal balance on a credit card as the interest rate is higher than most other loans

the dividend tax credit is not applicable to foreign dividend income so you would be taxed fully on every dollar of that income when you sell a stock there will be a capital gain or capital loss depending on if it gained or lost value after accounting for the adjusted cost base you only pay income tax on half of the amount earned through capital gains and if you have losses you can use them to offset other investments that had capital gains or carry forward to offset gains in the future   the dividends from us stocks are subject to a 15 withholding tax that gets paid to the irs automatically when the dividends are issued if the stocks are held in an rrsp they are exempt from the withholding tax if held in a non registered account you can be reimbursed for the tax by claiming the foreign tax credit that you linked to if held in a tfsa or resp the withholding tax can not be recovered also if you are not directly holding the stocks and instead buy a mutual fund or etf that directly holds the stocks then the rrsp exemption no longer applies but the foreign tax credit is still for a non registered account if the mutual fund or etf does not directly hold stocks and instead holds one or more etfs there is no way to recover the withholding tax in any type of account

i ca n't give you a specific answer because i 'm not a tax accountant so you should seek advice from a tax professional with experience relevant to your situation this could be a complicated situation that being said one place you could start is the canada revenue agency 's statement on investment income which contains this paragraph interest foreign interest and dividend income foreign income    foreign non business income and certain other income are all amounts    you report on your return they are usually shown on the following    slips to avoid double taxation canada and the us almost certainly have a foreign tax treaty that ensures you are only taxed in your country of residence i 'm assuming you 're a resident of canada also this page states that if you received foreign interest or dividend income you have to    report it in canadian dollars use the bank of canada exchange rate    that was in effect on the day you received the income if you received    the income at different times during the year use the average annual    exchange rate you should consult a tax professional i 'm not a tax professional let alone one who specializes in the canadian tax system a professional is the only one you should trust to answer your question with 100 accuracy

i would like to add to the answer provided by dheer i think under some you need not pay premium after 3 years and you can take the money back after 5 years something like that read your policy statement of course since the money is invested in stock markets and since generally people say the longer money stays in stocks the better you can keep the money with them without taking it back and without paying any further premium that way whatever you paid will be invested and you can get it back later when you feel you will make a profit

let 's say that you want to invest in the stock market   choosing and investing in only one stock is risky   you can lower your risk by diversifying or investing in lots of different stocks   however you have some problems with this   when you buy stocks directly you have to buy whole shares and you do n't have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in you are n't even sure which stocks you should buy a mutual fund solves both of these problems   you get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks   that way your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one   and the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in so you do n't have to pick there are lots of mutual funds to choose from with as many different objectives as you can imagine   some invest in large companies others small some invest in a certain sector of companies utilities or health care for example some invest in stocks that pay a dividend others are focused on growth   some funds do n't invest in stocks at all they might invest in bonds real estate or precious metals   some funds are actively managed where the manager actively buys and sells different stocks in the fund continuously and takes a fee for his services and others simply invest in a list of stocks and rarely buy or sell these are called index funds to answer your question yes the jpmorgan emerging markets equity fund is a mutual fund   it is an actively managed stock mutual fund that attempts to invest in growing companies that do business in countries with rapidly developing economies

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online

if we 're including psychological considerations then the question becomes much more complicated will having a higher available credit increase the temptation to spend will eliminating 100 of a small debt provide more positive reinforcement than paying off 15 of a larger debt etc if we 're looking at the pure financial impact the question is simpler the only advantage i see to prioritizing the lower interest card is the float when you buy something on a credit card interest is often calculated for that purchase starting at the beginning of the next billing cycle rather than immediately from the purchase date i 'm not clear on what policies credit card companies have on giving float for credit cards with a carried balance so you should look into what your card 's policy is   other than than paying off the higher interest rate card is better than paying off the lower interest rate on top of that you should look into whether you qualify for any of the following options presented from best to worst

ah but that 's not how the game is played there are no free lunches but there are lunches that are free or mostly free to individuals as someone on the receiving end of a pension your only objective is to lock in the highest average payout the cost of that will be borne by shareholders and customers of the business so a higher number is always better right up to the point that the company folds and because of the pbgc there is a discount on the risk of the company being dragged under by its pension costs even if the company goes under the pensioners still probably get something*. likewise it 's in a company 's best interest to pensions as much as possible paying pensions from free cash flow keeps the least dollars tied up in poor investments leaving the company the most room to manage its assets efficiently likewise corporate bosses also know that they can be aggressive with   pension promises because they are allowed to under fund those liabilities it 's a taxpayer backed just because taxpayers are n't paying up front does n't mean they are n't the lender of last resort that 's just a political reality there 's no waiting to bail my ass out if the market crashes

you need to protect from two types of disasters you need to set a goal in 5 years i will have x months of emergency funds then start building it you can also make sure that any found money birthday check from your grandmother or bonus check at work goes into building the fund   while is seems a waste to pay all that interest for the student loans you may decide that having an emergency fund is more important note do n't mix the two types of emergency funds it is less confusing to have two sub accounts because it avoids the double counting of the funds

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

nothing can be done well in the past the courts were the mechanism by which something was done and that something was called consent decree where the court would simply order the monopolistic practices to stop immediately or the offenders could instead pay for instance a million dollar per day fine until they came into compliance xerox for instance only opened the specs of what we now call the pc under a court ordered consent decree    this nationwide system of trust busting was dismantled under reagan with the creation of the court of appeals of the federal circuit which was created out of nothing   in order to strengthen so called intellectual property rights the term intellectual property in turn had been crafted by a group of patent lawyers decades earlier in order to promote monopolistic practices    things could go back to the way they were with a major of the court system but as in the 30s it will probably take a sustained economic depression and complete collapse of the stock market to make that happen with mechanisms like the 401 k which also emerged in the reagan era that becomes more and more difficult to achieve without enormous suffering and loss of wealth by typical households

first of all debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine from borrowers point of view debt is good when it increases overall economic utility   a young person wants to bring up a family but can not afford the house had they waited for 30 years they would have reached the level of income and savings to buy the house for cash by the time it might be too late to raise a family sure they 'd enjoy the house for the last 20 years of their life but they would loose 30 years of utility they could have enjoyed the house for 50 years so for a reasonable fee they can bring the spending forward   another young person might want to enjoy a life of luxury using the magical debt time machine and bringing forward their future earnings they might spend 10 years worth of future earnings on entertainment within a year and have a blast due to the law of diminishing marginal utility all that utility is pretty much wasted but they 'll still will need to make sacrifices in the future the trick is to roughly match the period of debt repayment to the economic life of the purchase buying a house means paying over 30 years for an asset that has an economic life of 80 given that the interest fee is reasonable and the house wo n't loose it 's value overnight that 's a good debt buying a used car with a remaining life of 5 years and financing its with a seven years loan is not a good idea buying a luxurious holiday that lasts a fortnight with 2 years of repayments i.e. financing non essential short term need with medium term debt is insane the other question is could the required utility be achieved through a substitute at a lower cost without having to bring the spending forward or paying the associated fee

note specific to uk i ca n't recommend anything higher than crunch they act as your accountant and have their own cloud accounting software so it 's more expensive than just using cloud accounting software but if you use an accountant to do your year end anyway then they cost about the same as using cloud accounting software plus using an accountant to do your year end the thing i like as a software development contractor is that i do n't have to know or worry about different ledger accounts or journal entries or any of the other weird accounting things etc most cloud accounting software claim to simplify accounting so that you can concentrate on running your business whereas the reality is that you still have to spend ages learning how to be an accountant just to fill it in correctly with crunch that 's actually true it does actually make it simple i 've used crunch sage and xero so my sample set is n't very big just thought i 'd share my experiences if you value your time and get annoyed by having to create multiple internal transfers between different ledgers just to do something simple it 's for you this probably sounds like a sales pitch but i have nothing to do with them and nothing to gain by recommending them the only reason i 'm so passionate is i started a new business to do an online shop and tried to use crunch but they do n't do retail businesses only contractors freelancers or simple service based businesses their software is geared up specifically for that which i guess is why it 's more simple than the others anyway so now i 'm annoyed at having to use the more complicated ones

i 'd suggest buying a used car for cash car loans are a bad idea i bought my last car a few years ago for $ 8k off of craigslist and it is still running great make sure you get a car checked out by a mechanic before buying usually they 'll drop it off at a mechanic you want to have take a look or perhaps just go with you my general rule is to not take out loans for anything which decreases in value so a home mortgage would be fine a car loan is not a great plan buy cash and save for the next purchase if you buy a decent used corolla or other small import car you can get it for $ 8k it will likely last a few years at least that could end up costing you less than $ 200 per month total or less much better deal in the long run

loan officer here yes you pay the per diem i 'd recommend not paying it off for like 6 months you can pay it down to basically nothing and then hold it for six months and pay it off better for credit if it 's a simple interest rate most car loans are multiply the current principal balance by the interest rate and divide it by 365 that 's the per diem or daily interest for example 10,000 dollar auto loan at 3 10000 300 so each day the balance is 10k the loan cost 82 cents so in a month your first payment is 100 dollars goes to interest goes to principal then the new principal is so the next month another 30 days with the new per diem of the 100 payment is in principal in interest and so on

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

i think the survey needs to be broken down to as a consumer and as a merchant   i 'm not sure any service like the one you propose can be really implemented on the consumer side    in particular i suspect few if any consumers would pay for the privilege   you might look into the company neat who sold a specialized scanner and software package designed around organizing a while back    retailer buy in is a huge factor too   you can create a platform and encourage retailers to send via email or whatever but at the end of the day a lot of retailers still see value in a 5x as long as it should be to itemize the 22 ways you saved money and the 19 cross promotions or coupons they want to inform you of     unless you can provide equal value for them they wo n't be interested even if consumers like the concept   the classic example in this debate is the us chain cvs whose long are the butt of many jokes but persist because they 're part of an elaborate reward scheme where they give people coupons in the hopes of them coming back to use them   as for the smaller vendors who may not be as tied to such strategies they 're also likely going to be less technically equipped to cope with   a new feature   you almost need to target the pos vendors like ncr and if you can make electronic a feature in their platform it becomes something that hundreds of stores are getting built into their systems for free and they just have to turn it on   that 's a lot easier than selling to every single retailer one at a time and it would be a big enough launch that you could start to get customer preference

many of my friends said i should invest my money on stocks or something else instead of put them in the bank forever i do not know anything about finance so my questions are first let me say that your friends may have the best intentions but do n't trust them it has been my experience that friends tell you what they would do if they had your money and not what they would actually do with their money now i do n't mean that they would be malicious or that they are out to get you   what i do mean is why would you take advise from someone about what they would do with 100k when they do n't have 100k i am in your financial situation more or less and i have friends that make more then i do and have no savings or that will tell you to get an ira and so but do n't have the means discipline to do so do not listen to your friends on matters of money that 's just good all around advise is my financial status ok if not how can i improve it any financial situation with no or really low debt is ok i would say 5 of annual income in unsecured debt or 2 3 years in annual income in secured debt is a good place to be that is a really hard mark to hit it seems you have hit it so your good right now you may want to plan for the future immediate goals that i always tell people are 6 months of income stuck in a liquid savings account then start building a solid investment situation and a decent retirement plan this protects you from short term situations like loss of job while doing something for the future    is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor is it worthy how would she he help me rather it 's worth it or not to use a financial adviser is going to be totally opinion based personally i think they are worth it others do not i see it like this unless you want to spend all your time looking up money stuff the adviser is going to have a better grasp of money stuff then you because they do spend all their time doing it that being said there is one really important thing to consider that is going to be how you pay the adviser the following are my observations you will need to make up your own mind   free avoid like the plague these advisers are usually provided by the bank and make their money off commission or kickbacks that means they will advise you of the product that makes them the most money not you   flat rate these are not a bad option but they do n't have any real incentive to make you money usually they do a decent job of making you money but again it 's usually better for them to advise you on products that make them money per hour these are my favorite they charge per hour usually they are a small shop and will walk you through all the advise they advise what 's best for you because they have to sit there and explain their choices they can be hard to find but are generally the best option in my opinion    of money these are like the flat rate advisers to me they get a percentage of the money you give them to manage because they already have your money they are more likely to recommend products that are in their interest that said there not all bad or profit these are the best see notes later they get a percentage of the money they make for you they have the most interest in making you money they only get part of what you get so there going to make sure you get the biggest pie so they can get a bigger slice notes in the real world all advisers are likely to get kickbacks on products they recommend make sure to keep an eye for that also most advisers will use 2 3 of the methods listed above for billing something like of profit + $ x per hour is what i like to see you will have to look around and see what is available   just remember that you are paying someone to make you money or to advise you on how to make money so long as what they take leaves you with some profit your in a better situation then your are now and that 's the real goal

usually a financial advisor makes his money by selling financial investments   thus almost anyone you talk to is going to try to get you to be investment products which is not what you need to be doing at this point    you should be focusing on paying off all your debt first before doing any investment   the interest you are paying on credit cards is most likely much more than the money you could get from any type of investment   however once you have your consumer debt paid off i recommend talking to any friends co workers or other professional advisors you have such as attorneys or accountants   when you ask such people for the referrals find out how much debt they have how much they are investing   pay closer attention to those with a higher net worth otherwise you may be getting advice from someone fooled by the same sort of financial advisor you are trying to avoid

does the 5 year rule apply on the after tax 401k > roth 401k > roth    ira conversion of the 20000 including 10000 earnings that was    originally pre tax no the after tax amounts are not subject to the 5 years rule the earnings are how does this affect roth ira withdrawal ordering rules with respect    to the taxable portion of a single conversion being withdrawn before    the non taxable portion taxable portion first until exhausted to better understand how it works you need to understand the rationale behind the 5-year rule consider you have $ 100 k in your ira traditional and you want to take it out just withdrawing it would trigger a 10 k statutory penalty on top of the taxes due but you can use the backdoor roth ira right so convert the 100 k and then it becomes after tax contribution to roth ira and can be withdrawn with no penalty one form filled ad 10 k saved to block this loophole here comes the 5 years rule you can not withdraw after tax amounts for at least 5 years without penalty if the source was taxable conversion thus in order to avoid the 10 k penalty in the above situation you have a 5-year cooling period which makes the loophole useless for most cases however amounts that are after tax can be withdrawn without penalty already even from the traditional ira so there 's no need in the 5 years cooling period the withdrawal attribution is in this order roth ira rollovers are sourced to the origin e.g. if you converted $ 100 to the roth ira at firm x and then a year later rolled it over to firm y it does n't affect anything and the clock is ticking from the original date of the conversion at firm x. 5-year period applies to each conversion rollover from a qualified retirement plan see here distributions are applied to the conversions in fifo order so in one distribution depending on the amounts you may hit several different incoming conversions the 5 years should be check on each of them and the penalty applied on the amounts attributable to those that do n't have enough time 5-year period for contributions applies starting from the beginning of the first year of the first contribution that established your roth ira plan the penalty applies to the amounts that were included in your gross income when conversion occurred i.e. does n't apply on the amounts converted from after tax sources note the difference from the traditional ira distributions from pre tax sources are prorated between the non deductible basis amounts and the deductible earnings amounts taxable that is why the taxable amounts are first in the ordering of the distributions

why is nobody providing a service that is basically give me your money i will invest it as i see fit a year later i will return the capital to you plus half of any profits or losses this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses because they can already make lots of money by just charging people an fee and not having to cover their losses   why take on the risk of having to cover your losses when they can just take a percentage of your assets and stick you with any losses in addition as charles e. grant mentioned in a comment on another answer if a person has both sufficient capital to cover your losses and sufficient confidence in their investing acumen that they do n't think they will have to do so they have little need for your money   rather than take half the gains on your money they will invest their own money they must have some or else they ca n't guarantee your losses and take all the gains your scheme would only be plausible as a partnership between a person with investing skills but little capital and another person with ample capital and less skill   in that case the investment could genuinely benefit from access to the 's capital   as quid noted in chat this does exist in the form of ad hoc private equity arrangements between individuals   however such a setup is unlikely to exist as an off the shelf product marketed at retail investors because financial institutions have more capital than any individual retail investor and more generally anyone with sufficient skill to pull this off will at least in theory quickly accumulate enough capital that they can negotiate a less risky payment plan

i hope i 'm misunderstanding your plan you want to invest in a way that will make so much that you pay back all of the loan payments with investment gains like the answer i gave on the preceding question and like @littleadv 's comment mhoran 's answers do n't do this no good will come of it   this strategy requires higher returns but does not necessarily give you a better return    but because you asked the question again let me specify what you 're missing i do think that learning is a good thing it boils down to two very significant problems that you have n't addressed   1 where are you getting your monthly income from   2 realistic vs. how big do any gains have to be and does that exist in the real world in a way that you can capture   in a nutshell if my answer to the last question showed that it 's crazy to invest and pay back out of your capital and income since you 're trying to keep your capital and only pay back with monthly gains this one will require even higher and thus more unrealistic gains   the model you 're implying   if that 's what you mean with this model which i think you do then here are my two very key questions again how are you getting your monthly income financial investments i.e. stocks or bonds will have two components of value one component of value is the stream of payments such as a monthly dividend from stocks that pay those or the interest payment from a bond the other is the ability to resell a security to another investor receiving back your capital   so you either have to find stocks that pay > 52 returns tax free each year and pay this loan off with the payments or higher returns to cover taxes but these kinds of investments do not exist for you   or you can try to invest in something pray that it goes up per month and so that you can sell it pay back your loan payment with the proceeds and use the capital to buy your next investment that will go up per month to turn and sell it again   the pros that do model this type of speculation go into much more depth than you are capable of they build models that incorporate probabilities for rates of return based on historical data they have better information and have specialized in calculating this all out they even have access to better investment opportunities like pre ipo twitter or private notes you just wo n't find the opportunities to make this happen each month for 24 months again you wo n't find them they do not exist for you in as an investor in securities realistic vs. so clearly i hope that by now i have convinced you that these would be the required returns they simply are n't available to you if they were you would still run into obstacles with converting book returns into physical money that you could repay the loans with and then continuing that growth   and while i appreciate the notion that if i could just make the payments each month i 'd have $ 10,000 after 24 months i guarantee you that you 'll be better off finding another way to target that same investment   along the lines of what mhoran said if you aim for a basic 401 k or other similar investment account and target it into the s&p500 you might see returns of anywhere from to + 25 over the next 24 months but if things went like they tend to average for the s&p500 it 's more like annually check out a savings target calculator like this one from bankrate.com and put in the numbers if you can save about $ 390 a month you 'll be at $ 10 k in 24 months it 's not as fun as the other but you can actually expect to achieve that   you will not find consistent > 50 returns on your money annually

if you 're referring to investment hedging then you should diversify into things that would profit if expected event hit for example alternative energy sources would benefit greatly from increased evidence of global warming or the onset of peak oil preparing for that would render the stock market inaccessible the answer is quite different   simply own more of things that people would want than you need   a list of possibilities would include precious metals are also a way to secure value outside the financial markets but would not be readily until the immediate calamity had passed all this should be balanced on an honest evaluation of the risks including the risk of nothing happening   i 've heard of people not saving for retirement because they do n't expect the financial markets to be available then but that 's not a risk i 'm willing to take

while you would reduce risk by diversifying into other stock etfs across the world developed market returns and emerging markets to a lesser extent are generally highly correlated with another correlation of 0.90 this implies that they all go up in bull markets and go down together in bear markets you are better off diversifying into other asset classes given your risk tolerance such as government bonds as you have mentioned alternatively you can target a portfolio owning all of the assets in the universe assuming you 're trading in frankfurt a combination of something similar to and but with higher volumes and/or lower fees a good starting resource would be the bogleheads wiki

many people who do transfer a balance from one credit card to another have no clue as to what is going on and how credit cards work if you transfer a balance from one credit card to another you are charged a fee of anywhere from 3 upwards subject to a minimum of $ 10 or so up front if credit card a has balance $ 1000 and you transfer it to credit card b which is offering no interest for a year on the transferred balance you owe credit card b $ 1050 say in most cases that $ 50 has to be paid off as part of the following month 's bill if you are carrying a revolving balance on credit card b that $ 50 will typically be charged interest from the day of the transfer your monthly bill will not necessarily include that $ 1000   you owe for one year or six months or whatever the transfer agreement you accepted says if you tend to pay anything less even a penny than   full payment of each month 's bill on credit card b your partial payment will be applied to that $ 1000 first and anything left over will be applied to the monthly balance in short if you do n't pay in full each month that $ 1000 will not be yours for a year you may end up paying $ 50 interest for   borrowing $ 1000 for just one or two months and the rest of your balance is the gift that keeps on giving as the credit card company likes to say update this has changed slightly in the united states any amount paid over the minimum amount due is charged to the higher interest balances so in this case if you had $ 1000 at a 0 promotional rate and a regular balance of $ 500 and the minimum payment was $ 100 and you paid $ 150 $ 100 would pay down the promotional balance and the extra $ 50 would pay down the regular balance   about the only way to make the deal work in your favor is to transfer money only if you have paid the full amount due    on the last two statements before the date of the transfer and are    not carrying a revolving balance check your monthly statements    to make sure they show finance charge of 0.00   many people have    never seen such a sight and are unaware that this can be observed    in nature make sure that you pay each month 's bill in full not    the minimum monthly payment due each month for a whole year    after that make sure that the bill containing that $ 1000 coming out a    year after the transfer date is also paid in full very many credit card users do not have the financial discipline to go through with this program   that is why credit card companies love to push transfer balances on consumers the whole thing is a cash cow for them where they in effect get to charge usurious rates of interest without running afoul of the law $ 50 interest for a one year loan of $ 1000 is pretty high at current rates $ 50 interest for a two or three month loan where the customer does not even notice the screwing he is getting is called laughing all the way to the bank see also the answers to   this question

you did n't mention a country and precise rules will be different from country to country the usual rules are   shares that you did n't sell do n't count if you buy shares there is no taxable gain until you sell them   when you sell shares it is assumed that the shares you are selling are the last ones that you bought   in many places if you sell shares and buy the same shares back very quickly the tax office may have rules to pretend you never sold the shares for example in the uk where a good amount of profit per year is tax free you ca n't just sell enough shares to stay below your tax limit and then buy them back to take profits out of the shares you own   in your case you made $ 30 profit on every share you sold and that is what you will be taxed for in most countries according to the rules of your country

what this means is this the authors of the website claim they have calculated the cost that it will take to fully fund the medicare medicare prescription drug program social security military and civil servant pensions they claim that the government will have to spend $ 114 t to do the things it is currently promising to do and it has n't set aside the money to do it that 's what is meant by an unfunded mandate firstly i would take with a grain of salt the calculations of any website which claims the us is a in its title you know they are coming to this with an agenda secondly this is money that the government has not actually spent the government does n't owe this money to anyone and it is absolutely untrue that you are responsible along with everyone else to pay this back the worst they can claim is that the government will one day have to spend it assuming that nothing else changes in that time a government could pass a law that reduced medicare or raised taxes and the unfunded mandate would simply go away thirdly the calculation must assume a time period over which the money is spent but the site carefully does n't specify it they can make the amount bigger or smaller as they choose just by changing the time period over which it is calculated to give an example an unfunded mandate is a bit like enrolling in a four year college course without knowing how you are going to pay for it you 've said you are going to spend money on tuition you may even have promised your mother you will finish the course but you can in fact drop out if you choose and you do n't owe anything for courses you have n't taken yet   some unfunded mandates can be legal obligations but this is n't one and in neither case are they money you actually owe that 's not to say that unfunded mandates are not a cause for concern they represent a discrepancy between what a government says it will do and what it can currently afford to do as an illustration of how this works you can look at either russia ten years ago or greece right now all the expenditures in these are being cut people are certainly angry but there is nothing they can do to force the government to make those payments

joetaxpayer 's answer is dead on but let me give my own two cents with a little bit of math otherwise i personally find that people talking about diversified portfolios tends to be full of buzzwords   let 's say that buffett 's investments are $ 10 million he would like to earn this year or $ 700,000   he can invest that money in coca which might return or he can invest in genius moves that will make headlines like buying huge stakes in goldman sachs which might return and he makes plays for the long haul based on the expected value of the investments so if he splits it 50/50 $ 5 $ 5 million then his expected value is by diversifying he does reduce the expected value of the portfolio he is not giving $ 10 m the chance to turn into $ 1.5 million or $ 2 million for him the expected value of that shock and portfolio with all $ 10 million invested in it is $ by taking less risk for less reward his expected return is lower but his risk is lower too   scale this example back up into the $ 100 million or billion range that buffett invests in and that extra margin makes the difference   in the context of your original article the lower risk cake and underwear investments let buffett go big on the things that will make 20%+ returns on billions of dollars without completely destroying his investment capital when things take a turn for the worse

there is no fundamental good reason i think that 's just how it 's done which is what all the other answers seem to be saying w/o coming out and admitting it just guessing but i 'll bet most of the reason is historical before up to the moment quotes were readily available that was a bit tedious to calculate update the fund 's value so enacted laws let it be done just once per day   quotes the security act of 1940 which certainly has been updated but also still might contain the results of like this there are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks though one share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock there is a finite supply of company x stock and people are trading that piece of ownership around and barter to find an mutually agreeable price   but when you buy into a mutual fund the mutual fund suddenly has more shares it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings   as a consequence the mutual fund 's price is n't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund and that 's the weighted total of its underlying stock   if you wanted to sell your ownership of mutual fund z to a friend at there would n't be any bartering you 'd just calculate the value based on the stated value of the underlying stock at that exact moment so there 's no inherent reason you ca n't instantaneously price a mutual fund   but people do n't really buy sell funds to each other they go to the fund manager and essentially make a deposit or withdraw   the fund manager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often so that 's all they do disclaimer i know very little about markets and finance but i recognize answers that are just because

from hmrc note that the rule is when a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings this is not necessarily the same as the date on which an employee acquires a right to be paid for example an employee 's terms of service may provide for the employee to receive a bonus for the year to 31 december 2004 payable on 30 june 2005 if the employee is still in the service of the employer on 31 december 2004 if the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 december 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 june 2005 so paye applies to it on 30 june 2005 and it is for the date that matters is the date the employee is entitled to be paid the bonus   but why are you worried about paying tax that is your employer 's responsibility and they will do it for you ask you firm 's finance department also for further clarification hmrc are not an organization to mess with they will tie up your life in knots

i 'm going to guess that you found this because of a stock screener   this company went through a reverse split on june 30 so every 20 shares outstanding became a single share   where before you had 20 shares worth $ 100 you now have 1 share worth $ 100 the value of the company does n't change because of a split   this company was never trading for $ 30 + per share   reverse splits are typical of a company trading on an exchange that has a minimum share price requirement   while reverse splits do n't change the value of the company just the number of shares outstanding and the price per share no healthy company performs a reverse split   reverse splits are generally a massive signal to jump ship the company seems to be trading for $ 1 right now why the value fell from a pre split $ 1.65 $ to $ 1 is anyone 's guess how the company ever got to $ 1.65 is also anyone 's guess but looking at the most recent 10-q there are numerous causes for concern   note 2 capital stock on march 6 2017 the company issued as compensation for services provided a total of common shares with a fair value of $ to a third party the fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the otc pink sheets on the grant date this indicates a share price of $ $ as of just to reinforce that the google price chart does n't show the true past but a past adjusted for the split results of operations the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 for the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 total revenues were $ 0 and $ 0 respectively and net losses from operations were $ and $ respectively the net losses were attributable to costs attributable to operating as a public company in particular common stock with a valuation of $ that was issued to an investor relations firm in the first quarter of 2017 going concern as of march 31 2017 there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern     liquidity and capital resources we had no cash as of the date of march 31 2017 additionally since there is no balance sheet in the last 10-q another bad sign the last annual report 10-k has this balance sheet so the company so why did the stock value plummet it 's guess but there is no shortage of ways to justify it    in fact it 's reasonable to ask how is this company still worth $ 3 mm $ 1 3 mm shares outstanding

as you note your question is inherently opinion based   that said if i were in your situation i would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy hopefully some index etf or mutual fund according to what i see the current value of the hd stock is about $ 8500 and the jnj stock is worth less than $ 500   with a total investment of less than $ 10,000 any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms this is doubly true since you were given the stock so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all   if you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis it could be worth keeping if you believed in yourself or even if you just wanted to test your acumen but as it is the stock is essentially random   even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation it does n't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason   if you were going to put everything in one stock you 'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked   i still think it would be a bad idea but at least it would be a more defensible idea so i would say the risk of your lopsided allocation just two companies with more than 90 of the value in just one outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain   if news breaks tomorrow that the ceo of home depot has been or if trump decides to go on the twitter for some reason your investment could disappear another common way to think about it is if you had $ 9000 today to buy stocks with would you buy $ 8500 worth of hd and $ 500 worth of jnj   if not it probably does n't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them the only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations   you did n't mention what your basis in the stock is   looking at historical prices it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 8000 and if all of it was 10 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 6000   if your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket and sell the rest next year   however i think this situation is unlikely because a since the stock has been held for a long time most of the gains will be at the lower long term rate b if you have solid income you can probably afford the tax and c if you do n't have solid income your long term capital gains rate will likely be zero

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

with the scenario that you laid out ie 5 and 10 loans it makes no sense at all the problem is when you 're in trouble the rates are never 5 or 10 getting behind on credit cards sucks and is really hard to recover from the problem with multiple accounts is that as the banks tack on fees and raise your interest rate to the default rate usually 30 when you give them any excuse late payment over the limit etc the banks will also cut your credit lines as you make payments making it more likely that you will bump over the limit and be back in default status one payment even at a slightly higher rate is preferable when you 're deep in the hole because you can actually pay enough to hit principal if you have assets like a house you 'll get a much better rate as well in a scenario where you 're paying 22 25 interest your minimum payment will be $ 150 200 a month and that is mostly interest and penalty one big loan will usually result in a smaller payment and you do n't end up in a situation where the banks are for position so they get paid first the danger of consolidation is that you 'll stop triggering defaults and keep making your payments so your credit score will improve then the will start circling and offering you more credit cards edit mea   i wrote this based on experiences of close friends whom i 've helped out over the years not realizing how the law changed in 2009   back around 2004 a single late payment would trigger universal default on most cards jacking all rates up to 30 and slashing credit lines resulting in over the limit and other fees credit card banks generally apply payments in order to interest on penalties penalties interest on principal principal in a way that makes it very difficult to pay down principal for people deep in debt they would also offer payment plans to entice you to pay bank b vs. bank a which would trigger fees from bank a. another change is that minimum payments were generally 2 of statement balance which often did n't cover the monthly finance charge the new law changed that resulting in a payment of 1 of balance + accrued interest under the old regime consolidation made it less likely that various circumstances would trigger default and gave the struggling debtor one throat to choke with the new rules there are definitely a smaller number of scenarios where consolidation actually makes sense

yes depending on what you 're trying to achieve if its just a symbolic gift you can use a service like this there are several companies providing this service look them up but the prices are fairly the same you 'll end up getting a real stock certificate but it will cost a lot of overhead around $ 40 to get the certificate and then another $ 40 to deposit it into a brokerage account if you want to sell it on a stock exchange so although the certificate is real and the person whose name on it is a full blown shareholder it does n't actually have much value unless you buy a google or apple stock where the price is much much higher than the fees take into account that it takes around 2 months for the certificate to be issued and mailed to you so time accordingly otherwise you can open a custodial brokerage account and use it to buy stocks for the minor both ways are secure and legal each for its own purpose and with its own fees

i went through the process so i 'll add my experience for on the morning of the day i was ready to pay i went to my mortgage company 's web site and got an instant payoff statement dated for the same day this had the final payoff amount as well as addresses to send checks and information about wiring i printed this statement out and took it to my bank the same day and told them that i wanted to wire money they referred to the printout and sent the money to the mortgage company the next day the mortgage company web site indicated that the loan was paid in full although sending a check and the payoff statement indicated that cashier 's checks were preferred wiring the money was an easy process and helped me to overcome my concerns about   situations that   might arise if mail had been used i.e. i did not want to deal with the complexity of day late day early fees credits and i did not want to worry about the complexity of potentially losing a cashier 's check in the mail

alternative minimum tax is based not just on your income but moreso on the deductions you use in short if you have above the minimum amt threshold of income per your link and pay a tiny amount of tax you will pay amt amt is used as an overall protection for the government to say okay you can use these deductions from your taxable income but if you 're making a lot of money you should pay something no matter what your deductions are this extra amt can be used to reduce your tax payment in a future year if you pay regular tax again for example if you have 60k in income but have 60k in specific deductions from your income you will pay zero regular tax because your taxable income will be zero amt would require you to pay some tax on your income above the minimum threshold which might work out to a few thousand bucks next year if you have 60k in income but only 15k in deductions then you would pay some regular tax and would be able to offset that regular tax by claiming a credit from your amt already paid   amt is really a pre payment of tax paid in years when you have a lot of deductions unless you have a lot of deductions every single year in which case you might not be able to get all of your amt refunded in the end wikipedia has a pretty good summary of amt in the us here   if you think amt is unfair and maybe in some cases you might pay it when you think it 's unfair look at the root causes of paying amt listed in that wikipedia article i am not trying to convince you that amt is fair just that it applies only when someone already has a very low tax rate due to deductions if you have straight salary income it would only apply in rare scenarios

most personal loans in the us are for the purpose of purchasing some tangible object usually a house or car and that object is the collateral for the loan indeed the loan proceeds are usually paid directly to the seller without passing through the bank account of the borrower and the seller delivers the title of the car to the lender or a mortgage lien is recorded on the real property except possibly in the case of a refinance of a home mortgage   there is not much cash from such a loan to send to a friend to invest in his business whether in the us or in india   these types of loans are relatively easy to get much harder to get are unsecured personal loans unless your friend has a very friendly banker getting an unsecured loan of say $ 20,000 just for the heck of it is not easy some reasonably well off people do manage to get such loans and use the money to invest in the stock or bond markets in which case the interest paid on such loans can be deducted on   schedule a but only to the extent of the actual investment income any extras can be carried over to the next year so will your friend be investing in your business or making a loan to your business and do you anticipate that your business will generate any investment income or interest for your friend if not and your friend still wants to finance your business while making payments on the loan in the us then your friend must really like you a lot or have faith that a few years down the road you will be able to sell your business to for big bucks and pay him off very handsomely

not a lot directly your biggest direct risk is that you could buy the debt and buy it at too high a price i.e. too low an interest rate and not make as much money as you ought and maybe not enough to cover inflation especially if you buy long term bonds at low interest rates the indirect risks are mostly that the debt could weigh on economic growth there is also a question of monetary policy inflation and interest rates set by the federal reserve theoretically the government could be tempted to keep interest rates low to save money and buy its own bonds printing money which could cause inflation theoretically they should n't as price stability is one of the fed 's primary mandates but if they did inflation makes everything less predictable and is generally obnoxious which makes everything more risky and drags on the economy also if the nominal value of an asset rises due to inflation you will likely need to pay taxes on that at some point if you sell it even though its real value is the same

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

in its basic form a corporation is a type of privileged democracy instead of every citizen having a vote votes are allocated on the basis of share ownership in the most basic form each share you own gives you 1 vote in most public companies very few shareholders vote because their vote is statistically meaningless and they have no particular insight into what they want in their board this means that often the board is voted in by a ie of shareholders who are actually large institutions like investment firms or pension funds which own many shares of the company now what do shareholders actually vote on you vote to elect individuals to be members of the board of directors bod the bod is basically an overarching committee that theoretically the company in whatever way they feel best represents the shareholders because if they do not represent the shareholders they will get voted out at the next shareholder meeting the board members are typically senior individuals with experience in either that industry or a relevant one ie someone who was a top lawyer may sit on the bod and be a member of some type of legal issues committee these positions typically pay some amount of money but often they are seen as a form of high prestige for someone nearing after retirement it is not typically a full time job it will typically pay far far less than the role of ceo at the same company   the bod meets periodically to discuss issues regarding the health of the company their responsibility is to act in the interests of the shareholders but they themselves do not necessarily own shares in the company often the bod is broken up into several committees such as an investment committee which reviews and approves large scale projects a finance committee which reviews and approves large financial decisions such as how to get funding an audit committee which reviews the results of financial statements alongside the external accountants who audit them etc but arguably the main role of the bod is to hire the chief executive officer and possibly other high level individuals typically referred to as the c suite executives ie chief financial officer chief operating officer etc the ceo is the big cheese who then typically has authority to rule everyone below him her typically there are things that the big cheese can not do without approval from the board like start huge investment projects requiring a lot of spending   so the shareholders own the company and are therefore entitled to receive all the dividends from profits the company earns and members of the board of directors the bod oversees the company on the shareholders behalf and the ceo acts based on the wishes of the bod which hires him her so how do you get to be a member of the board or the ceo you become a superstar in your industry and go through a similar process as getting any other job you network you make contacts you apply you defend yourself in interviews the shareholders will elect a board who acts in their interests and the board will hire a ceo that they feel can carry out those interests if you hold a majority of the shares in a company you could elect enough board members that you could control the bod and you could then be guaranteed to be hired as the ceo if you own say 10 of the shares you will likely be able to elect a few people to the board but maybe not enough to be hired by the board as the ceo   short of owning a huge amount of a company therefore share ownership will not get you any closer to being the ceo

your assumption is wrong land is definitely on the other hand it may be simpler and attract a lower interest rate if you just mortgage your existing house i believe most companies call this remortgaging even if you have no existing mortgage any loan will be subject to proof that you 'll be able to pay it off like any other mortgage if the land itself is mortgaged you would need a deposit i.e. the value of the mortgage would need to be less than the value of the land

+ 1 they are over priced to begin with more specifically they are expensive to create exclusivity which raises their value to people who value that kind of thing perhaps folks who buy those cars are n't buying them for value or quality or performance but are buying them for the badge and the intangible factors   i frequently hear about rich people who earned their millions driving around in cars consumer reports rank highly so it is n't because they are so much better than a mid priced car a car for $ 140,000 is either equipped for the a team or is a status symbol   the status symbol notion is very expensive but fades very quickly hence the mighty depreciation

i am a bit confused here as to how a 4 k loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time   fico scores are based upon how well you borrow   if you borrow pay back on time your score will not go down   perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan but that should come back quickly   in the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections if the score is so important to you which i think is somewhat unwise then use a credit card   with a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate but assume it is 18   in less then 9 months you will have it paid off paying about $ in interest   you could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score   again not what i would advise but it might meet your needs one alternative is go with lending club   with that kind of score you are looking at 7 or so   at $ 500 a month you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $ 100 in interest   much less money for improving your credit score edit based upon the comment my understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit even if you pay your bills on time define bad   as i said it might go down slightly in the short term   in three months you will have almost 33 of the loan paid off which is significantly lower then the original balance   if you go the credit card route you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000 which may not move the needle at all   are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days   if not why does a small short term dip matter   will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in   if you worship your fico score which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what i am suggesting

first you need to see if you actually qualify as a dependent under irs rules in short while there may be exceptions to the rule i am not sure what those could be   the takeaway is that if your parent is wishing to claim you as a dependent they must be responsible for supporting the majority of your living expenses e.g. food and shelter if this is the case then the next question is to look at how the impact of the exemptions play out   in your situation i would guess that your mother is correct   your taxable income is likely to be so low that if you do not take an exemption for yourself you probably would still have zero or minimal tax liability but if you mother claims you as a dependent she will be able to take a deduction in the case of your grants and loans the loans should not be taxable income since these need to be repaid presumably with future earnings   federal grants may be taxable basically the portion of the grant that is used solely for paying educational expenses toward a specific degree tuition and books is non taxable but the remainder may be subject to tax as for tax credits you would need to see how much you would get and how they would apply to you   the bottom line is there are too many variables to say for certain what the best approach would be so both your and your mother 's returns must be prepared under each scenario you as her dependent versus you claiming a personal exemption

the benefit of the 401 k and iras are that reallocating and re balancing are easy they do n't want you to move the funds every day but you are not locked in to your current allocations the fact that you mentioned in a comment that you also have a roth ira means that you should look at all retirements as a whole   look at what options you have in the 401 k and also what options you have with the ira then determine the overall allocation between bonds stocks international reit etc then use the mix of funds   in the ira and 401 k to meet that goal asking if the 401 k should be small and mid cap only ca n't be answered without knowing not just your risk tolerances but the total money in the 401 k and ira   pick an allocation map the available funds to that allocation rebalance every year but review the allocation in a few years or after a life event such as change of job getting married having kids or buying a house

to address the issue in the title of your question many expenses strike at what for all practical purposes are random intervals roof starts leaking car needs repair etc do n't have a fixed cost every month medical expenses can certainly be more extreme than many other expenses but their nature is the same and so the way to budget for them is the same you figure out what your average expenses are over a long period of time then you start putting away a little more than this amount every month keep putting away until you have a reserve larger than any expense you are likely to get hit with all at once   i have no idea what your particular expenses are so let me use myself for an example my medical bills last year were unusually large about $ 6,000 i have lousy insurance and a couple of chronic conditions so my bills are usually maybe $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per year so i plan on about $ 150 per month for medical bills most insurance policies have an out of pocket maximum this should be the most you 'd ever have to lay out in a year mine is $ 13,000 i told   you my insurance sucks so i have an account that i have now built up to $ 13,000 worst case i wipe out that account in any case if my bills are that large the doctors or hospital will normally agree to a payment plan i still owe a few hundred on my bills from last year and the hospital is letting me pay it off at $ 120 per month your question brings up a lot of issues about difficulties of working with insurance and the u.s. medical system in general i 'm not sure if your intent was to get advice on the rest of it all simple not pleasant but simple answer if you 're insurance is provided by your employer you 're pretty much stuck with the policy that the employer negotiates i do n't know how much you 're contributing to premiums usually the company pays the bulk of it you could investigate getting a policy on your own but odds are that any policy you could get for what you 're contributing now would be way worse than what you can get through the company you could always investigate but i doubt you 'll do better you can talk to hr if it 's a big company they may have some muscle with the insurance company and could help you out failing that it becomes a political question of how the laws affecting medical care and insurance in the u.s. are set up and while i have many ideas for how it could be improved sadly i 'm not in a position to do much about it and i doubt you are either unless you have the resources to run for president

you receive a 1099-misc for the value of the car you claim that as income even though you received goods rather than cash when you sell the car it would be much like selling any and would cause no tax consequence unless the sale price was much different than the value when you sell the car you may have received more or less than the value of the car likely less if you sold it for more then you might need to claim the additional money as income perhaps short term capital gains if you sold it for less but to a friend or relative then you might think you could claim a loss but the tax collector would just claim that you had given them a gift and attempt to collect the tax from them contest winners often have the frustration that they are taxed at the full value of the won even though they would not value the item at that amount and contest prizes often do not sell for the full value stated on the 1099 and often for much less marginal tax rates were higher prior to reagan and when a contest winner would sell an item for 80 of the value they often paid most of the proceeds to taxes

please note before taking any steps towards a transaction involving possible capital gains tax exclusions please consult your cpa attorney or tax advisor i am not a cpa or tax advisor since you have only lived in it 11 months you do n't meet the use test for full exclusion however even if you have n't lived in it that long you may be able to exclude some of the gains due to a unforeseen circumstance not just because you wanted to move you say you are ready for a change and so that means it 's an arbitrary decision not a forced one to calculate the partial exclusion take the number of months you lived there before the sale and divide it by 24 = 0.45 so for an unmarried person you can exclude up to $ 250,000 multiply that by and you get $ if your profit after everything is taken out is only $ 35,000 then you can exclude that from capital gains because it is less than $   all that being said you will need documentation in case you get audited for more information see irs publication 551 basis of assets and look for the section on real property see also this irs tax topic on sale of your home

market makers shortened mm in an exchange are generally required to list both a bid and ask price to allow both buyers and sellers to trade and keep the market moving   however a more general idea of a mm may includes companies off an exchange say large banks acting as broker dealers in an over the counter market are not required to give a simultaneous bid ask but often will on request   so it might depend on where you are getting this data but likely the bid ask was quoted simultaneously an exchange like the nasdaq for instance may have multiple mms for a given market   the market spread will be from the highest bid to the lowest ask over all the mms   the highest bid and lowest ask may come from different mms and any particular mm often will have a larger spread the size of the spread gives a rough idea of how much a mm is trying to make off of a round trip trade buying than immediately selling to someone else or selling than immediately buying from someone else   of course immediate round trip trades are not always possible and there are many other complications   however half the spread is a rough indicator of how much they hope to make off of a single trade

i would question whether your stated goal of strictly controlling your expenses is really the problem you should be tackling   in my opinion unless you 're under financial hardship where you can barely make ends meet you 're much better off using a budget as a high level descriptive tool rather than a low level tool this is what i would do in your situation after the first few months you can start to think about high level changes that you can make to your spending habits to get the most bang for your buck   i would n't worry about the little expenses unless they 're really adding up to a sizable chunk of your total expenses   instead i would look at things like eating out too often buying too many movies too many impulse buys over $ 100 etc identifying patterns like that will help you make lifestyle changes that will allow you to spend less money without having to micromanage every single expense   i have tried the micromanaged approach in the past and it simply does n't work for me   there 's too much overhead and eventually i start to feel that it 's just not worth it   think about it is it really worth the extra time and energy required to worry about where every dollar goes all month long just to save an additional hundred bucks over what you can do with this passive approach    i think that by focusing on the big picture you can get within a couple percentage points of the same amount of savings as if you had micro managed your expenses but with much less work and mental strain let 's put some numbers on this and see what the hourly returns are with each approach always being optimistic about the micromanaged approach and conservative on the passive approach    let 's assume you earn $   let 's also assume that if you micromanage all of your expenses you could manage to save $ beyond what you do now   and let 's say that with the passive approach you can get within 20 percentage points instead of the 2 i stated earlier for a savings of $   now what will your hourly returns look like   the following are based on how i would personally use both systems so your numbers may vary a bit micromanaged budgeting savings = $ 5000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 15 30 minutes per day = 7.5 15 hours per month   hourly return = $ $   passive budgeting savings = $ 4000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 1 2 hours per month hourly return = $ $ so clearly the passive approach gives a substantially higher hourly return even though it gives a lower absolute return   maybe more importantly though if passive budgeting opens up an extra 10 hours a month you could potentially put those hours into your job and make an extra 10 hours $ = $ 250 a month or $ 3000 per year assuming no extra pay for overtime   so that means that the passive budgeting approach would actually allow you to save $ 4000 + $ 3000 .75 = $ per year compared to the $ 5000 you would save by micromanaging if you 're in a situation where you ca n't put those hours into more work and you really need that extra $ per month to help make ends meet then by all means micromanage your expenses and try to save as much as possible   but if either of the previous conditions are not true for you you 're much better off in my opinion using a passive budget

having been in the situation of commuting and working long hours at a low wage to just scrape by i faced the following dilemma i used all my income to pay bills and taxes and could not afford to go back to college to get another degree or pay for distance learning even if i could afford to pay for classes i could n't figure out when i 'd have the time to study because i was often only home 9 hours a day and needed to eat and sleep shower and get ready for work a wealthy friend of mine liked to read books about people who great obstacles and she was sure i could figure out lot a way to improve my situation if i 'd just try harder one day i handed her a piece of paper showing my income after taxes and monthly bills and asked her to get back to me with a plan that would allow me to afford classes and give me say an average of 6 hours of study time per week she was happy to do it here was her for opportunity to show me it was possible to pull myself up by my bootstraps after she studied my income expenses and schedule she decided she could n't devise a plan that would work and she never again told me i was n't trying hard enough

first of all lending is in my opinion the riskiest piece of the capital stack it has all the drawbacks of debt with none of the benefits of equity you can be rest assured when shit goes south the market goes   through the about as fast as you can blink they are the most marginal piece of the capital stack and only seem to appear in red hot markets which is to say late stage markets   also this article defines terms and talks about economic macro metrics like that somehow informs the reader that the chinese real estate market is a good investment yes gdp growth informs rent growth and overall demand but that like saying gdp growth increases corporate earning no duh that does n't tell me if the the cap rate already prices in that growth or what if the pipeline of development is    not to mention investing in another market in the most speculative risk curve of an alternative asset with no liquidity or legal recourse yeah no    edit and current exchange risk

before this agreement every country had laws on tax ability of income including global incomes quite a few individuals would get away and did not report such income and pay tax if due in fact quite a few multi national banks actively created products that helped us citizens to move money outside and skip reporting u.s. in order to step up this effort enacted fatca essentially as a compliance mechanism it started with us head banks operating globally and made reporting mandatory it stepped up efforts with other countries to ensure foreign banks also enhance reporting of us nationals   see the benefits quite a few countries joined up together and as part of oecd came up with crs thus going forward it will enable tax authorities in member countries to exchange financials impacting taxes the scope is also for companies organization as quite a few companies hide away income outside the domiciled country i have heard a rumor that due to the upcoming common reporting standard the details of bank accounts including all transactions will be reported all around the industrialized world and want to know if this is true yes this is true and it is not a rumor the exact amount of data and type of data will be agreed between member countries however a broad framework exists on what needs to be shared is it really true that the common reporting standard is going to cause things like this to happen   it is very important to note there is no new tax legislation even without fatca crs a honest tax payer was bound to pay legitimate tax due as per the existing tax provisions of the country along with the provisions of dtaa dual tax avoidance agreements the crs only enables monitoring and compliance so if one was already tax compliant there is nothing to worry if one was exploiting the loop hole how will authorities know well this will be going forward as a note canada and australia will start crs reporting from 2018

well the potential problem is that the ftse 100 could go down or just not up really it 's as simple as that after all why diversify if the ftse 100 will only go up so the question is why wait to diversify why not add in the gilt etf for a little government bond exposure why not a corp. bond etf maybe a little of that global ex uk for a little foreign stock exposure   that said saving is better than not saving so if starting it off with just the ftse 100 gets you saving go for it

as a manufacturing and facilities engineer i might be able to provide some insight     it 's one thing to have the technology   it 's another to make a business case for implementing the new technology   factories are big expensive things   they take a long time to pay for themselves generally   the switch from steam to electric power as the article pointed out required a completely new approach to facility design   this is n't something that happens overnight   for most companies and most applications the business case would indicate that you run with the old technology until you need to replace then you replace with the new technology   this delays your spend and allows you to get better roi on the existing facility     if the change to electricity only effected the local manufacturing cells within the plant we would've seen its implementation much faster   that was n't the case   the only way to run it efficiently is to build an entirely new facility   it 's a lot easier and quicker to turn a jet ski than it is to turn an oil tanker just ask the john mccain

i usually use this process   determine fair market value this will be an estimate from kbb or similar minus any known repairs or maintenance needed if fmv < $ 0 walk away and sell it for whatever it will bring you would be better off even just buying a similar model   than buying the repair if fmv > $ 0 ask yourself this question   if i had the fair market value in cash would i purchase this car essentially this is what you are doing if you choose to keep it this is where your needs and opinions come into play if you would n't sell it and buy something else unless you have certain specific numbers on the future maintenance and repairs needed you are just speculating on future events in general the probability of repair for the age and condition will be reflected in the estimate of value so that is captured in the analysis already   there is also no guarantee that another car would not have some other large repair even if it was newer   from just the numbers i ca n't think of many reasons not to drive a car until it dies fmv < $ 0 or until you find an excellent deal to replace it

since recent changes to credit scoring july 2017 it may not be to do this as more emphasis is placed on having a timely payment history and less emphasis is placed on having a low credit utilization ratio using what ’s known as data is the biggest change the phrase    means credit scores will take into account the trajectory of a    borrower ’s debts on a month to month basis in fact having a low credit utilization ratio may even negatively effect you if your available credit line value is high vantagescore will now mark a borrower negatively for having    excessively large credit card limits on the theory that the person    could run up a high credit card debt quickly those who have prime    credit scores may be hurt the most since they are most likely to have    multiple cards open but those who like to play the credit card    rewards program points game could be affected as well source

firstly if you 've formed a limited company you do n't need to register as self employed   you 're an employee and shareholder of the company and your taxes will be handled that way registering as self employed is only necessary if you 're operating as a sole trader i.e. without a company secondly you absolutely do want to get set up correctly with hmrc as soon as possible whether you 're a company or a sole trader   ignoring the legal question your worry about paying taxes when you have no income is if you 're not making any money there wo n't be any tax to pay   furthermore it seems likely that the business is currently losing money   those losses if correctly recorded can be carried forward and offset against future profits so not only do you not have to pay tax now but you can reduce the tax you pay later when the money does start rolling in

i think you wrong about this there are two problems i see with your example   when you created something which costs $ 150 you have increased the amount of money in the world from $ 200 to $ 450 because money is the storage of value   after the first transaction you have said that you have $ 250 which presumably means the money in the bank however at a later point when you go to the bank demanding $ 500 you only consider physical notes to be money the bank at this point could give you a check book and if you wanted to spend it would simple credit the other person $ 500 and remove that amount from your account in addition the bank could always repossess the items you have sold to the other person and give them to you in lieu of physical money

the key two things to consider when looking at similar identical etfs is the typical or indicative spread and the trading volume and size of the etf just like regular stocks thinly traded etf 's often have quite large spreads between buy and sell in the 1.5 range in some cases this is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants aps face issues in general with stock etfs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue as the creation redemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust it 's consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor on point 3 no this would create an arbitrage which an authorized participant would quickly take advantage of worth reading up about the creation and redemption mechanism here is a good place to start to understand the exact way this happens in etfs as it 's very key to how they work

the answer depends on this if you had to hire someone to do what you are doing in the s corp what would you pay them   if you are doing semi unskilled work part time then $ 20k might be reasonable   if you are a professional working full time it 's too low   do n't forget that in addition to billable work you are also doing office tasks such as invoicing and bookkeeping that the irs will also want to see you getting paid for there was an important court ruling on this subject recently watson v. commissioner   watson owned an s corp where he was the sole employee   the s corp itself was a 25 owner in a very successful accounting firm that watson worked through   all of the revenue that watson generated at the accounting firm was paid to the s corp which then paid watson through salary and distributions   watson was paying himself $ 24k a year in salary and taking over $ a year in distributions   for comparison even first year accountants at the firm were making more than $ 24k a year in salary   the irs determined that this salary amount was too low   to determine an appropriate amount for watson 's salary the irs did a study of the salaries of peers in firms of the same size as the firm watson was working with taking into account that owners of firms earn a higher salary than non owners   the number that the irs arrived at was $   watson was allowed to take the rest $ each year as distributions again this number was based on a study of the salaries of peers   it was far short of the $ 200k+ that the s corp was pulling in from the accounting firm   clearly watson was paying himself far too low of a salary   but even at this extreme example where watson 's s corp was directly getting all of its revenue from one accounting firm in which watson was an owner the irs still did not conclude that all of the revenue should have been salary and subject to payroll taxes you should ask an accountant or attorney for advice   they can help you determine an appropriate amount for your salary   do n't be afraid of an audit but make sure that you can defend your choices if you do get audited if your choices are based on professional advice that will help your case   see these articles for more information

try to sell if today 's google stock goes above 669 $ this is relative pegged to primary order with a limit price of $ 669 and an offset from national best offer of $ 0.00 but it is no different than an market order if the market price is $ 669 to begin with   do not sell if the stock keeps climbing beyond 669 unless there is a down tick of is seen this is a trailing stop order with a trailing amount of $ 0.20 it sells if the market price dropped $ 0.20 from the peak   the two orders are contradictory from your comments i think the following is what you want submit trailing stop order when market price is above $ 669   cancel trailing stop order before the end of the day and submit relative pegged to primary order to sell

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

yes if you gift him with a large amount you may be liable for gift tax i believe the current limit is still $ 17k per person per person per year so between you and your spouse you could give him up to $ per year without triggering gift tax if you want to give a larger sum the standard workaround is an intra family loan for that phrase to learn more about it but basically you loan the money and then gift the payments on the loan this gives him the money up front spreading the gift over subsequent years it requires that you declare the interest that he is supposedly paying you as income there is a lower limit on the interest rate for these loans but it 's a fraction of a percent so this generally is n't a significant cost if you are able to structure the loan as a mortgage he may be able to deduct the interest from his taxes that usually requires a few hundred dollars if paperwork to set up i 've done it it works and one of the advantages is that it puts the exact terms of the on paper where everyone can agree to them which could be useful should there be arguments later on   when doing business with friends and relatives keeping it on a clear business contract basis is the best way to avoid destroying the friendship

depending on your income savings level and who you work for if you work for a big company check with an hsbc premier advisor they may waive the requirements you may qualify for an hsbc premier account which can allow you to open accounts in different countries and transfer money between them without a fee you can also get a premier account without meeting the requirements if you are willing to pay a monthly fee but i doubt that will be worth it in the long run for what you need worth doing the math though if you travel frequently   note there may be similar offerings from other banks but this is just the only one i 'm aware of

i always hesitate to provide an answer to how does this affect my credit score questions because the credit agencies do not publish their formulas and the formulas do change over time and many others have done more reverse engineering than i to figure out what factors do affect the scores to some extent there is no way to know other than to get your credit score and track it over time the credit report will tell you what the largest negative factors are however let me make my prediction you have credit you are n't using a large percentage of it and do n't have defaults late payments so yes i think it would help your credit score and would build a history of credit since this is so unusual this is just an educated guess

buy and hope is a common investment strategy it 's also one that will keep you poor instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hard earned dollars why not use someone else 's money if you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own consider a duplex or where you live in one of the units since you will be living there you only need 5 down as opposed to 20 down if you do not live there this arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts if done properly you can find a place that is cash flow positive so you basically live rent free   this all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker they know all the rules and which banks have the best deal for you a mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution not you there are various caveats with this strategy and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan i suggest googling robert kiyosaki and reading rich dad poor dad before taking this journey he offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay i have taken the free evening seminar and the $ 500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them note that i have no affiliation with kiyosaki and i do find his methods to work

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

so first good job on making a thorough checklist of things to look into and onto your questions is this a worthwhile process even independent of specific investing goals learning how to research is valuable if you decided to forgo investing in stocks directly and chose to only invest in index funds the same type of research skills would be useful not to mention that such discipline would come in handy in other fields as well what other 80/20 low hanging fruit knowledge have i missed while it may not count as low hanging fruit one thing that stands out to me is there 's no mention of what competition a company has in its field for example a company may be doing well today but you may see signs that it 's consistently losing ground to its competition while that alone may not dissuade you from investing it may give you something to consider   is what i 've got so far any good or am i totally missing the point your cheat sheet seems pretty good to me but a lot depends on what your goals are if you 're doing this solely for your education and experience i would say you 've done well if you 're looking to invest in a company that is involved in a field you 're passionate about you 're on the right track but you should probably consider expanding your cheat sheet to include things that are not low hanging fruit but still matter to you   however i 'd echo the comments that have already been made and suggest that if this is for retirement investments take the skills you 've developed in creating your cheat sheet and apply that work towards finding a set of index funds that meet your criteria   otherwise happy hunting

in that case he was not arrested for being unable to pay his bill he received a summons to court failed to appear and so a warrant was issued for his arrest the $ 350 was his bail amount which is funds that must be provided to the court in order to be released while pending trial you get this money back once you appear before court he also was n't convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail in this case just arrested he would be kept by the courts if he could n't post bail until his court date as a way of being forced to appear if a judgement was awarded against him it still does n't always mean he has to pay if someone refuses to pay a judgement but did show up to court then typically their wages are garnished which means the court orders that a certain amount of money be withheld from income tax refunds etc until the judgement is paid however if the person ordered to pay can prove that they would not be able to have sufficient money to survive if they are garnished i 'm not a lawyer so i am unclear as to the exact process standards then there is a chance that nothing will be garnished at all   so in short no there is no such thing as debtor 's prison in the usa there is definitely such a thing as being arrested put in jail for court orders and i 'm sure if you took out loans while knowing you have no ability to repay them that you might be able to be charged with some sort of fraud but just not being able to pay your bills does n't mean you can go to jail of course there is very little protecting you from simply running out of money and becoming homeless but that 's not your question

ditto nate in many ways but let me add some other thoughts btw there are not four types of account but five you 're forgetting equity also called capital would it be possible to design an accounting system that does not have 5 types of accounts maybe is simpler in other ways and is internally consistent and logical i 'm sure it is but what 's the advantage   as nate points out the existing system has been in use for hundreds of years lots of people know how it works and understand it   i 'd add people have long since worked out how to deal with all the common situations and 99 of the odd cases you 're likely to hit if you invent your own system you 're starting from scratch you 'd have to come up with conventions to handle all sorts of situations how do i record buying a consumable with cash how do i record buying a capital asset with credit how do i record paying off debts how do i record depreciation etc etc if you worked at it long and hard enough and you 're a reasonably bright guy maybe you could come up with solutions to all the problems but why   if you were approaching this saying i see these flaws in the way accounting is done today i have an idea for a new better way to do accounting i 'd say good luck you have a lot of work ahead of you working out all the details to make a fully functioning system and then others to use it but if you really do have a better idea maybe you can revolutionize the world of accounting but the present system is too much trouble and i do n't want to bother to learn it i think that 's a mistake the work involved in inventing your own system is going to end up being way more than what it would take to learn the existing system as to are n't liabilities a lot like assets well in a sense i suppose a credit card is like a checking account in that you can use it to pay for things but they 're very different too from an accounting point of view with a checking account you buy something and then the money is gone so there 's one transaction reduce cash and increase office supplies or whatever but with a credit card there has to be a second transaction when you pay off the charge so step 1 increase debt and increase office supplies step 2 decrease debt and decrease cash credit cards charge interest well you do n't pay interest to use your own cash etc one of the of double entry book keeping is that every transaction involves a debit and a credit of equal amounts or a set of debits and credits where the total of the debits equals the total of the credits if you combine assets and liabilities into whatever you call it balance accounts say then some transactions would involve a matching debit and credit while others would involve a positive debit and a matching negative debit and no credit i 'm sure you could make such a system work but one of the neat built in protections against error is lost there 's a very logical distinction between things that you have or that others owe you and things that you owe to others it makes a lot of sense to want to list them separately and manage them separately i think you 'd pretty quickly find yourself saying well we have two types of balance accounts those that represent things we have and which normally have positive balances which we list on chart a and those that represent things we owe and which normally have negative balances which we list on chart b and before you know it you 've just assets and liabilities

i 'm posting this because i think i can do a better job of explaining and detailing everything from start to stop a broker is just someone who connect buyers and sellers a middleman of sorts who is easy to deal with there are many kinds of brokers the ones you 'll most commonly hear about these days are mortgage broker for arranging home loans and stockbroker the stockbroker helps you buy and sell stock the stockbroker has a connection to one or more stock exchanges e.g. nasdaq nyse and will submit your orders to them in order to fulfill it this way nasdaq and nyse do n't have to be in the business of managing millions of customer accounts and submitting tax information about those accounts to the government and what not they just manage relationships with brokerages which is much easier for them to invest in a stock you will need to in this day and age most brokers that you care about will be easily accessed via the internet the applications will be available on the internet and the trading interface will be over the internet there may also be paper and/or telephone interfaces to the brokerage but the internet interface will work better be aware that post ipo social media stock is risky do n't invest any money if you 're not prepared for the possibility of losing every penny of it also do n't forget that a variety of alternative things exist that you can buy from a broker such as an s&p 500 index fund or exchange traded corporate bond fund these will earn you some reward over time with significantly less risk if you do not already have similar holdings through a retirement plan you should consider purchasing some of these sooner or later

is investing a good idea with a low amount of money yes i 'll take the angle that you can invest in penny stocks there 's nothing wrong with that the oversimplified suggestion i would make is to answer the question about your risk aversion this is the four e.g.   you are introduced to when you first sit down to open your brokerage stocks or employer retirement account 401 k along with a release of liability in the language of past performance is not an indicator which you will not truly understand until you experience a market crash the reason i say this is because if you are 100 risk averse then it is clear which vehicles you want to have in your tool belt t bills cds money market and plain vanilla savings absolutely nothing wrong with this do n't let anyone make you feel otherwise with remarks like your money is not working for you sitting there it 's extremely important to be absolutely honest with yourself in doing this assessment too for example i thought i was a risk taker except when the market tumbled i reacted exactly how a knee jerk investor would also i feel it 's not easy to know just how honest you are with yourself as we are humans and not impartial machines so the recommendation i would give is to make a strong correlation to casino gambling in other words conventional advice is to only take play money to the casino this because you assume you will lose it then you can enjoy yourself at the casino knowing this is capital that you are okay throwing in the trash   i would strongly caution you to only ever invest capital in the stock market that you characterize as play money i 'm convinced financial advisors fund managers friends will disagree still i feel this is the only way you will be completely okay when the market fluctuates you wo n't lose sleep if you choose this approach then you can start investing any time that five drachma you were going to throw away on lottery tickets transfer it into your roth ira that twenty yen that you were going to ante in your weekly poker night transfer it into your index fund you already got past the investors remorse of losing that money if you truly accept that amount as play money then you can put it into penny stocks i 'll get lots of criticism here however i maintain that once you are truly okay with throwing that cash away like you would drop it into a slot machine then it 's the same whether you lose it one way or in another investment vehicle

everybody on the car title will need to participate in the selling process the person who is buying the car will need everybody to sign the paperwork so that nobody months later tries to say they never agreed to sell the car the money will have to be sent to the lender to pay off the rest of the loan if the money is n't enough to pay off the loan everybody will have to decide how the extra money will be sent to the lender this will have to be done as part of the selling process because the lender does n't want you to sell the car and keep the cash once the car is gone so is the collateral and they ca n't take it back if you miss payments   if the cousin is too far away to participate in the selling of the car you may need the buyer and the lender to tell you how to proceeded if you are selling at a dealership they will know what documents and signatures will be needed the bank will also know what to do if the loan is almost paid off it may be easier to pay the loan first and then get the title without the lenders name before trying to sell it

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

using a simple investment calculator to get a sense of scale here to have 70k total including the 500 a month invested after ten years you just need returns of 2   to earn 70k on top of the money invested you would need returns over 20   to do that in five years you would need over 50 annual return that is quite a big difference   annualized returns of 20 would require high risk and a very large amount of time invested skill and luck   2 returns can be nearly guaranteed without much effort i would encourage you to think about your money more if you get very unlucky with investments and do n't make any money will you not go on the vacations even if your income allows   that does n't make a lot of sense   as always spend all your money with the current and future in mind   investment return euros are no different from any other euros at that point the advice is the same for all investors try to get as much return as possible for the risk you are comfortable with   you seem to have a high tolerance for risk   generally for investors with a high risk tolerance a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks with maybe a small amount of bonds other investments will give the most return over the long term for the risk taken after that generally the next most useful way to boost your returns is to try to avoid taxes which is why we talk about 401(k)s so much around here   each european country has different tax law but please ask questions here about your own country as well as you mention could use more ex us questions

first of all i have to recognize up front that my spending personality is frugal i do n't recreational shop and i save a lot of my total income building a budget and sticking to it is difficult especially for people who are closer to living paycheck to paycheck than i. theoretically it should be easy to stick to a budget by overestimating expenses but for many people planning to spend more than necessary is n't a luxury available that said i have a system that works for me maybe it can work for you this system lets me see how much i have to spend and close to optimally arranges assets as you can see this system relies on some pretty strong upfront planning and adherence to the plan and what you might not realize is that you can deviate from the plan in two ways by spending variations and by timing variations credit should really help with a lot of the timing variations it takes a series of expenses and translates them into one lump payment every month   as for spending variations like spending 20 dollars for lunch when you only budgeted 5 it turns out this technique helps a lot some academic work suggests that spending with plastic is more likely to blow your budget than cash unless you make detailed plans but it sounds like your main problem is knowing whether you can afford to splurge and the future minimum balance of your checking account can be your splurge number

sure did for starters it 's important to note that many things that people label as public goods are not public goods roads and security services are not now if you 're talking about the air that we breathe and bodies of water then that is an issue for the legal system a man could own a section of a river that runs through his property and assuming that it was a clean river when he took ownership of it he would have the right to have that river be clean he can only it to the extent that it does n't hurt others downstream and he has a legal claim against any who would it from upstream   gt if private roads are so great why did n't private institutions come up with the national highway system   if state management of roads is so great why did they have to steal land from private individuals to create a national highway system if the benefits were so great they should have been able to articulate that to the people along said highway and not taken their land by force to directly answer your question because the private sector does n't come up with just anything and everything it comes up with things that are mutually beneficial   gt will you trust private security to enforce our laws how will you privatize the justice system   it 's not a matter of trust since i advocate a system of law but i would prefer a market based system of law because it would provide more flexibility for consumer preferences and reduce conflict there are videos that explain watch?v = and watch?v =   gt in your view what are the benefits of the profit motive behind private prisons   i actually do n't think that a private system of law would have a prison system like we have today i personally see little use for one at all but watch?v = is one theory on the market for a market based system of prisons

a dividend is a cash disbursement from the company   the value of the company goes down the same amount of the dividend so it is analogous to having money in a savings account and taking a withdrawal every month   obviously you are going to have less in the end than if you just kept the money in the account suppose that i own 10 different stocks and do n't reinvest dividends but keep them on account and each month or two as i add more money to invest either in one of my existing stocks or perhaps something new i add whichever dividend amount is currently available in cash to my new purchase would this strategy provide the same results roughly yes   reinvesting dividends is essentially buying more stock at the lower price which is a net zero effect in total balance   so if you invested in the same stocks yes you 'd be in the same place   if you invested in different stocks then you would have a performance difference depending on what you invested in the risk is the temptation to take the cash dividend and not reinvest it but take it in cash thereby reducing your earning power that is is there some particular reason that the brokers are recommending automatically reinvesting dividends as opposed to reinvesting them manually perhaps not always in the same item i 'd like to think that they 're looking after your best interest and they might be but the cynical part of me thinks that they 're either trying to keep your business by increasing your returns or there 's some uk regulation i 'm not aware of that requires them to disclose the effect of reinvesting dividends     £ 100 invested in the uk stock market since would have grown into just £ after adjusting for inflation this figure seems ludicrous to me   i have n't actually measured what the historical returns on the uk market are but that would mean an annualized return adjusted for inflation of just 0.5   either uk stocks pay a ridiculous amount of dividends or there 's something wrong with the math edit i still have not found a definitive source for the real uk market return but according to this inflation calculator £ 100 in would equate to almost £ 12,000 today for an average inflation rate of percent which would put the cagr of the uk market at about 4.9 which seems reasonable   the cagr with dividend reinvestment would then be about making dividend reinvestment a no brainer in the uk market at least

no kidding i 'm shocked /s   the flipper boom after the 2008 downturn basically means that anything affordable gets snapped up by an investor in a cash sale they do some half assed renovations and then turn and sell it for double the original price they out compete low end buyers during purchase even if those buyers have outstanding credit and then they move the house out of reach of those very buyers   $ 300k $ 600k houses are everywhere around here what is n't available are reasonably priced houses under $ 300k that might need some minor updating anything under that you can actually purchase is probably something barely above occupancy standards   there is no incentive to build or renovate affordable low end houses none

i was active in prosper when it started up it was very easy to get attracted to the high risk loans with big interest rates and i lost about 14 after all my loans ran their course there 's 10 still active but it wo n't change the figure by much prosper has wider standards than lending club so more borrowers with worse credit scores could ask for loans lenders could also set interest rates far lower so they could end up having loans with rates lower than the risk implied   this was set up with the idea of a free market where anyone could ask to borrow and anyone could loan money at whatever interest rate they wanted   it turns out a lot of lenders were not as smart as they thought they were aside it 's funny how people will for a free market but when they lose money will suddenly be against the free market they said they wanted this seems to apply to both individual p2p lenders up to massive multinational banks   since then prosper has tightened their standards on who can borrow and the interest rates are now fixed so i expect going forward it will be less easy to lose a bunch of money   the key is that one bad loan will erase the return of many good ones so it 's best to examine the loans carefully and stick with the high quality   simplified example if you have 10 1 yr loans of $ 100 each paying 10 interest year you get 10 return at the end of the year so $ 100 10 of $ 1000 but if one loan goes bad at the start you have lost money so a 90 success rate in picking borrowers leads to a loss you want to diversity over quite a few loans and you want to fund quality loans   i think really enjoyed investing through prosper because it gave me an insight into lending and loss ratios that i had not had before it also caused me to look at the banks with even more when the case of the no doc loans and am loans came to light

every company has capital even if you have a one man company you probably stated something like 100 shares of $ 1 each which means you had to take that $ 100 out of your own private pocket and pay it into the company   when the company loses money and runs out of cash they have the possibilities of 1 borrowing some money from the bank or from a loan shark 2 borrowing some money from the company owners or 3 increase the share capital for example by increasing the number of shares to 10,000 and each share holder pays his part of the $ 9,900 that 's the case that you have here   however it is only a liability in the sense that it is n't money the company earned it is money that the owners paid in they have no right to get the money back the paid in capital is actually what the owners lose if a limited company goes bankrupt

a technique that is working pretty well for me hide the money from myself i have two bank accounts at different banks let 's call them a and b. i asked my employer to send my salary into account a. furthermore i have configured an automatic transfer of money from account a to account b on the first of each month   i only use account b for all my expenses rent credit card food etc and i check its statement quite often since the monthly transfer is only 80 of my salary i save money each month in account a. i do n't have a credit card attached to the savings account and i almost never look at its statement since that money is out of sight i do not think much about it and i do not think that i could spend it i know it is a cheap trick but it works pretty well for me

looking at some large lotto games out there it seems that the lump sum cash option comes in at anywhere from about 50 to 70 percent of the jackpot amount sum of annual payouts typically over 20 to 30 years i 'm a fan of the phrase money today is better than money tomorrow   there 's no telling how laws will change taxes will change if inflation will skyrocket if you 'll die early if you or a family member will encounter a life changing event etc   by taking the lump sum option you trade a percentage of the winnings for the risk of the future unknowns   how much are those unknowns worth to you the tax implications are something else to consider   in your example of a small jackpot with $ 50,000 annual payouts it 's likely that you could still avoid the highest tax bracket each year whereas taking the lump sum would be taxed at the highest rate 35 of the amount above $ for a single filer in 2010   however this might not make much of a difference for large jackpots with higher annual payouts with the lump sum option you also have a greater potential of investment returns and losses since you can put all the money to work for you right away   it also allows you to purchase larger assets sooner if that 's something that interests you in the end i 'd say the reduced risk and the higher return potential of the lump sum option is well worth the reduced payout   i 'd also suggest not playing the lottery

retail is not in crisis in fact it in in a stage   you see the problem sears is facing and wal mart will face is the fact that the digital transformation is proving to be a jobs engine therefore meaning it will not stop   additionally you have the problem of selection wal mart sears kmart all use to work for busy busy americans in a up swinging economy   quick one stop shops that were often much cheaper then their local counter parts   this was achieved by using the same model that is now completely obsolete   that model paired large broad selection spanning multiple departments and categories   this model could never afford to display a full variety of products in any one category so it choose a selection of strong selling brands   it was all mass appeal   today more and more consumers want a bigger selection nicer cutting edge products and knowledge   additionally they want speed and convenience   nothing about this describes a wal mart which are usually located in between residential areas as opposed to strip malls which have into many suburban areas   same with sears   malls scream traffic and time and are usually located far away from main street and my street     want a true prediction   the death of sears is followed by a rapid decline in wal mart as kroger wal mart in reach and scale   grows across the landscape capitalizing on excess retail space   amazon splits into two with grocery pharmacy being a major piece of a new company and they continue to streamline your grocery visit   and last but not least main street   with the big department stores disappearing their competition will fill the void   best part of this scenario is the result in the economic market

the capital gains is counted towards your income if you cash out 1 million dollars you have a 1 million dollar income for that year which puts you at the 39.6 tax bracket however because that 1 million dollars is all long term capital gains you will only have to pay 20 of it in long term capital gains taxes the best you can do is to cash the 1 million dollars through several years instead of just all at once this will put in a lower tax bracket and thus will pay lower capital gains tax

gt;what makes you think anything would change if they allowed match money to be distributed tax free they are missing out on a future tax revenue opportunity   i agree that it 's highly unlikely that matching contributions would be made entirely tax free if anything i would expect employer contributions to be treated the same way that after tax non roth 401(k contributions are treated today to the extent that they exceed the new contribution limits it 's also possible that only individual contribution limits will be reduced and employer contribution limits will remain much higher i have n't seen any reporting on the latter   gt;i think the more likely way they would stick it to us is to sunset the roth 401(k all together and make plans go back to the old school pre tax and after tax only where even the earnings on after tax are taxed at distribution   i 'm optimistic that roth 401(k)s are here to stay trump 's priorities seem to be centered around short term budget characteristics with far less concern for the long term as is characteristic of populist administrations in general and eliminating roth 401(k)s would be unpopular and have a negligible impact on tax revenue in the short term

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money

ok looking at the balance sheet they have $ 42 m in cash but that is down from $ 325 m in december meanwhile their debt has increased from $ in december to $ as of june so their net cash has dropped by $ m in only 6 months it looks like they spent $ m give or take buying other companies in those 6 months otherwise their working capital an important measure of the ability to run the business looks ok at $ looking at the income statement they are making money $ m in the last quarter on revenue of $ m which is quite remarkable however they had an unusual item which increased earnings somewhat otherwise their earnings would have been about $ 39 m which is still pretty healthy   all in the company itself looks healthy and on a bit of a buying binge growing through acquisition i do n’t like the debt load but that is probably usual for the industry   when companies grow through acquisition they generally plan to reduce total employment because of redundancies because you sort of get economies of scale this usually factors into the decision to buy the company you increase revenues through the purchase and reduce costs by eliminating employees this is typically how they sell an acquisition to investors   if i was to guess and it would only be a guess this company has a team which looks at the employees of the company it just bought and decides where to downsize it may not downsize from the newly acquired company but from its own existing employees for a variety of reasons so most likely that is what you were a victim of it was n’t because the company was struggling or because you were necessarily not a good employee it is a process albeit sometimes unfair and you were a victim of it   the layoff decisions are not always prudent and it can be hard to understand why a particular group was cut instead of another one management does n’t always make the right call the broadcast industry has been going through consolidation companies buying companies for some time now most likely management is hoping to bulk up to make it harder for another company to buy it and/or to get a better price when it is bought    so in summary most likely they are doing this for reasons of greed ie they ’ll make more money with fewer employees sorry about your situation

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

afaik individual 401k accounts are supposed to be funded from self employment earnings not from rollovers from 401k plans of previous employers so check with your accountant before making opening an individual 401k account and getting your previous 401k plan to re issue the checks to be payable to your individual 401k account you might also want to ask about whether loans are permitted from individual 401k accounts my guess is they are not because the possibility of abuse of the privilege is too high since the employer and employee are the same individual   in any case loans against 401k plans are generally not a good idea and many people on this forum have about this matter

there is a possibility of misuse hence it should be shared sharing it with large trusted organization reduces the risk as there would be right process controls in place broadly these days pan and other details are shared for quite a few transactions say applying for a credit card opening bank account taking a phone connection etc in most of the cases the application is filled out and processed by 3rd party rather than the service provider directly   creating fake employee records is a possibility so is the misuse to create a fake bank account in your name and transact in that account since one can not totally avoid sharing pan details to multiple parties it helps to stay vigilant by monitoring the form from the govt website any large cash transactions additional salary or other noteworthy transactions are shown here it would also help to monitor your reports that show all the credit card and other details under your name

the advantage of having a mortgage rather than borrowing money in other ways is that it is cheaper because the loan is secured against the value of the property   if you stop paying then the bank take the house and can sell it keeping what they are owed and returning any excess if you have enough money to pay it off then you do not need the mortgage   they normally run for 25 years   it is a lovely day when finally you realise that you own the whole house and no longer owe anything to the bank and the charge against the house is removed and the record of it removed from the land registry    when you sell a house with a mortgage the buyer has to check that the bank has been paid off before they accept the property

i respectfully disagree with @johnfx 's comment regarding new vs used   john knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations the answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small loud cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years if you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now then a new car can be a fine choice   i just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 hyundai and a comparable 2012 hyundai was n't much   furthermore it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market   doing math in my head told me the reduced usage i will get out of the car was n't offset by the slightly lower price depending on the specific age insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars but you have to have carry more insurance so consider that as well   there might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012 but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013 new cars can be cheaper to operate   lower fuel costs better safety and possibly pollution costs   they are tuned up and you know everything about their history repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car so if you car turns out to be a problem your out of pocket is limited these programs do n't mean anything   get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy   if the dealer wo n't let you get the car checked out then they are n't worth your business   certified cars do n't justify their cost according to consumer reports they are more for marketing than reliability do n't waste money on a third party warranty   either the car is good and does n't need it or it needs a warranty and you should n't buy it   if you new car comes with a factory warranty that is fine   radio host clark howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately but never a third party just out of college you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car if for no other reason this likely is n't going to be your car in the near future   only you can answer that if you have a feeling you wo n't keep your tiny car well into your 30s then definitely do n't buy a new car    also my experience only applies to my make and model   certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used is n't much for the most recent model years but there are many more makes and models that do n't pan out that way
