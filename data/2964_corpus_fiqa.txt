despite the unmarried status you need to see a lawyer   essentially you have a business with this person owning a home as the asset and a mortgage for which you are responsible for   a lawyer needs to examine any paperwork you have and with knowledge of your particular jurisdiction 's laws can advise you on the proper course of action you paint a really ugly picture of this guy   i bet you are correct that he is kind of a horrible person   tough love time   you willingly entered into a long term contract with this person   why would you do such a thing   perhaps some self reflection and counseling is in order   this is probably more important than worrying about your credit all that being said it is good of you to want to break ties with this person   you can rebuild   all will be good if you concentrate on the right things

because you 're not married its a partnership agreement and unless there 's a written contract either the two of you agree on how to handle the home or it 's off to court you go if you were both supposed to pay for the home and he failed to for a a while that would put him in breach of contract which i would think gives you a good position in court on the other hand if you are at all concerned about your safety from this remember he knows exactly where the house is

it is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term   the amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves for example replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss   if cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled this policy can be expected to be stable however cash is normally scarce   it is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured

why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years because the rate is not the same never that i 've seen in my 30 years of following rates i 've seen the rate difference range from .25 to .75 in march 15 the average rate in my area is 30yr 3.75 15yr 3.00 for a $ 150 k loan this puts the 15yr payment at $ with the 30 at higher rate paid in 15 years at $ 1091 this $ 55 difference can be considered a flexibility premium as it offers the option to pay the actual $ in any period the money is needed elsewhere   if the rate were the same i 'd grab the 30 and since i ca n't say invest the difference i 'd say to pay at a pace to go 15 unless you had a cash flow situation a spouse out of work an emergency that you funded with a high interest rate loan etc the advice to have an emergency fund is great until for whatever reason there 's just not enough   on a personal note i did go with the 15 year mortgage for our last refinance i was nearing 50 at the time and it seemed prudent to aim for a mortgage free retirement

the amount you are earning in the savings account is insignificant since you would only have the money in the account for 1 month after purchasing the car   the instant 1.5 cashback or travel mile reward on the other hand can be significant however it is not normal for a car dealership to allow you to put $ 16k on a credit card   the reason is that the fees that the dealer has to pay to process your credit card would be too burdensome   car dealers have a much smaller profit margin on their sales than a typical retail store so if the dealer has to pay 3 or 4 of the sales price in credit card fees it just eats up too much of their profit if the dealer does allow you to put the entire purchase price on a credit card be aware that they have already factored in their processing fees into the price   you might be able to get a better than 1.5 discount by offering to pay with cash instead

there are two ways that an asset can generate value   one is that the asset generates some revenue e.g. you buy a house for $ 100,000 and rent it out for $ 1,000 per month and the second way is that the asset appreciates e.g you buy a house for $ 100,000 you do n't rent it out and 5 years later you sell it for $ 200,000   stocks are the same

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

you need a good erp or at least ii implementation which means you need someone very familiar with or someone who becomes very familiar with your business to get it done right   those do n't come setup for some unique business as an off the shelf thing and while many are customizable you can easily end up in customization hell both dollar wise operation interruption wise and technical wiki   but this really begs for someone to ask why are you not maintaining amp updating your existing custom software   why attempt to ditch something that is hopefully working fairly well for the highly risky prospect of some entirely new untested system     is the business logic and the operation of the old system working well   while it might seem to be costly in terms of time amp money your best bet in my experience would be to get a really good programmer possibly with a cheap assistant temp helper to do some grunt work for him to document maintain and then slowly upgrade your current already in place software and/or rewrite it to use modern db 's web interfaces etc    because changing out your system is like replacing all the and in your body it will not be a pleasant experience and the patient may not survive the operation even if the implementation is a labeled a success the business is littered with the of erp victims   the big dogs have three huge upfront cost areas 1 the consultants in various teams stages 2 the underlying database software costs initial licenses 3 the ongoing licenses 4 the ongoing customization fixes if you ever want to upgrade alas most of the consultants who do customizations do n't do document it in a way that facilitates easy upgrades in part because that would significantly reduce their income

it is unusual to need a consultant to open a bank account for you and i would also be concerned that perhaps the consultant could take the money and do nothing or continue to demand various sums of money for expenses like permits licenses identity check etc   until you give up     some of the more accepted ways to open a bank account are a call up an established bank and follow their instructions to open a personal account make sure you are calling on a real bank one that has been around a while hints has permanent locations in the local phone book and has shares traded on a national stock exchange   call the bank directly do n't use a number given to you by a 3rd party consultant as it may be a trick discuss on the phone and find out if you can open an account by mail or if you need to visit in person   b create a company or branch office in the foreign country assuming this is for business or investing    and open an account by appointing someone like a lawyer or accountant or similar professional in the foreign country to represent the company to open an account in person   if you are a us citizen you will want to ask your cpa accountant tax lawyer about the td f 90 22.1 foreign account bank report form and the fatca foreign account tax compliance act there can be very large fines for not making the required reports    the requirements to open a bank account have become more strict in many countries so do n't be surprised if they will not open an account for a foreigner with no local address if that is your situation

dollar cost averaging is a method of regularly investing money as it is available   for example $ 100 from each paycheck   it has been shown to bet better on average than collecting the money and investing it all at once   it is not intended to be used when you have the entire amount up front   see this link dollar cost averaging a lump sum would only be beneficial if the market was just as likely to go up as is to go down   since over time the market historically has always gone up your best bet is to invest all of your money right away   anything else is just trying to time the market

i have been renting rooms out of my house for over 7 years now   when renting to non family the arrangement is usually successful   people leave for various reasons an occasionally i will ask someone to move out if they are not working out   in the usa this works well because by keeping things formal rental agreements etc you actually have a great business with lots of deductions that end up reducing you net income quite a bit however us law makes a big distinction about whether or not you 're renting to family relatives specifically around whether or not they are paying full market rent for their room   if not then you are subsidizing them which could disqualify your property or at least the portion they are using from being legitimately rented and thus no tax deductions for said activity the other risk again in the usa is the possibility of a long term relationship falling under rules of common law marriage   this is rare unless children are involved   a couple who have children married or not may have the courts get involved to oversee the division of assets with regards to ensuring the children have a place to live and adequate financial support for the uk i would think the laws would be roughly similar   check out this website for more a detailed review

with interest rates as low as they are you could lock in to a very low rate for 30 years if rates are higher in say 10 years you could conceivably be earning a much higher rate on the money you 're not putting towards monthly payments all else equal the payments will be lower on a 30y than they will be on a 10y so you 'll have more cash for other things but i 'm just looking for downsides being paid off in 10 years versus 30 sounds nice to me

any way you look at it this is a terrible idea cars lose value   they are a disposable item that gets used up   the more expensive the car the more value they lose if you spend $ 100,000 on a new car in four years it will be worth less than $ 50,000   that is a lot of money to lose in four years in addition to the loss of value you will need to buy insurance which for a $ 100,000 car is incredible if your heart is set on this kind of car you should definitely save up the cash and wait to buy the car   do not get a loan   here is why your plan has you saving $ 1,300 a month $ 16,000 a year for 6.5 years before you will be able to buy this car   that is a lot of money for a long range goal   if you faithfully save this money that long and at the end of the 6.5 years you still want this car it is your money to spend as you want   you will have had a long time to reconsider your course of action but you will have sacrificed for a long time and you will have the money to lose   however you may find out a year into this process that you are spending too much money saving for this car and reconsider if instead you take out a loan for this car then by the time you decide the car was too much of a stretch financially it will be too late   you will be upside down on the loan and it will cost you thousands to sell the car so go ahead and start saving   if you have n't given up before you reach your goal you may find that in 6.5 years when it is time to write that check you will look back at the sacrifices you have made and decide that you do n't want to simply blow that money on a car consider a different goal   if you invest this $ 1300 a month and achieve 8 growth you will be a millionaire in 23 years you do n't need to take my word for it   look at the car you are interested in go to select the 2012 version of the car and look up the private sale value   you 'll most likely see a price that is about half of what a new one costs

i think this is really two questions dumbcoder has already answered part 1 in a comment either just wire the money from the japanese bank account to the uk bank account either bank should be able to help you with the details of this or if your bank also has a uk operation you may be able to do it within the same bank   as for part 2 if you are looking for a mortgage then many high street mortgage providers banks will want proof of your savings up front they may or may not accept japanese bank statements all you can do is ask the question you would probably also need to ask your japanese bank if they can provide statements in english   if you find that most or all of the high street banks will not accept this as proof of assets or that they demand that the money is in the uk for a period of time first then you might have more luck with a mortgage broker who can deal with the specialist requirement if you do find a mortgage provider who is happy to accept japanese bank statements as proof of assets then you would simply need to wire the money direct from your bank in japan to the uk bank of your solicitor at or shortly before the point when the deposit becomes due usually at exchange of contracts

one reason a lot of bond etfs like financials are because of how financial companies work   they usually have amazing cash flows due to deposits and fees and therefore have little risk associated with paying their debts in the short term the rest of contains companies with low default risk and good cash flow generation as well this is of course the objective of banks themselves issue a lot of bonds to raise cash to lend for other purposes   banks are intermediary and help make funds liquid for investors and spenders   hope that helped answer your question   if not comment below and i 'll try to adjust the answer to be more complete

you remind me a lot of myself as i was thinking about marriage luckily for me my wife was much smarter about all this than i was hopefully i can pass along some of her wisdom both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other in marriage there is no more financial independence do not think in those terms life can throw so many curve balls that you will regret it imagine sitting down with your new bride and running through the math she is to contribute $ x to the family each month and you are to contribute $ y. then next thing you know 6 months later she has cancer and has to undergo expensive and debilitating treatment there is no way she can contribute her $ x anymore you tell her that is okay and that you understand but the pressure weighs down on her every day because she feels like she is not meeting your expectations   or alternatively everything goes great with your $ x $ y plan a few years down the road your wife is pregnant so you revisit the plan readjust etc everything seems great when your child is born however the baby has a severe physical or mental handicap you and your wife decide that she will quit her job to raise your beautiful child but the whole time in the back of her mind she ca n't get out of her head that she is no longer financially independent and not living up to your expectations these stresses are not what you want in your marriage here is what we do in my family hopefully some of this will be helpful to you every year my wife and i sit down and determine what our financial goals are for the year how much do we want to be putting in retirement how much do we want to give to charity do we want to take any family vacations we set goals together on what we want to achieve with our money there is no my money or her money just ours does n't matter where it comes from at the beginning of every month we create a budget in a spreadsheet it has categories like food mortgage or rent transportation clothing utilities and we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those it also has categories for entertainment retirement charity cell phones internet and so on again we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those in the spreadsheet we also track how much income we expect that month and our totals income minus expenses if that value is positive we determine what to do with the remainder maybe we save some for a rainy day or for car repairs maybe we treat ourselves to an extra fancy dinner the point is every dollar should be accounted for if she wants to go to dinner with some friends we put that in the budget if i want a new video game we put that in the budget once a week we take all our receipts and tally up where we spent our money we then see how we are doing on our budget maybe we were a little high in one category and lower than expected in another we adjust we are flexible but we go over our finances often to make sure we are achieving our goals some specific goals i 'd recommend that the two of you consider in your first such yearly meeting you get out of life what you put into it and you will get out of your finances what the two of you put into them by being on the same page your marriage will be much happier money finances are one of the top causes of divorce if you two are working together on this you are much more likely to succeed

gt;during the dot com boom tons of people with liberal arts degrees and no experience wound up as software engineers not all of them sucked but many did and the dot com crash sorted that out as an engineer i saw this first hand and it was n't a bad thing i had a lot of co workers in 2000 who were n't pulling their weight this is going to sound heartless and maybe it is but if someone has been unemployed 3 years maybe it is time for a career change   this was what i 'm arguing about not the economics of the situation you make the argument that it is not a bad thing because their skills were lacking but that is n't the case with the receptionists and this is not just one branch that is suffering i think its a terrible thing that has little to do with the skills of people and the right career path   when there are no jobs or very little jobs being unemployed for 3 years is hell and considering a career change it not as simple as you make it sound

i was not able to find any authority for the opinion you suggest wash sale rules should imho apply according to the regulations you attribute the newly purchased shares to the oldest sold shares for the purposes of the calculation of the disallowed loss and cost basis c where the amount of stock or securities acquired within the period is less than the amount of stock or securities sold or    otherwise disposed of then the particular shares of stock or    securities the loss from the sale or other disposition of which is not    deductible shall be those with which the stock or securities acquired    are matched in accordance with the following rule the stock or    securities acquired will be matched in accordance with the order of    their acquisition beginning with the earliest acquisition with an    equal number of the shares of stock or securities sold or otherwise    disposed of you can resort to the claim that you have not in fact entered into the contract within 30 days but when you gave the instructions to reinvest dividends i do n't know if such a claim will hold but to me it sounds reasonable this is similar to the rules re short sales in g there in this case wash sale rules will not apply unless you instructed to reinvest dividends within the 30 days prior to the sale but i 'd ask a tax professional if such a claim would hold talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state

fortunately this can be solved by simply going to the website unfortunately the website is not very well designed so it took a while to find it however looking at the section about entering your own meter reading in it is clear that this is indeed a credit meaning they owe you money   notice how the costs break down   they estimated an energy usage cost equivalent of Â£ which resulted in a bill of Â£ credit   then the customer entered a meter reading which resulted in an actual energy usage cost equivalent of Â£   since it was Â£ higher it went from a credit to a debit of Â£    were Â£ credit to mean money was owed to they would owe a bit over Â£ 68 instead given the higher energy charges you can see this help page to inquire about getting a refund or simply allow this to carry over to your next bill   or consider doing a self entered meter reading if one has n't been done recently to make sure that any actual excessive usage comes out of your credit rather than being a shock at one time

to understand the twist you need to understand what the yield curve is   you must also understand that the price of debt is inverse to the interest rate so when the price of bonds or notes or bills rises that means the current price goes up and the yield to maturity has gone down   currently early 2012 the short term rate is low close to zero the tools the fed uses setting short term rates for one is exhausted as their current target is basically zero for this debt but my mortgage is based on 10yr rates not 1 yr or 30 day money the next step in the fed 's effort is to try to pull longer term rates down by buying back 10 year notes in this quantity the fed impacts the yield at that point on the curve buying remember supply demand pushes the price up and for debt a higher price equates to lower yield to raise the money to do this they will sell short term debt these two transactions effectively try to twist the curve to pull long term rates lower and push the economy

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

i put about that down on my place   i could have purchased it for cash but since my investments were returning more interest than the loan was costing me much easier to achieve now this was one of the safest possible ways of making leverage work for me i could have put less down and increased the leverage but was what i felt most comfortable with definitely make enough of a down payment to avoid mortgage insurance you may want to make enough of a down payment that the bank trusts you to handle your property insurance and taxes yourself rather than insisting on an escrow account and building that into the loan payments i trust myself to mail the checks on time much more than i trust the bank beyond that it 's very much a matter of personal preference and what else you might do with the money

first the obvious business school rankings are flawed    i have no doubt that asian business schools are improving rapidly and many are already on par with western universities many of the best teachers at us european schools are also teaching in asia i have never had an asian teacher but i expect that they are as great as their western counterparts also academic journals accept more and more asian submissions    but we also have to put the numbers in perspective an american student who did an mba in china will have a hard time getting a job in the us even those who go to european universities are met by recruiters with so these the high ranking of asian schools is really only relevant for asian students    in short what the ranking says is if you 're chinese you do n't need to go to the us or europe for your business degree personally i suggest you still do if you can afford it because the experience abroad and the exposure to students with a different attitude will be an enrichment

there is not necessarily a need to prevent what you describe turning insurance on before high risk situations they just need to calculate the premiums accordingly for example if an insurance needs to take for insuring your house against flood and a flood happens in average every 10 years if you just insure the two weeks in the ten years where heavy rain is predicted you might pay 500 $ for the two weeks the total is the same for the insurance they get 500 $ and you get insurance for the dangerous period in the contrary if a flooding unexpectedly happens outside your two weeks they are out from the home owners view 500 $ for two weeks when heavy rains and floods are expected and nothing otherwise sounds pretty good compared to 50 $ every year it is the same of course but psychology works that way

you still owe the money because there is a high probability that some other organization the account and assets of the failed creditor   that means they will have bought your debt   i have to assume there is language in your note that explains that they might sell your debt but what should one do if they do n't know who bought the entity   you ca n't pay a non existent entity but if you do n't have an address how can you pay the new owner of the debt first step is to assume there will be a new owner   a government a company an individual somebody will buy that debt   read the news and see if you ca n't figure out what other entity owns your note   you might have to contact them to enquire about where to send payment   keep records of any such contact if you put in an honest effort but just can not figure out who owns your note i 'd suggest continuing to make regular on time payments   but put your payments into a new bank account that you open just for this purpose   so when the new owner of the debt does come calling you 'll have reasonable proof you were attempting to pay   you simply settle up from the special account   any reasonable company will just take the money and if anybody gets unreasonable and you have to appear in court you have a paper trail indicating your attempts to honour the debt you 'd have to consult a lawyer if nobody comes asking for the money   there are probably statutes of limitation but i would n't count on that ever happening

when banks would return the actual physical cheque at least you had some printing writing from the other bank on it as some type of not easily proof now many most banks do n't return the actual cheques anyway just an image of it sometimes a low quality photocopy like image too   you 'd have to check with a lawyer or court in your area but i suspect any photocopy or image as well as a written or carbon copy duplicate would not be good enough proof for a law court since they could all be easily re written or so i do n't think there 's a real upside anyway only an official bank statement saying that the name people written actually cashed the cheque might be good evidence i 'm having doubts that the bank 's own low quality image would even qualify unless it 's verified as coming directly from the bank somehow i 'd agree with nate + 1 that a big downside could be identity theft either online or alongside phone loss theft

you need to understand how various entities make their money once you know that you can determine whether their interests are aligned with yours for example a full service broker makes money when you buy and sell stocks they therefore have in interest in you doing lots of buying and selling not in making you money or no fee financial advisors make their money through commissions on what they sell you which means their interests are served by selling you those investments with high commissions not the investments that would serve you best financial media makes their money through attracting viewers readers and selling advertising that is their business and they are not in the business of giving good advice there are lots of good investments index funds are a great example that do n't get much attention because there is n't any money in them   in fact the majority of wall street is not aligned with your interests so be skeptical of the financial industry in general   there are for fee financial advisors who you pay directly their interests are fairly well aligned with yours there is a fair amount of good information at the motley fool

you can split payments and nobody judges you because most prepaid cards are actually gift cards   they just think you have generous friends    when you use visa mc at a vendor they get dinged around 2 3 plus 35 cents flat rate   so when you ask them to charge 77 cents to the card you 're essentially asking they give half of it to visa mc   which is unfair   a charity wo n't turn it down but it 's wasted   so how do you solve this problem   if you see a small merchant using square or paypal here their merchant agreements charge a flat rate 2.75 and respectively with no flat rate per transaction   if you see they are on paypal square go for it    obviously paypal itself does n't have that problem because they have a really really good deal with visa and mastercard   so feel free to buy yourself credit on your paypal account with these residual values    amazon probably has a similar deal    you are getting these small amounts because you aim to pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 25 on it   reasonable but it causes this    flip it around pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 20 on it consume the $ 20 value and pay the $ in cash   you may need to tell the cashier exactly the amount to charge e.g. $ 20.00 especially if it is a visa mc card   it will certainly go faster if you do   the cashier may be able to pull up the balance but it 's an extra procedure and an inexperienced cashier may struggle with it have to call the manager etc not worth it in my book

the coupon should save you $ 10 either way assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon you 're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone   you should be including the tip in your calculations yes they 're tacking on something that is otherwise optional but that 's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there 's a coupon involved or not   so restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up i guess it gets down to how much you tip   if you typically do n't tip which would be rather then yes you do lose money with a $ 60 meal   if you tip 18 then you save exactly $ 10 $ $ 10.00 = $   if you normally tip 10 15 a customary range then it 's somewhere in between edit following littleadv 's discussion on this question i am assuming that the 18 goes directly to the and is more or less expected if it does n't in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner then you 're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18 as a tax

technically there could be a true cash fund but the issue is it would need to have some sort of cost associated with it which would mean it would have negative yield or would charge a fee   in some cases this might be preferable to having it invested in cash equivalents which as you note are not cash   it is important to note that there is nothing even cash or physical precious metals that is considered zero risk   they all just have different risks associated with them that may be an issue under certain circumstances   in severe deflation cash is king and all non cash asset classes and debt could go down in value   under severe inflation cash can become worthless one mentioned an alternative of stopping contributing to a 401k and depositing money in a bank but that is not the same as cash either   in recent decades people have been led to believe that depositing your money in the bank means you hold that in cash at the bank   that is untrue   they hold your deposit on their books and proceed to invest loan that money but those investments can turn sour in an economic and financial downturn   the same financial professionals would then remind you that while this is true there is the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic that will make you whole should the bank go under   unfortunately if enough banks went under due to lack of reserves the fdic may be unable to make depositors whole for lack of reserves   in fact they were nearing this during the last financial crisis   the sad thing is that the financial industry is bias against offering what you said because they make money by using your money   fractional reserve banking   you are essentially holding ious from your bank when you have money on deposit with them getting back to the original question you could do some searching and see if there is an institution that would act as a cash depository for physical cash in your ira   there are ira approved ways of holding physical precious metals which is n't all too different of a concept from holding physical cash 401k plans are chosen by your company and often have very limited options available meaning it 'd be unlikely you could ever hold physical cash or physical precious metals in your 401k

so a interesting note is that this does n't seem to take into account cost of living arbitrage or investments the reason it 's so good to make that money is n't so you can spend it on sports cars and cheap read expensive women if you invest you can put away like 50k year which will probably net you at least 5 return per year more if you 're risky so you make 100k for like 5 years put away 250k and get like 20k from doing nothing

you must file as married for 2013 if you were married as of december 31 2013 it is true that the roth ira contribution phaseout for married filing separately is 0 $ 10k. but you can still do backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then convert it to a roth ira assuming you do not have any pre tax iras this is identical to a roth ira contribution but you already made a roth ira contribution for 2013 and did not do the backdoor let 's assume that you want to turn it into a backdoor roth ira contribution and that you do n't have any pre tax iras there are two ways to do this withdraw the roth ira you contributed including earnings then do a normal backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then immediately convert it to roth ira the earnings you had in the roth ira that you withdrew will be treated as normal income and taxed the conversion will not be taxable because all of the traditional ira was non deductible when you converted re characterize your original roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution then convert it to roth ira it will be treated as if you made a traditional ira contribution originally and then waited until now to convert the earnings in the ira up till now will be taxed on conversion so in both cases you will need to pay income tax on the earnings in the account up to now the difference between the two is in the amount of money in the ira now with the first way you can only contribute $ 5500 now with the second way you will keep the same amount of money you have in the ira now

the offering price is what the company will raise by selling the shares at that price   however this is n't usually what the general public sees as often there will be shows to drive up demand so that there will be buyers for the stock   that demand is what you see on the first day when the general public can start buying the stock   if one is an employee relative or friend of someone that is offered friends and family shares they may be able to buy at the offering price pricing of ipo from wikipedia states around the idea of pricing a company planning an ipo typically appoints a lead manager known as    a to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the    shares should be issued there are two primary ways in which the price    of an ipo can be determined either the company with the help of its    lead managers fixes a price fixed price method or the price can    be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data    compiled by the book building historically some ipos both globally and in the united states have    been underpriced the effect of initial underpricing an ipo is to    generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes    publicly traded flipping or quickly selling shares for a profit can    lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares    of the ipo at the offering price however underpricing an ipo results    in lost potential capital for the issuer one extreme example is    ipo which helped fuel the ipo mania of the late 90 's    internet era underwritten by bear stearns on november 13 1998 the    ipo was priced at $ 9 per share the share price quickly increased    1000 after the opening of trading to a high of $ 97 selling pressure    from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down and    it closed the day at $ 63 although the company did raise about $ 30    million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of    demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the    company might have left upwards of $ 200 million on the table the danger of is also an important consideration if a    stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will    pay the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to    sell shares even if they sell all of the issued shares the stock may    fall in value on the first day of trading if so the stock may lose    its and hence even more of its value this could result    in losses for investors many of whom being the most favored clients    of the underwriters perhaps the best known example of this is the    facebook ipo in 2012 underwriters therefore take many factors into consideration when    pricing an ipo and attempt to reach an offering price that is low    enough to stimulate interest in the stock but high enough to raise an    adequate amount of capital for the company the process of determining    an optimal price usually involves the underwriters syndicate    arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional    investors some researchers e.g. c. and c. swift 2009 believe that    the underpricing of ipos is less a deliberate act on the part of    issuers and/or underwriters than the result of an over reaction on    the part of investors swift 2009 one potential method    for determining underpricing is through the use of ipo underpricing    algorithms this may be useful for seeing the difference in that example where the offering price is $ yet the stock traded much higher than that initially

strictly by the numbers putting more than 20 down is a losing proposition   with interest rates still near all time lows you 're likely able to get a mortgage for less than 4 the real rate of a return on the market subtracting inflation and taxes is going to be somewhere around 5 6   so by this math you 'd be best off paying the minimum to get out of pmi and then investing the remainder in a low fee index fund the question becomes how much that 1 2 is worth to you vs how much the job flexibility is worth it boils down to your personal risk preference life conditions etc so it is difficult to give good advice   the 1 2 difference in your rate of return is not going to be catastrophic     personally i would run the numbers with your fiance   build a spreadsheet tracking your estimated net worth under the assumption that you make a 20 down payment and invest the rest   then hold all other factors equal and re build the spreadsheet with the higher down payment   factor in one of you losing your job for a few years or one of you taking off for a while to raise the kids    you can make a judgement call based how the two of you feel about those numbers

a good question there are many good tactical points in other answers but i wanted to emphasize two strategic points to think about in your 5-year plan both of which involve around diversification expense allocation you have several potential expenses actually expenses is n't the right word it 's more like applications think of the money you have as a resource that you can pour because money has liquidity into multiple buckets depending on time horizon and risk tolerance an ultra short term cushion for extreme emergencies e.g.   things go really wrong this should be something you can access at a moment 's notice from a bank account for example your car has been and they need cash a short term cushion for emergencies something bad happens and you need the money in a few days or weeks a cd ladder is good for this it pays better interest and you can get the money out quick with a minimal penalty a long term savings cushion you might want to make a down payment on a house or a car but you know it 's some years off for this an investment account is good there are quite a few index funds out there which have very low expenses and will get you a better return than cds savings account with some risk tolerance retirement savings $ 1 now can be worth a huge amount of money to you in 40 years if you invest it wisely here 's where the ira or 401 k if you get a job comes in you need to put these in this order of priority put enough money in your short term to be 99 confident you have enough then with the remainder put most of it in an investment account but some of it in a retirement account the thing to realize is that you need to make the retirement account off limits so you do n't want to put too much money there but the earlier you can get started in a retirement account the better i 'm 38 and i started both an investment and a retirement account at age 24 they 're now to the point where i save more income on average from the returns in my investments than i can save from my salary but i wish i had started a few years earlier income you need to come up with some idea of what your range of net income after living expenses is likely to be over the next five years so that you can make decisions about your savings allocation are you in good health or bad are you single or do you have a family are you working towards law school or medical school and need to borrow money are you planning on getting a job with a dependable salary or do you plan on being self employed where there is more uncertainty in your income these are all factors that will help you decide how important short term and long term savings are to your 5-year plan in short there is no one place you should put your money but be smart about it and you 'll give yourself a good head start in your personal finances good luck

an instant 15 profit sounds good to me so you ca n't go wrong selling as soon as you are able here are a couple other considerations tax implications when you sell the stock you have to pay taxes on the profit including that 15 discount the tax rate you pay is based on how long you wait to sell it if you wait a certain amount of time usually 2 years but it will depend on your specific tax codes before you sell you could be subject to lower tax rates on that profit see here for a more detailed description this might only apply if you 're in the us since you work for the company you may be privy to a bit more information about how the company is run and how likely it is to grow as such if you feel like the company is headed in the right direction you may want to hold on the the stock for a while   i am generally wary of being significantly invested in the company you work for if the company goes south then the stock price will obviously drop but you 'll also be at risk to be laid off as such you 're exposed much more risk than investing in other companies this is a good argument to sell the stock and take the 15 profit   i realize your question was n't really about whether to sell the stock but more for when but i felt this was relevant nonetheless

i 'd start by asking yourself why you need a business plan is it for you or for raising funds   if it 's for you i 'd distinguish between writing a business plan and business planning not the same thing there are much more time efficient ways to do the latter such as business model generation and customer development   if you 're fund raising the content of your plan will depend on if you 're seeking investment or bank loans being clear about the purpose of your plan and the stage of your business will help people better answer your question

no it wo n't go on the front page because it uses bullshit math and reveals a deep lack of understanding of how the numbers are calculated the unemployment rate is calculated from the current population survey as well as the participation rate to add to the unemployment rate of one month survey by calculating the participation rate from a different month survey is very problematic   if you are looking to include those who have stopped looking for a job because of poor job prospects you could try using the unemployment estimate the number includes those who have recently stopped looking for a job it only goes back a year for the respondents but at least it is comparable because it is in the same month survey   the author also states that the u6 unemployment estimate should be 20 without explaining why it can be calculated like that i do n't think the participation rate can be used to suggest that the u6 is higher than it is when the u6 already takes into account a large percent of those that have stopped looking for economic reasons

i had an hsa for two or three years i found very routinely that my insurance company had negotiated rates with in network providers so as i never hit the deductible i always had to pay 100 of the negotiated rate but it was still much less than the providers general rate sometimes dramatically so like i had some blood and urine tests done and the general rate was $ 450 but the negotiated rate was only $ 40 i had laser eye surgery and the general rate was something like $ 1500 but the negotiated rate was more like $ 500 et cetera other times it was the same or trivially different like routine office visits it made no difference i found that i could call the insurance company and ask for the negotiated rate and they would tell me when i asked the doctor or the hospital they either could n't tell me or they would n't it 's possible that the doctor 's office does n't really know what rates they 've agreed to they might have just signed some contract with the insurance company that says yes we 'll accept whatever you give us but either way i had to go to the insurance company to find out you 'd think they 'd just publish the list on a web site or something after all it 's to the insurance company 's advantage if you go to the cheapest provider with a regular non hsa plan they 're share of the total is less even with an hsa plan if you go to a cheaper provider you are less likely to hit the deductible yes medical care in the u.s. is rather bizarre in that providers routinely expect you to commit to paying for their services before they will tell you the price can you imagine any other industry working this way can you imagine buying a car and the dealer saying i have no idea what this car costs if you like it great take it and drive it home and in a few weeks we 'll send you a bill and of course whatever amount we put on that bill you are legally obligated to pay but we refuse to tell you what that amount will be the american medical association used to have a policy that they considered it unethical for doctors to tell patients the price of treatment in advance i do n't know if they still do

for allocation there 's rules of thumb is the percentage some folks recommend for stock market high risk allocation   with the balance in bonds and a bit of international fund to add some more diversity   however everyone needs to determine how much risk they 're willing to take and what their horizon is once you figure out your allocation determine how much of your surplus goes into investing and how much goes into short term savings for your short term financial goals such as purchasing a home i would highly recommend reading about financial independence retire early fire   most of the articles i 've seen on it were folks in the us with the odd canadian and brit but the principles should be able to work in the netherlands with adjustment    the idea behind fire is that you adjust your lifestyle to minimize expenses and save as much of your income as possible   when the growth of your savings is > the amount you spend on a yearly basis you 've reached financial independence and can retire any time you wish cd ladder is a good idea for your emergency fund but cds at least in the us usually pay around the same rate as inflation give or take   a ladder would help you preserve your emergency fund

washington post 's website is cancer shame on whoever decided that was a good way to run a website looks like a website from the 90 's complete with ads and anti nonsense but anyway   i like how the article cites bill gross he is the star of one of my favorite stories in recent financial history in 2011 during the debt ceiling madness the s&amp;p downgraded the us credit rating in an unprecedented move because they felt there was too much political turmoil for us to pay our debts on time bill gross was the manager of pimco 's fixed income fund at the time the largest bond fund in the world i do n't know how much but probably hundreds of billions aum gross was and still is one of the world 's leading experts on fi securities when the credit rating was cut he predicted investors would flee from riskier us debt he basically sold the entire fund 's considerable holdings of us treasuries and to cash     then the market did something absolutely crazy it bought more us debt after our debt rating was cut prices went up and interest rates went down it was insane i remember seeing gross on msnbc or whatever right after it happened and he basically said i 'll be damned man       that 's when i officially 100 lost faith in active fund management and went to index funds only i 've always felt that there is very high efficiency in securities these days due to the free flow of information and enormous processing power to analyze it that being said the flight to index funds will probably tilt the balance of power in the other direction and increase inefficiency which will produce lower hanging fruit and then stock pickers start winning again maybe markets will reach a natural equilibrium or maybe we 'll just see the tide come in and out every few years or decades or so

to be honest i do n't know how any of this work in the us so my answer will be of very limited value to yourself i suspect but when it comes to the uk if you 're going to get the same pay gross either way than being independent makes very little sense   running your own business is hassle is generally more risky although possibly not in your case and costs money some of the most obvious costs are the added ni probably the need for an accountant at around Â£ 1200 p a for basic accountancy service you are obliged by law to have liability insurance and you probably want professional indemnity insurance this will be around Â£ 600 p a and so on and so forth   on top of that anyway as a contractor you really should n't be getting any benefits from the client and so health insurance company car even parking are all meant to be arranged by and paid by your company and ca n't or rather should n't be charged to the client so i would say if you 're seriously thinking about setting up a consultancy company and this client is first of many set up a company but take into account the sums you need to earn if you 're really thinking about employment be an employee

no that return on equity number is a target that the regulators consider when approving price hikes if pg&e tried to get a 20 roe the regulator would deny the request utilities are basically compelled to accept price regulation in return for a   monopoly on utility business in a geographic area there are obviously no guarantees that a utility will make money but these good utilities are good stable investments that generally speaking will not make you rich but appreciate nicely over time due to deregulation however they are a more complex investment than they once were basically the utility builds and maintains a bunch of physical infrastructure buys fuel and turns it into electricity so they have fixed costs regulated pricing market driven costs for fuel and market driven demand for electricity   also consider that the marginal cost of adding capacity to the electric grid is incredibly high so uneven demand growth or economic disruption in the utility service area can hurt the firms return on equity and thus the stock price compare the stock performance of he the hawaiian electric to ed consolidated edison the nyc utility to so southern companies the utility for much of the south you can see that the severe impact of the recession on he really damaged the stock location matters buying strategy is key as well during bad market conditions money flows into these stocks which are considered to be low risk defensive investments and inflates the price you do n't want to buy utilities at a peak you need to dollar cost average a position over a period of years and hold it focus on the high quality utilities or quality local utilities if you understand your local market look at southern co progress energy duke energy or american electric power as high quality benchmarks to compare with other utilities

i work on a buy side firm so i know how these small data issues can drive us crazy hope my answer below can help you   reason for price difference 1 vendor and data source basically data providers such as google and yahoo redistribute eod data by aggregating data from their vendors although the raw data is taken from the same exchanges different vendors tend to collect them through different trading platforms for example yahoo is getting stock data from which was acquired by morningstar which is not the most accurate source of eod stocks google gets data from deutsche   to make the process more complicated each vendor can choose to get eod data from another eod data provider or the exchange itself or they can produce their own open high low close and volume from the actual trade tick data and these data may come from any exchanges   2 price adjustment   for equities data the re distributor usually adjusts the raw data by applying certain customized procedures this includes adjustment for corporate actions such as dividends and splits for futures data rolling is required and back ward and for rolling can be chosen different adjustment methods can lead to different price display   3 extended trading hours   along with the growth of electronic trading many market tends to trade during extended hours such as pre open and post close trading periods futures and fx markets even trade around the clock this leads to another freedom in price reporting whether to include the price movement during the extended trading hours    conclusion to cross verify the true price we should always check the price from the exchange where the asset is actually traded given the convenience of getting eod data nowadays this task should be easy to achieve   in fact for professional traders and investors alike they will never reply price on free providers such as yahoo and google they will most likely choose bloomberg reuters etc however for personal use yahoo and google should both be good choices and the difference is small enough to ignore

the pros and cons of investing in a closed end fund both stem from the fact that the price per share is likely to differ from the net asset value nav of the underlying assets that could work to your advantage if the fund is selling for less than nav or at a discount then you get the benefit of the bargain and hope to sell the shares in the future for par or even a premium more than nav on the other hand if you buy such a fund at a premium you stand to have a relative loss if the value of the fund goes back to par or a discount compared to nav that 's because a closed end fund has a fixed number of shares with the assets continually being reinvested in essence you are buying out an existing shareholder of the fund at a price determined by supply and demand this differs from an open end fund in which your contribution creates new shares all other things being equal then the fund has to invest your money and charges you a fee for the service on exactly a pro rata basis with other investors in the fund meaning that you will enter and exit such a fund at par in either case your return depends mainly on the performance of the underlying assets but there are premium discount issues for investing in a closed end fund

you must consider the different levels of risk associated with each loan when the bank loans you money it does so based on a high degree of information about your financial situation through your credit report + additional information gathered at the time of granting your request it feels quite confident that you will repay them and therefore considers you to be low risk in order to make a profit off of all its low risk clients the bank only needs to charge a small rate of interest competitive with the market but enough to cover the losses from clients who will default when you loan money through a peer to peer program you are at two distinct disadvantages from the bank 1 your loan portfolio will not be diversified that is you may have only a single person or a small handful of people owing you money any catastrophic event in their lives may wipe out their loan to you whereas the bank can play the averages with a broader client base 2 you have less information and ultimately less effective power to reclaim your losses would you feel confident walking behind the desk at a bank today and deciding whether to approve someone 's loan based on the information that the bank 's back end has already determined is necessary to make that decision now how about when you are doing it on your own because of this you take on more risk from a peer to peer loan than a bank takes on from you that 's why the person is willing or required due to market availability to pay a higher rate they know they are higher risk that does n't mean this is a bad idea just that there is a specific reason that the difference in rates exists and it implies that you should consider carefully whether the risks outweigh the benefits note that the concept of taking a buy sell position on two theoretically identical assets while earning a net profit at no risk is known as arbitrage arbitrage situations rarely exist and never for long whenever you see a position that appears to be arbitrage consider what might make it not so ie you could buy inventory in location a and sell it at 10 higher margin in location b but have you considered transportation carrying costs and interest for the period that you physically held the inventory the appearance of arbitrage may in my opinion be a sign that you have incomplete information

i think that people only use the phrase only spend what you can afford to lose when they are talking about the most risky or speculative investments or even gambling    when talking about gambling the following quote is a bottom line the speculative investment that brought me to this question via google is how much should i invest in bitcoin   i was tempted to put in 10 of my investments not including the 6 month safety fund and not including equity in my home   now thinking about this question it seems that it depends on your income as a percentage of your investment income which should grow in proportion to the whole over time   for example early stage of career not much investment income 20 mid career 5 mid late career moving to more safe investments 5 late career retirement 1 another way to calculate would be as a percentage of the amount you put into retirement savings per year   maybe 10 of this figure when you 're young and 1 nearer to retirement

given your time frame i 'm not sure if investing in a 529 is your best option if you 're investing in a 529 you may have to deal with market volatility and the amount you invest over the course of three years could be worth less than what you had initially invested when it comes to your child 's college education the main idea of starting a plan like a 529 is the time frame for your investments to grow you also have the option of pre paying your child 's college but that has restrictions most of the state sponsored pre pay plans limit you to state schools if that was n't obvious also the current political situation is tricky and may influence the cost of education in ~3 4 years but i 'm not sure this is the proper place for that discussion also as far as the viability of these it depends state by state i live in illinois and do n't think i would count on a payout given our current financial situation you could however look into paying tuition now for a state school and it will be risk free in terms of inflation but again it 's hard to anticipate the political scope of this they also have private pre pay plans but that would limit your child 's university options just as the state pre pay check out this investopedia article on 529 plans it 's basic but will give you a high level overview bankrate has an overview as well

excellent analysis i agree that one of the main reasons millenials are so critical of advertising is we have grown up with it our entire lives the author calls the millenials digital natives which is an absolute misnomer and a term i have been using for years to refer to the generation to come the true digital natives who have been downloading apps since before they were creating memories we ought to be called advertising natives i am fully aware people are trying to sucker me out of my money for mostly frivolous causes so i have add blinders on and generally research products before i buy them gone are the days of claiming something is new and improved having any affect on consumers

1 how long have you had the car   generally accounts that last more than a year are kept on your credit report for 7 years while accounts that last less than a year are only kept about 2 years iirc could someone correct me if that last number is wrong 2 who is the financing through   if it 's through a used car dealer there 's a good chance they 're not even reporting it to the credit bureaus i had this happen to me the dealer promised he 'd report the loan so it would help my credit i made my payments on time every time and nothing ever showed up   it pissed me off because another positive account on my credit report would have really helped my score   banks and brand name dealers are more likely to report the loan 3 what are your expected long term gains on the stocks you 're considering selling and will you have to pay capital gains on them when you do sell them   the cost of selling those stocks could possibly be higher than the gain from paying off the car so you 'll want to run the numbers for a couple different scenarios optimistic growth pessimistic etc and see if you come out ahead or not 4 are there prepayment penalties or costs associated with paying off the car loan early   most reputable financiers wo n't include such terms or they 'll only be in effect during the first few months of the loan but again it depends on who the loan is through in short it depends   i know people hate hearing answers like that but it 's true   hopefully though you 'll be able to sit down and look at the specifics of your situation and make an informed decision

what you have here is an interesting argument right now this is totally complicated by the state of forced insurance that is currently in such hot debate right now   as a general rule of thumb though most americans pay their medical bills in one way or another though it is also accurate to say that most americans have avoided paying a medical bill at one point or another   i will give an example that will help clarify my wife gets a iron infusion shot one every year or so we choose not to have insurance the cost to us is around $ 275 we know this upfront and have always paid it up front except for one year one year we had insurance the facility that does the charged us $ 23,500 to do the infusion that year the insurance paid $ 275 to them we refused to pay the remaining   $   this is a real example using real numbers   so while we are more then able to pay the normal amount and we could in theory pay the inflated amount we out right refuse to   the medical facility tried to negotiated the amount down to $ 11,000 but we refused they then tried to talk us into a credit plan we refused then they negotiated the entire thing down to $ 500 we refused finally after 2 years of fighting they agreed that the service had been pair for by the insurance and sent us a $ 0 bill   the entire time that facility was more then willing to keep doing this annual service for $ no time were we denied care we did have a dent in our credit for a while but honestly it did n't matter to us wrap up it is fair to say that most americans do pay their medical bills but it is also fair to say that most americans do not pay all their medical bills the situation is complicated and made more so by recent changes   heath insurance is the u.s. is nearly criminal and while some changes have been made in recent years the same overriding truth exists sometimes a medical bill when going through insurance is just plain silly and the only recourse you have as a customer is to not pay it for a while till you get it sorted out

this can be done you can be prosecuted for some forms of it in any case there are more riskless ways of doing what you suggested first buying call options from market makers results in market makers buying shares at the same delta as the call option 100 shares x delta = how many shares mm 's bought you can time this with the volume and depth of the shares market to get a bigger resulting move caused by your options purchase to get bigger quote changes in your option so on expiration day you can be trade near at the money options back and forth between being out the money and in the money you would exit the position into liquidity at a profit the risk here is that you can be sitting on a big options position where the commissions costs get really big but you can spread this out amongst several options contracts second you can again take advantage of market maker inefficiencies by getting your primary position whether in the share market or options market placed and then your other position being a very large buy order a few levels below the best bid many market makers and algorithms will jump in front of your they think they are being smart but it will raise the best bid and likely make a few higher prints for the mark raising the price of your call option and eventually remove your large buy order again you exit into liquidity this is called spoofing there have been some regulatory actions against people in doing this in the last few years as for consequences you need to put things into perspective us capital market regulators have the most nuanced regulations and enforcement actions of worldwide capital market regulators and even then they get criticized for being unable or unwilling to curb these practices with that perspective american laws are basically a blueprint on what to do in 100 other country 's stock exchanges where the legislature has never gotten around to defining the same laws the securities regulator is even more underfunded and and the markets more inefficient not advice just reality

gt we 're talking about low paying jobs and if there 's more applicants than jobs than why are staffing companies huge right now   yeah i 'm talking about low paying also staffing companies are huge because you can try before you buy understand your argument just fell apart just because there is correlation it does n't mean they are related we have tons of illegals and even more unemployed people    gt because ca n't fill the jobs like they want there 's absolutely a ton of demand for low paying workers all around   lets see some proof because there is no shortage in most of the country unless you 're talking about the ones on farms possibly we have an extremely high unemployment rate   gt   places ca n't keep or find people even to stay for a month    maybe that s because they are drug addicted losers or shitty workers ever thought of that that does n't mean there is a shortage of employees there is a shortage of good ones   gt anyone that 's ever applied knows these places also end up having tons of overtime because they do n't have enough help   wrong zero evidence and its clearly wrong no one wants to give these people benefits so they often do n't even hire them as full time in any medium large size company    gt your idea is to take all three of illegals felons and potheads out of jobs yet somehow still these jobs that staffing companies have been trying to fill   in la we have no shortage and it applies to tons of places throw the illegals out they do n't belong here   felons someone can hire them i wo n't   potheads someone will hire them too but i wo n't hire someone that comes to work high lacks motivation and is not happy i want employees that want to work and want to grow with those type of employees not only do businesses grow and become more successful but those employees can get promoted and do better in life i want my employees to do well in life because to me the good ones are family

do you mean how much income tax the irs will assess loans are not income therefore they do not incur income tax so as long as the money is n't being given but being loaned you do n't have to pay income tax on it and just in case you think there 's a loophole of instead of paying my workers i 'll just loan them their paychecks and then forgive the debt at the end of the year no the irs does consider loan forgiveness to be a form of income so you need to look at whether the loan is going to you or whether your business is a separate legal entity that is getting the money if it 's a capital contribution then you are selling a stake in your company or more precisely as long as the money is going into the business the company is selling a stake in itself in that case there generally is n't tax owed here 's a question that touches on this

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

a bit of poking around brought me to this thread on the motley fool asking the same basic question i think the problem is the stock price for a stock to be sold short it has to be marginable which means it has to trade over $ 5.00 the broker therefore ca n't borrow the stock for you to sell short because it is n't held in their clients margin accounts my guess is that etrade along with other brokers simply exclude these stocks for short selling has an explanation of non marginable securities specific to stocks under $ 5 other securities such as stocks with share prices under $ 5 or with extremely high betas may be excluded at the discretion of the broker itself

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies
# 549290
i would not advise this for two reasons your point that the investment could be lower at the end of the 3 years is a concern although with a safe investment it is less so but this reduces the potential gain while your interest is not gaining interest your interest charged is based on the principal if you pay off the loans you reduce the principal and therefore you pay less interest in the long run even if the interest is n't capitalized all that this means is that you are basically being charged simple interest as opposed to compounding interest but reducing the principal helps in either case you are mistaken about the benefits of the tax deduction you reduce your tax bill by the marginal rate times the student loan interest you paid for the year so if you are in the 15 tax bracket and paid $ 100 in interest you save $ 15 this is not a reason to keep the loans because you have to pay $ 100 to get $ 15 but you are mistaken on the benefit it has nothing to do with shifting the tax brackets also speaking of taxes do n't forget that you pay taxes on investment gains

financial statements provide a large amount of specialized complex information about the company if you know how to process the statements and can place the info they provide in context with other significant information you have about the market then you will likely be able to make better decisions about the company if you do n't know how to process them you 're much more likely to obtain incomplete or misleading information and end up making worse decisions than you would have before you started reading you might for example figure out that the company is gaining significant debt but might be missing significant information about new regulations which caused a one time larger than normal tax payment for all companies in the industry you 're investing in matching the debt increase or you might see a large litigation related spending without knowing that it 's lower than usual for the industry it 's a chicken and egg problem if you know how to process them and how to use the information then you already have the answer to your question i 'd say the more important question to ask is do i have the time and resources necessary to learn enough about how businesses run and about the market i 'm investing in so that financial statements become useful to me if you do have the time and resources do it it 's worth the trouble i 'd advise in starting at the industry business end of things though and only switching to obtaining information from the financial statements once you already have a good idea what you 'll be using it for

here is my perception of the situation obtained from reading degiro 's client agreement if degiro shuts down it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker if degiro shuts down unexpectedly your assets will remain to be held at spv a separate legal entity which degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients since spv does nothing else but holding the assets it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own with some help from degiro and/or the regulator you should be able to transfer your assets from spv to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them if you have a non custody account you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets because degiro can borrow your securities held at spv if both the client for whom degiro borrowed a security and degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time the lent security will not be returned to spv there will arise a shortage which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security however then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 eur of your losses

if there is any fee at all on the cash advance and zero interest on the student loans for now it 's not worth it mathematically   and for only 8 months of free money it 's rare for it to be worth it overall you need to save a significant amount either by having a good net interest rate e.g. saving 20 on another card and not paying any interest on the new loan or by saving a lot on principal e.g. paying off $ 100k now and not paying the interest on that for the next 8 months i would n't worry about it hurting your credit score unless your credit is going to be evaluated during the time you 're maxing your card part of your score 20 30 iirc is your credit utilization ratio which is how much you have available vs. how much you 're using it 's separate from the part that accounts for history so it 's only relevant at the time you 're looked up

there 's no easy solution to this unfortunately i think you need a different approach as you say using software to track expenses to the percentages and such has n't helped and in my own experience this sort of money management does not work with all people maybe you need to look at the expenses and decide what you can cut out somehow we all need to make a distinction between what we need milk bread and what we do n't need magazines dvds but still purchase every now and then sadly buying things for the second category quickly builds up a bill just as big as the one for the weekly shop only that it contains nothing of actual value and it just seems too easy for some to spend and equal amount of money on wants as on needs and if a substantial amount of your outgoings are in this category that 's where you need to focus the discussion if you ca n't find any purchases like that i suspect you need to buy less expensive food

ultimately no one really knows what causes the markets to rise and fall beyond supply and demand if more people want to buy then sell prices go up and if more people want to sell prices go down the news channels will often try to attribute a specific reason to the price move but that is largely just guess work to fill up the news pages so people have something to read you may find it interesting to read up on the elliot wave principle the crash of 2008 was a perfect elliot wave fit elliot wave theory states that social which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern the crash in september was a wave 3 down this is where the majority of people give up hope however there are still a few people who are still holding on the markets tend to about during wave 4 finally the last few people give up hope and sell out this causes the final crash of wave 5 only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again

from what you 've described your spouse is a non resident alien for us tax purposes you have two choices use the nonresident spouse treated as resident election and file as married filing jointly since your spouse does n't have and does n't currently qualify for an ssn he she will need to apply for an itin together with the tax filing note that by becoming a resident alien your spouse 's worldwide income the whole year would be subject to us taxes and would need to be reported on your joint tax filing though he she will be able to use the foreign earned income exclusion to exclude $ 100k of her foreign earned income since he she will have been out of the us for 330 days in a 12-month period or file as married filing separately you write nra for your spouse 's ssn on your tax return as a nonresident alien if your spouse does n't have any us income he she does n't have to file a us tax return and does n't need to apply for an itin which one is better is up to you to figure out

probably the easiest way for individual investors is oil etfs   in particular uso seems to be fairly liquid and available   you should check carefully the bid ask spreads in this volatile time   there are other oil etfs and leveraged and inverse oil etfs exist as well but one should heed the warnings about leveraged etfs oil futures are another possibility though they can be more complicated and tough to access for an individual investor   note that futures have a drift associated with them as well   be careful close or roll any positions before delivery of course unless you have a need for a bunch of actual barrels of oil finally you can consider investing in commodities etfs or energy stocks or stock etfs that are strongly related to the price of oil   as keshlam mentions care is advised in all these methods   many people thought oil reached its bottom a few weeks back then opec decided to do nothing and the price dropped even further

the commenters who referred you to the prisoner 's dilemma are exactly correct but i wanted to give a more detailed explanation because i find game theory quite interesting   the prisoner 's dilemma is a classic scenario in game theory where even though it 's in the best interests of two or more players to cooperate they fail to do so wikipedia has a simple example using prisoners but i 'll use a simple example using and charles who are fund managers at fidelity and charles schwab respectively   to make the table shorter i abbreviated a bit inc = increase fees keep = keep fees the same dec = decrease fees here is the dilemma itself in the table that shows the resulting market shares if each fund manager follows the course of action in question   while this example is n't mathematically rigorous because i completely fabricated the numbers it makes a good example the most profitable course of action would be both fund managers agreeing to increase their fees which would keep their market shares the same but increase their profits as they earn more fees however this wo n't happen for several reasons   because economies of scale exist in the market for investment funds it 's reasonable to assume in a simple example that as funds grow larger their costs decrease so even though a fund manager decreases his fees the other players this decrease wo n't be enough to reduce their profits in fact the increased market share resulting from such a decrease may well dominate the decreased fees and lead to higher profits the prisoner 's dilemma is highly applicable to markets such as these because they exist as oligopolies i.e. markets where a relatively small number of established sellers possess considerable market power if you actually wanted to model the market for donor advised funds using game theory you need to take a few more things into account obviously there are more than two firms it 's probably a valid assumption that the market is an oligopoly with significant economies of scale but i have n't researched this extensively   there is more than one time period so some form of the prisoner 's dilemma is needed the market for donor advised funds is also complicated by the fact that these are philanthropic funds this may introduce tax implications or the problem of goodwill and institutional opinion of these funds although both funds increasing their fees may increase their profits in theory institutional investors may look on this as a pure profit seeking and take their funds elsewhere for example they may choose to invest in smaller funds with higher fees but better reputations while reputation is important for any company it might make more of a difference when the fund investment vehicle is philanthropic in nature   i am by no means an expert on game theory so i 'm sure there are other nuances to the situation that i 'm unaware of

that would deprive me of the rental income from the property yes but you 'd gain by not paying the interest on your other mortgage   so your net loss or gain is the rental income minus the interest you 're paying on your home   from a cash flow perspective you 'd gain the difference between the rental income and your total payment any excess proceeds from selling the flat and paying off the mortgage could be saved and use later to buy another rental for retirement income   or just invest in a retirement account and leave it alone   selling the flat also gets rid of any extra time spent managing the property if you keep the flat you 'll need a mortgage of 105 k to 150 k plus closing costs depending on the cost of the house you buy so your mortgage payment will increase by my fist choice would be to sell the flat and buy your new house debt free or with a very small mortgage   you 're only making 6 on it and your mortgage payment is going to be higher since you 'll need to borrow about 160k if you want to keep the flat and buy a $ 450 k house so you 're no longer cash flow neutral then start saving like mad for a different rental property or in non real estate retirement investments

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

if you want to make a profit from long term trading whatever long term means for you the best strategy is to let the good performers in your portfolio run and the bad ones   of course that strategy is hard to follow unless you have the perfect foresight to know exactly how long your best performing investments will continue to outperform the market but markets do n't always follow the assumption that perfect information is available to all participants and hence momentum has a real world effect on prices whether or not some theorists have chosen to ignore it but a fixed strategy of daily rebalancing does exactly the opposite of the above it continuously reduces the holdings of good performers and increases the holdings of bad   if this type of rebalancing is done more frequently than the constituents of benchmark index are adjusted it is very likely to underperform the index in the long term other issues in a real world market are the impact of increased dealing costs on smaller parcels of securities and the buy sell spreads incurred in the daily rebalancing trades if the market is up and down 1 on alternate days with no long trend quite likely the fund will be repeatedly buying and selling small parcels of the same stocks to do its daily balancing

verbal agreements are not legally binding unless you have signed a new lease agreement you are not obligated to continue renting the property you are free to go   on the other hand if you really like the place and want to stay you should sign another lease agreement this agreement will be binding on whomever owns the home whether it is your current landlord a bank or a new purchaser   but if you go this route make sure that there is not a clause that says the lease agreement is void upon foreclosure or something similar this is a standard clause in lease agreements allowing the bank to cancel the lease another option if you really like the house is to offer to buy the property if the property is being foreclosed on you could suggest buying on a short sale here is a link to an article i wrote entitled buy instead of rent a recovering real estate market that discusses the benefits of buying rather than renting

i believe it goes a little something like this during period of inflation all boats rise everyone get 's richer and gain control of more physical assets during periods of depression debts are being called due by those who gave out the loans these few powerful men that ca n't be paid and so foreclosures and the like occur giving the creditors control of the actual physical assets   basically you have to track physical assets instead of financial ones to see how the boom and busts are beneficial to the wealthy

when i invest in a business valued at $ 50,000 i pay $ 25,000 and receive 50 equity does that $ 25,000 go to the current owner of the business or into the capital of the business itself   who receives the money depends on who is selling you the equity   there are a couple of different scenarios that can fit your question you could buy existing shares from the current owner(s of the company   in this case the current owner(s would be receiving the funds from you and in return giving you their stake in the company   so if you all agree that the value of the business is $ 50,000 and you give $ 25,000 to the current owner(s they give you half of their shares   the value of the company has not changed the company could be issuing new shares   this is called stock dilution or an increase in authorized share capital   let 's say that everyone agrees that the value of the business is $ 50,000   the company could create new shares and sell them to you for $ 25,000   in this case the value of the company has jumped to $ 75,000 you now control one third of the company and the existing owner(s who previously owned 100 of the company now only own two thirds   in order for you to end up with 50 of the company in this case you would have to invest $ 50,000 instead which would result in the company being valued at $ 100,000    if you are wondering why the current owners would agree to this second scenario there are two questions that address this

why does n't it seem right to you the lender financed the house and has the first right claim mortgage on it so if you have any insurance proceeds they 're first offsetting your debt to the lender same as if you were selling the house first the loan is paid off whatever is left goes to you if the property is not lost then the proceeds are going to you and you keep paying the mortgage so if a pipe burst and you need to replace the flooring the insurance will cover it and you 'll get the proceeds if the building is lost and you 're paid the fair market rebuild value then you first need to pay off the mortgage its standard

your goal of wanting to eliminate your debts early is great generally you can save more money by paying off loans with higher interest rates first however it sounds like you are excited about the idea of eliminating one of your car loans in two months   there is nothing wrong with that it is good to be excited about eliminating debt   i like your plan pay off the $ loan first then apply the $ monthly payment to the $ loan   you 'll have that loan paid off almost 3 years early   perhaps you 'll find some additional money to apply to it and get rid of it even earlier after you 've eliminated both car loans save up that $ 1000/month for your next car   that will allow you to pay cash for it which will allow you to negotiate the best price and save interest   0 loans are not free money other answers will tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your 0 loan but i think there can be good reasons to eliminate smaller loans first regardless of interest

you have heard the old adage buy low sell high right that sounds so obvious that you 'd have to wonder why they would ever bother such an expression it should rank up there with do n't walk in front of a moving car on the duh scale of advice well your question demonstrates exactly why it is n't quite so obvious in the real world and that people need to be reminded of it   so in your example the stock prices are currently low relative to what they have been so per that adage do you sell or buy when prices are low hint it is n't sell yes your gut is going to tell you the exact opposite thanks to the fact that our brains are unfortunately wired to make us susceptible to the loss aversion fallacy when the market has undergone a big drop is the worst time to stop contributing buying stocks   this example might help get your brain and gut to agree a little more easily if you were talking about any other non investment commodity cars for instance   your question equates to i really need a car but the prices have been dropping like crazy lately     maybe i should wait until the car dealers start raising their prices again before i buy one dollar cost averaging as littleadv suggested if you have an automatic payroll deduction for your retirement account you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging because you are investing the same amount on a scheduled interval you are buying more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are expensive it is like an automatic buy low strategy is built into the account the alternative which you are implying is a market timing strategy under this strategy instead of investing regularly you try to get in and out of investments right before they go up drop there are two major flaws with this approach    1 your brain will work against you see above and encourage you to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing    2 unless you are this strategy is n't much better than gambling if you are lucky it can work but because of 1 the odds are stacked against you

the only way you will incur underpayment penalties is if you withhold less than 90 of the current year 's tax liability or 100 of last years tax liability whichever is smaller   so as long as your total tax liability last year not what you paid at filing but what you paid for the whole year was more than $ you should not have any penalty what you pay or get back when you file will be your total tax liability less what was withheld for example you had $ withheld from your pay for taxes   if after deduction and other factors your tax liability is $ you will owe $ 111 when you file   on the other hand if your tax liability is only $ 1,000 you 'll get a refund of $ when you file since you 've had more withheld that what you owe since your income was only for part of the year and tax tables assume that you make that much for the whole year i would suspect that you over withheld during your internship which would offset the lack of withholding on the other $ 6,000 in income

gt;if banks did not have a big brother to bail them out of loans that went bust whenever they wanted they would be a lot more careful in who they loaned money to     that 's what they became an avenue to offload risk   the reason those banks were making bad loans was the high demand for trading in mortgage backed securities not because freddie and fannie were there they wanted to make those loans anyway so there 'd be more paper to trade if you could transfer half of the risk of a loan you already knew was shitty to another entity but still keep all the profits and fuck around with the derivatives then of course you 'll take full advantage    the intention behind them was to help that margin of people that fell just below the banks historically very high standards for home lending banks seek high profits fannie and freddie were to operate at break even or slim profit but serve a population toward upward economic benefits everyone when the banks lending standards dropped precipitously due to repeal of glass steagall creation of new exotic financial instruments and appalling lack of regulatory enforcement everything kind of went to shit   in my view they 're much more a casualty that 's become a scapegoat than a causal force

there are two main ways you can make money through shares through dividends and through capital gains if the company is performing well and increasing profits year after year its net worth will increase and if the company continues to beat expectations then over the long term the share price will follow and increase as well on the other hand if the company performs poorly has a lot of debt and is losing money it may well stop paying dividends there will be more demand for stocks that perform well than those that perform badly thus driving the share price of these stocks up even if they do n't pay out dividends there are many market participants that will use different information to make their decisions to buy or sell a particular stock some will be long term buy and hold others will be day traders and there is everything in between some will use fundamentals to make their decisions others will use charts and technicals some will use a combination and others will use completely different information and methods these different market participants will create demand at various times thus driving the share price of good companies up over time the annual returns from dividends are often between 1 and 6 and in some cases up to 10 however annual returns from capital gains can be 20 50 100 or more that is the main reason why people still buy stocks that pay no dividends it is my reason for buying them too

while i can appreciate you 're coming from a strongly held philosophy i disagree strongly with it   i do not have any 401k or ira i do n't like that you need to rely on government and keep the money there forever a 401k and an ira allows you to work within the irs rules to allow your gains to grow tax free additionally traditional 401ks and iras allow you to deduct income from your taxes meaning you pay less taxes missing out on these benefits because the rules that established them were created by the irs is very very misguided do you refuse to drive a car because you philosophically disagree with speed limits   i am planning on spending 20k on a new car paying cash paying cash for a new car when you can very likely finance it for under 2 means you are loosing the opportunity to invest that money which can conservatively expect 4 returns annually if invested additionally using dealership financing can often be additional leverage to negotiate a lower purchase price   if for some reason you have bad credit or are unable to secure a loan for under 4 paying cash might be reasonable   the best thing you have going for you is your low monthly expenses that is   if early retirement is your goal you should consider housing expenses as a part of your overall plan but i would strongly suggest you start investing that money in stocks instead of a single house especially when you can rent for such a low rate a 3 fund portfolio is a classic and simple way to get a diverse portfolio that should see returns in good years and stability in bad years you can read more about them here you should never invest in individual stocks people make lots of money to professionally guess what stocks will do better than others and they are still very often wrong you should purchase what are sometimes called stocks but are really very large funds that contain an assortment of stocks blended together you should also purchase bonds which again are not individual bonds but a blend of the entire bond market   if you want to be very aggressive in your portfolio go with 100 80 stocks the remainder in bonds if you are nearing retirement you should be the inverse 100 80 bonds the remainder stocks   the rule of thumb is that you need 25 times your yearly expenses including taxes but minus pension or social security income invested before you can retire since you 'll be retiring before age 65 you wo nt be getting social security and will need to provide your own health insurance

when discussing buying a home i often hear people say they like having    a mortgage because they get the benefit of writing off the interest i assume this is the united states   you need to also consider that many people can take the standard deduction of about $ 12k for married couples filing jointly so even if they itemize the interest it would only make sense to write it off if you are able to itemize deductions greater than the standard deduction   source so some people will input the mortgage interest and other related deductions into the computer only to find out that their itemized deductions do n't add up where it benefits people sometimes is if they have medical bills which are greater than 10 of their income in addition to the mortgage interest so it benefits them to itemize there are other major sources of but medical bills are very common other common items are auto registration taxes or interest from student loans it is going to be situation dependent but if you are within a few years of paying off the mortgage it would make sense to make micropayments to accelerate the payoff date if you have 30 years to go it would make more sense to generate an emergency fund pay off a car or save up for other things in life than worry about paying off a mortgage take the benefit of deducting the mortgage interest if you can but i imagine that many people would be surprised to hear that it 's not always black and white

it 's definitely not a good idea to pay off one of the smaller loans in your case a $ 4k payment split across all the loans would be better than repaying the 5 $ 4k loan completely as it 's the most beneficial of your loans and thus is last priority for repayment a payment that splits across all the loans equally is in effect a partial repayment on a loan with an interest rate of weighed average rate of all your loans   it 's not as good as repaying a 7 loan but almost as good it might be an option to save up until you can repay one of your 7 loans but it depends if it takes a lot of time then you would've paid interest during that time

there is no perfect age factors that i consider important are perfect age for the long term care insurance is after you retire when you are working you do have insurance provided by your employer   it also depends on your assets if you have assets in excess of $ 250,000 then you will less likely get any government assistance   in general age between 60 and 65 would be perfect for the long term care insurance

i was hesitant to answer this question since i do n't own mlp even though i 'm aware of how they work   but hear on this question so here goes   i 'll try to keep this as non technical as possible mlps are partnerships where a shareholder is a partner and liable for the partnership 's taxes   mlps do n't pay corporate tax since the tax burden flows to you the shareholder so does that mean like a partnership the partners are liable for the company 's actions   technically yes has it happened before no of course there are limitations to the liability but are not definitely shielded in a way normal shareholders are    mlps issue a k-1 at the beginning of the year feb mar   the tax calculations are relatively complex and i 'm not going to go over that in this post generally mlps are a bad choice for tax deferred accounts like iras since there are tax implications beyond certain limits of distribution yes even out of an ira you 'll have to pay taxes if above the limit not all types of businesses can become mlps hey no corporate tax let 's form an mlp only companies engaged in businesses related to real estate commodities or natural resources can become mlps   there are a number of mlps out there   the largest is   morgan energy partners hope this helps

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

there are several assumptions you made that do n't match the current laws costs cobra
# 538750
many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

not true the language used in the navy amp army clauses are different there is a duty to maintain the navy and support the armies there is no such mandate in the postal clause nor can the act of establishing be read as implying maintenance because the constitution specifically includes those things for the army and navy suggesting it was not implied    you can establish something and then privatize it government chartered companies were common at the time so it 's not like the idea did n't occur to them    strictly speaking i do n't see any reason that congress could n't also privatize the army and navy assuming that maintain and support do n't imply direct congressional control but that 's a harder argument compared to this much easier distinction in the case of the post office

there is more than one exchange where stock can be traded    for example there is the new york stock exchange and the london stock exchange   in fact if you look at all the exchanges there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments eg us government bonds the closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the nyse   however options close after that and so there is after the close trading in many stocks with active options so the price at the close of options trading at cboe is often used the real price is always changing   but for the purpose of discussion using the closing price in nyse for nyse listed stocks is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned   likewise using bloomberg 's price makes sense using some after hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers until tomorrow

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

i strongly discourage leasing or loans but at least you own the car at the end of it in any situation it 's just a bad deal but that does n't answer your question   most new cars are loss leaders for dealerships   it 's too easy to know what their costs are these days so they make most of their money though financing   they might make a less than $ 500 on the sale of a new car but if it 's financed though them then they might get $ 2,000 $ 4,000 commission sale on the financing contract    yes it is possible and entirely likely that the advertised rate will only go to the best qualified possibly with a credit score about 750 or 800 or so other high number for example if the meets the requirements then they wo n't deny you they really want your business but it is more likely to start the process and do all the paperwork for them to come back and say well you do n't qualify for the $ leasing program but we can offer you the $ lease since that 's the price you 're giving from other dealerships from there you just need to negotiate again note make sure you always do your research and negotiate the price of the car before talking about financing

on paper the whole 6 months living costs sounds and is great but in real life there are a lot of things that you need to consider for example my first car was constantly falling apart and was an suv that got i have to travel for work about 300 miles per week so getting a sedan that averages close to saves me more in gas and maintenance than the monthly payment for the new car costs when our apartment lease was up the new monthly rent would have been $ per month we got a 30 year mortgage with a monthly payment of $ so buying a house actually let us put aside more each month we have just under 3 months of living expenses set aside 1 month in liquid assets 2 months in a brokerage account and i worry about it i wish we had a better buffer but in our case the house and car made more sense as an early investment compared to just away all our savings also do you have any debt paying off debt student loans credit card debt etc should often take top priority have some rainy day funds of course but pay down debts and then create a personal financial plan for what works best in your situation that would be my suggestion

this is a case where human nature and arithmetic lead to different results depending on the your income the effective interest rate on the mortgage is probably right around 2.5   so purely by arithmetic the absolute cheapest way to go is to put the $ 11k to the bigger car loan then pay off the mortgage then the smaller car loan the debt snowball is more effective however because it works better for people progress is demonstrated quickly which maintains and often enhances motivation to continue   i can say as a case in point having tried both methods that if does indeed work   so i am with you pay off the car loan first and roll that payment into the bigger car loan if you add no extra dollars you should get the small loan paid off in 6 to 8 months and the bigger car loan in another 16 to 18 months it sounds like from your message that you have another $ 1500 or so a month   if that is the case small loan paid off in two months bigger loan paid off in another year   if you stick with the ramsay program you then build an emergency fund and start investing good luck

the creation redemption mechanism is how shares of an etf are created or redeemed as needed and thus is where there can be differences in what the value of the holdings can be versus the trading price if the etf is thinly traded then the difference could be big as more volume would be where the mechanism could kick in as generally there are blocks required so the mechanism usually created or redeemed in lots of 50,000 shares i believe from the link where ap = authorized participant with etfs aps do most of the buying and selling when aps sense    demand for additional shares of an etf which manifests itself when the    etf share price trades at a premium to its nav they go into the market    and create new shares when the aps sense demand from investors    looking to redeem which manifests itself when the etf share price    trades at a discount they process redemptions so suppose the nav of the etf is $ 20/share and the trading price is $ 30/share the ap can buy the underlying securities for $ 20/share in a bulk order that equates to 50,000 shares of the etf and exchange the underlying shares for new shares in the etf then the ap can turn around and sell those new etf shares for $ 30/share and pocket the gain if you switch the prices around the ap would then take the etf shares and exchange them for the underlying securities in the same way and make a profit on the difference sec also notes this same process

this is a super contentious topic but we have to have a floor wage because we do n't have a free labor market   in order for the labor market to come up with a fair wage the market must be as close to de regulated as possible but we 've already seen what happens in an unregulated or low regulation market safety problems child labor abysmal wages   just ready a history book to see how the us down on sweat shops child labor and the rise of the unions    no one wants to work like that so we put regulations in place to fix those things this is why we have safety laws and rules to prevent our employers from stealing wages due to filing a report late or other stupid excuse    so we make the work places safer and put protections in to make sure people get paid but now we created a wage floor businesses are literally designed to make profit and you make profit by trimming all your expenses as much as necessary skilled employees have an easier time negotiating wages and they can band together in unions but low skilled and unskilled workers do n't have this ability   so they work for minimum wage    now regardless of a company 's ability to pay their workers $ 15/hr or not if you create a wage floor than do n't account for yearly cola inflation workers get left behind why does this matter there is a strong relationship between crime and poverty so we decide to create social programs to keep crime down but as the wage floor is not increased min wage workers require more government subsidy    either companies pay their employees enough where full time workers do n't qualify for government subsidy or the government tax payer ends up picking up the tab on behalf of these companies    you ca n't actually quantify the relationship between min wage and labor because it 's not just a labor issue it impacts crime health who has the ability to pay a $ 30 co pay if you 're chronically ill on min wage and government social welfare on local state and federal levels    we ca n't just demand that unskilled labors get skills so they get more money because that will end up devaluing skilled positions right now people argue that skilled positions are devalued when min wage increases and that 's true only if your employer fails to provide a like increase

i agree we should be efficient with the food we produce especially meats but i do n't like using food production efficiency overall as an encompassing statistic    it comes with all sorts of problems largely due to artificial fertilizer productions extremely demanding gmo plants and of course overall pesticides   pushing for extreme yields out of fields using artificial fertilizer can result in disastrous circumstances down the road over utilization of a field gives better returns now but we ca n't do that indefinitely and depletes the top soil of many and healthy bacteria over time yields will decrease and if it ever gets taken that far you end it with more problems even if you stop before it gets that bad you then have to suffer years of less than average yield to build the back up to health just so you can get average yield again and then there is the problem of how artificial fertilizer is made which while currently necessary to produce enough food currently 50 of the world 's food is produced directly due due to use of artificial fertilizer it utilizes fossil fuels both as and to burn for power to fuel the process of turning fossil fuels into fertilizer   if we really want to be sustainable we should be utilizing more farm land to make up for reduced yields from avoiding as much artificial fertilizer as we can

stock prices reflect future expectations of large groups of people and may not be directly linked to traditional valuations for a number of reasons not definitive for example a service like twitter is so popular that even though it has no significant revenue and loses money people are simply betting that it is deeply embedded enough that it will eventually find some way to make money you can also see a number of cases of ipos of various types of companies that do not even have a revenue model at all also if there is rapid sales growth in a but b sales are flat no one is likely to expect future profit growth in b such that the valuation will remain steady if sales in a are accelerating there may be anticipation that future profits will be high sometimes there are also other reasons such as if a owns valuable proprietary assets that will hold the values up however more information about these companies financials is really needed in order to understand why this would be the case

crisis and volatility benefit financiers and the wealthy even more now than they did then back then anybody left standing could buy at the bottom of a depression while it was those who needed wages to eat who really suffered nowadays arbitrage and derivatives not to mention federal policy make volatility itself a profitable proposition for people with lots of money to invest   that said i do n't think it 's a necessary conclusion from 's statement that he thought those at the top intentionally caused inflation and depression merely that their actions brought it about maybe he was complaining that the economy would be healthier and more stable if it were truly a free market or maybe he was arguing that greed at the top led to imprudent policy

when using a debit card there are two limits that may be imposed on the use the current balance and the maximum daily limit if the banking institution limits your daily usage that may mean that on a particular day you may not be able to make a large purchase even though you have money in the bank otherwise as long as you have funds in the account linked to the debit card you can make the transaction the catch is that as soon as the transaction is sent to the bank one of two things happens the money is immediately deducted from the account or a hold equal to the the amount of the transaction is placed on the account a hold is generally used when the transaction is done in two parts the pre scan at a restaurant or gas station the hold reduces the amount of available funds in the account a hold or an immediate deduction limits the size of future transactions to be able to make larger transactions you need to transfer more money into the account there is no debit card transaction that you can do to   artificially allow a larger transaction unless the bank is not placing a hold or doing an immediate deduction   because a debit card is linked to a bank account some accounts have overdraft protection this protection comes in two forms they either transfer your money from another account or they make a loan either way there can be costs involved

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

the way i approach afford to lose is that you need to sit down and figure out the amount of money you need at different stages of your life i can look at my current expenses and figure out what i will always roughly be paying bills groceries rent mortgage   i can figure out when i want to retire and how much i want to live on i generally group 401k and other retirement separately to what i want to invest with these numbers i can figure out how much i need to save to achieve this goal maybe you want to purchase a house in 5 years figure out the rough down payment and include that in your savings plan continue for all capital purchases that you can think you would aim for subtract your income from this and you have the amount of money you have greater discretion over subtracting current liabilities 4th of july holiday christmas presents and you have the amount you could afford to lose as to the asset allocation you should look at as others have mentioned that the younger you the greater your opportunity is to recoup losses personally i would disagree you should have some plan for the investment and use that goal to drive your diversification

it depends on the bank and network banks are to provide outgoing data at the certain time for the processing by the central clearing house the federal reserve system for ach which then distributes incoming data back to the banks all this has to be done between the closing of the business day and the opening of the next one if the transaction has n't completed the full path during that time it will wait at the position it was stuck at until the next cycle next night that 's why sometimes ach transactions take more than 1 day to complete if for example multiple fed banks have to be involved

you can not become a cfa charterholder without job experience i think it is 5 years in a finance related job but typically for students or recent graduates passing the level 1 exam has a lot of value as it signals your interest in the field and shows that you have the work ethic to go through the 1000 + pages of material the incremental value of level 2 and level 3 is not as much but they still add value i did a career change into finance and i planned to take the level 1 but i found that i did n't have the time to apply for jobs and study at the same time i ended up getting a job without taking the exam i did end up taking the exam last weekend after i started working at my new job

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

ownership of the debt is irrelevant if puerto rico tells the investors to kick rocks which it already has    puerto rico created the debt by accepting the loans it could n't pay and under terms that caused full repayment in the event of one default which spoiler alert happens when you accrue $ in debt with $ in unsecured pension liabilities created by bloated government pensions    they also gave the middle finger to the investors whose money they happily took when things were good only to flush it down the toilet and cry foul after they ran out of free money the teacher 's union and police officers unions opted out of ss so that they could reap these pension benefits    the reality is that puerto rico buried itself in social programs that never really got an economy that never had much going on to experience any growth it does n't matter who owns the debt this guy from the article sees a potential payday if the us in and saves them from their crisis

are there any monthly administrative fees on those loans that are charged separately if not you should just pay as much as you can as quick as you can to get the loan amount down on those loans with the highest interest rate if there are no separate fees on the loans then it 's just a lump of money with some interest rate the smaller loans will eventually drop away one by one have a celebration to remark the occasion when that happens i assume the payment is split evenly between the loans restructure if you get a better deal from someplace   delay buying new stuff until you get the loan amount down pay as much as you can as quickly as you can but keep enough money in your pocket to survive a month or two so that you do n't need to get any more loans in case something unexpected happens

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

i wrote about the dynamic of why either of a lower or higher exchange rate would be good for economies in would dropping the value of its currency be good for an economy a strong currency allows consumers to    import goods cheaply from the rest of    the world   a weak currency allows    producers to export goods cheaply to    the rest of the world   people are    both consumers and producers     clearly there have to be trade offs strong or weak mean relative to purchasing power parity i.e. you can buy more or less of an equivalent good with the same money governments worrying about unemployment will try and push their currencies weaker relative to others no matter the cost   there will be an inflationary impact imported inputs cost more as a currency weakens but a country running a major surplus like china can afford to subsidise these costs

i think you should really start a limited company for this it 'll be a lot simpler to spread the income over multiple years if your business and you have completely separate identities you should also consult an accountant if only once to understand the basics of how to approach this having a limited company would also mean that if it has financial problems you do n't end up having to pay the debts yourself with a separate company you would keep any money raised within the company initially and only pay it to yourself as salary over the three years so from an income tax point of view you 'd only be taxed on it as you received it the company would also pay for project expenses directly and there would n't be any income tax to pay on them at all you would have to pay other taxes like vat but you could choose to register for vat and then you 'd be able to reclaim vat on the company 's expenses but would have to charge vat to your customers if you start making enough money currently Â£ you have to register for vat whether you want to or not the only slight complication might be that you could be subject to corporation tax on the surplus money in the first year because it might seem like a profit however given that you would presumably have promised something to the over a three year period it should be possible to record your promises as a liability for unearned income in the company accounts in effect you 'd be saying although there 's still Â£ 60,000 in the bank i have promised to spend it on the thing so it 's not profit again you should consult an accountant at least over the basics of this

at one point in my life i sold cars and from what i saw three things stick out   unless the other dealership was in the same network eg abc ford of city a and abc ford of city b they never had possession of that truck so no real application for a loan could be sent in to a bank just a letter of intent if one was sent at all with a letter of intent a soft pull is done most likely by the dealership where they then attached that score to the that the bank has an automated program send back an automatic decline an officer review reply or a tentative approval eg tier 8 the tentative approval is just that tentative sometime after a lender has a loan officer look at the full application something prompts them to change their offer they have internal guidelines but lets say an app is right at the line for 2 3 of the things they look at they chose to lower the credit tier or decline the app the dealership then goes back and looks at what other offers they had let 's say they had a chase offer at 3.25 and a capone for 5.25 they would say you 're approved at 3.5 they make their money on the .25 but after chase looks into the app and sees that let 's say you have been on the job for actually 11 months and not 1 year and you said you made $ 50,000 but your 1040 shows $ and you have moved 6 times in the last 5 years they comeback and say no he is not a tier 2 but a tier 3 5.5 they switch to capone and say your rate has in fact gone up to 5.5 ultimately you never had a loan to start with only a letter of intent the other thing could be that the dealership finance manager looked at your credit score and guessed they would offer 3.5 when they sent in the it came back higher than he thought or he was you so if you price shopped while they looked for a truck you would n't get far they did n't find that truck or it was not what they thought it would be if a dealership sees a truck in inventory at another dealer they call and ask if it 's available if they have it and it 's not being used as a demo for a sales manager they agree to send them something else for the trade a car or truck or whatever a transfer driver of some sort hops in that trade drives the 30 minutes 6 hours away and comes back so you can sign the real application today while you 're excited about your new truck and willing to do whatever you need to do to get it because they said it would take 2 5 days to ship it tells me it was n't available time kills deals and dealerships know this they want to sign you today some dealerships want honest money or a deposit to go get the truck but reality is that that is a trick to test you to make sure you are going to follow through after they spend the gas and add mileage to a car but if it takes 2 the truck is n't out there or the dealer does n't have a vehicle the other dealership wants back or no other dealership likes dealing with them the only way it would take that long is if you were looking for something very rare an odd color in an unusual configuration   like a top end model in a low selling color or configuration you had to have that would n't sell well like you wanted all the options on a car except a cigarette lighter you get the idea 99.99 of the time a good enough truck is available deposits are bs they do n't setup any kind of real contract notice most of the time they want a check because holding on to a check is about as binding as making you wear a chicken suit to get a rebate all it is is a test to see if you will go through with signing the deal as an example of why you do n't let time pass on a car deal is shown in this one time we had a couple want us to find a cadillac hybrid in red with every available option total cost was about $ 85 90k only two new red hybrids were for sale in the country at the time one was in new york and the other was in san and our dealership is in texas and neither was wanting to trade with us so we ended up having to buy the suv from one of the other dealerships inventory that is a very rare thing to do by the way we took a 25 down payment around $ 20,000 in a check we flew a driver to wherever the suv was and then drove it back to texas about 4 days later the couple came back and hated the color they would not take the suv the general manager was pissed he spent around $ 1000 just to bring the thing to texas not to mention he had to buy the thing the couple walked and there was nothing the sales manager gm or salesman could do we had not been able to deliver the car and ultimately the dealership ate the loss but it shows that deposits are useless you ca n't sell something you do n't own and dealerships know it   long story short you ca n't claim a damage you never experienced not having something happen that you wanted to have happen is not a damage because you ca n't show a real economic loss one other thing when you sign the paperwork that you thought was an application it was an authorization for them to pull your credit and the fine print at the bottom is boiler plate defense against getting sued for everything imaginable ours took up about half of one page and all of the back of the second page i know dealing with car dealerships is hard working at them is just as hard and i 'm sorry that you had to deal with it however the simplest and car deals are the ones where you pay full price

  the main reason you see so many people in first class is because they earn miles for themselves just like anyone else can earn miles but they are not allowed to spend those miles on anything other than upgrades and other perks the one thing that is absolutely not allowed is to spend those miles on personal travel    most of those government employees that you see in those seats are frequent last minute travelers due to the nature of their jobs there will be certain routes handled primarily by certain airlines as they already bid for the business the airlines miles on those routes for employees will be greatly discounted but the airline miles associated with them are still calculated at the cost before the discount most private companies with specific contracts with airline routes work the same    unions are free to make their own rules on these things however i do know that many legitimate charities have policies similar to the government for how they can use airline miles   so in short it 's because they ca n't use their airline miles for anything except upgrades they ca n't even keep money received from being bumped from a flight     edit in another response it appears this article could be wrong about using your own miles for personal use thanks /u for steering me to look more at it      it appears temp duty travel miles can be used for personal trips another poster pointed out people flying enough to get lots of miles will also be elite status and thus get upgraded much more often even though their base fare is still coach

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

if you lease a car you are paying for the depreciation of a certain number of miles even if you do n't actually use those miles   since you know you will be well under the standard number of miles when your lease is up and you already know that you want to keep the car buying is better than leasing

though i have never had construction loan for a regular loan this clause only covers the period between when you submit the forms and when you close on the loan normally the construction loan is converted into a regular mortgage after the home is completed the lender wants to make sure that you do n't do anything that will make it impossible for the loans to close   they are concerned about new or loans they also care about spending the down payment money on something else when i was selling my condo the purchaser bought a new car the week before closing that made closing very interesting

i recently decided to out on a music system for the house which included a turntable i used to have a proper dj setup but that 's long been sold off and most of the records are of a genre i do n't listen to now but i wanted to enjoy the records i do listen to and also buy some more   one thing that struck me when listening through albums is how much more closely i listen to each track when it 's not part of an endless spotify playlist when you physically have to get up and flip the disc over every 3 tracks or so you pay so much more attention to it and it becomes a much more pleasurable experience rather than just background   it 's more labour intensive but that 's a good thing good music deserves your attention   edit also for all the replies to this that and make out it 's just a fad buying a vinyl offers so much more in terms of a physical product than cds or downloads i have a copy of 's my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and the actual design of the triple and all the included artwork is amazing    yes it 's more convenient to just get apple music or whatever but that 's not what we 're talking about it 's the reason people go a decent rather than mcdonalds

hi we are looking to connect with uk medical technology companies and other relevant people who could help us complete a project we are currently working on   we are currently representatives of a consortium of based in the middle east and iran     with the lifting of international sanctions by the 5 + 1 group of nations and in early 2016 on iran has resulted in our clients being very interested in purchasing and becoming official distributors off medical equipment from the uk   i have had some lengthy discussions with this team in dubai and and i 'm told the the domestic persian market has a very deep sense of of affiliation with german italian and french companies whom have been involved more in the persian gulf region than britain since 2012   one key point i did however notice is the demand and respect that british tech commands   this has encouraged our team to take on this project to help these guys access the products they require    they are interested in buying from uk manufacturing and reselling it as official distributors to the domestic persian markets population     they are also very interested in with and acquiring the licences to uk medical technologies which they would like to then buy the rights too or licence franchise for their locality and they have the capacity to invest in manufacturing this product in the middle east working in conjunction with the uk companies   an example of how this has worked in the past is the french car manufacturer working in collaboration with iranian engineering company to produce and manufacture car   which looks very much like a but is infact designed and developed   specifically for the local market and is also manufactured locally   this is a huge success and we feel we can imitate its success in our plan too   i have been in discussions with a number of sources where i could possibly complete this project through   i have come to know from my research globally within this sector that there are approx 3500 medical technology companies registered in the uk    all specialising in various fields   i was wondering is there a database anywhere which i ca n't access to see whom and where these companies are exactly in the uk     i have until now   established that between 70 80 of companies worldwide in med tech field are based in or affiliated with either the usa or israel   with the majority of the remaining 20 of companies being european or japanese   there are also many between euro companies which was quiet pleasing for me to see     we fully understand that the usa under trump have the sanction for usa   however our understanding is that we in the uk are not at present restricted by sanctions to trade with iranian companies    we strongly feel that the british medical technology sector here in the uk could benefit considerably it could also help it to progress   and grow to take a bigger global market share as well bring in 100s of millions in revenues for the uk economy   we strongly feel that with brexit negotiations in the pipeline as well as the geo political situation that the world finds itself in right now that this is the right time to work in collaboration with this consortium and help them with completion of this project successfully and   we strongly feel though that the due diligence carried in any trade deals needs to be within a framework of eu uk regulations and in compliance with any un or other sanctions we are un aware off   we had been planning to use due diligence guidelines from the usa when dealing with iranian companies however we feel this is the main reason why france and germany along with italy are winning all the contracts in iran and with the help of relevant government departments we would like to develop our own plan for this based on the current situation   we would like this to be the beginning of a number of high level trade deals we are in negotiations with right now with high level middle eastern business in dubai kuwait     we feel britain has missed it to france and germany when it comes to iran and would like to work with all the relevant departments to create a due diligence plan which is effective and helps us reach our goals   i would appreciate any advice you can give us in this respect   thanks   star senior project manager

i would suggest to get an authoritative response from a cpa in any case it would be for your own benefit to have at least the first couple of years of tax returns prepared by a professional however from my own personal experience in your situation the income should not be regarded as us income but rather income in your home country thus it should not appear on the us tax forms because you were not resident when you had it it was given to you by your employer which is not and you should have paid local taxes in your home country on it

the thing that gets so many people is that multilevel marketing is n't inherently a scam it has all of the potential that they try to sell you on it just so happens that every friend you have does n't have an infinite supply of friend networks completely unrelated to anyone you know so once you get three or four people in the same area in on an mlm or if you try to join not realizing that there are already people in on it and especially if you get in on mlm without knowing anything about he product aside from the mlm opportunities for your potential marks or without knowing anything about sales in general then people start getting screwed   mlm is cancer

first of all not all brokers allow trading during pre market and post market   some brokers only allow trading during the regular hours 4 pm et second of all while you can place orders using limit orders and market orders during regular trading hours you can only use limit orders during pre market and post market   this is because the liquidity is much lower during pre market and post market and using market orders could result in some trades filling at horrible prices   so brokers do n't allow using market orders outside of regular trading hours third some brokers require you to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre market or post market   for example my broker allows me to specify either day or ext for my orders   day means i want my order to execute only during regular trading hours and ext means i want my order to execute at any time pre market regular trading hours or post market finally if your broker allows pre post market trading and you place a limit order while specifying ext then your trade can happen in real time during pre market or post market   per your example if a stock is trading at $ 5 at 8 am and you put in a limit order while specifying ext to buy it at $ 5 at 8 am then your order will execute at that time and you will buy that stock at 8 am

i was in the health insurance game for 10 years and never heard of this until the affordable care act came about   to my knowledge there is no rule or regulation prohibiting it however trying to get an insurer underwrite that risk is extremely unlikely it 's the same reason why you do n't see aaa offering health insurance there is n't a contractual relationship between the church and their constituents so no underwriter worth their salt would put a reasonable price on that risk    members can easily come and go and since insurance through your employer is still the dominant distribution channel for health insurance it would be seen as an adverse risk meaning that people who could n't get it through normal channels must be getting it through the church which it would then be assumed that this person applying for coverage is an adverse risk or someone who is abnormally unhealthy   there are faith based healthcare reimbursement programs that are not health insurance and do not satisfy the aca required minimum coverages from what i 've seen and read it 's basically members of the religion or faith that pay money into the system like paying an insurance premium and they elect a board that basically evaluates each claim and pays or does n't pay it either partially or in full while this is a nice way to get your bills paid odds are it wo n't cover your $ 300,000 cancer treatment or your $ 50,000 section birth

i think you need to understand the options better before you go around calling anything worthless   $ 11k in a 1 savings account gets you just over $ 100 each year   obviously you 're not buying with your returns but it 's $ 100 more than your checking account will pay you   and you 're guaranteed to get your money back i think a cd ladder is a great way to store your emergency fund   the interest rate on a cd is typically a bit better than a regular savings account though the money is locked away and while we seem to be on the cusp of a rate increase it might not be the best time to put the money in jail   generally there is some sort of fee or lost interest from cashing a cd early   you 're still guaranteed to get your money back stock trading is probably a terrible idea   if you want some market exposure i 'd take half of the money and buy a low expense s&p etf i would n't put my whole savings if i were you or if i were me   many large brokers have an s&p etf option that you can generally buy with no commission and no loads   vanguard is a great option voo schwab has an s&p mutual fund and there are others   actively trading individual stocks is a great way to let commissions and fees erode your account   there are some startup alternatives with lower fees but personally i would stay away from individual stock picking unless you are in school for finance and have some interest in paying attention and you 're ready to possibly never see the money again   you 're not guaranteed to get your money back there are also money market accounts   these will typically pay some interest based on exposing your funds to some risk   it can be a bit better return than a savings account but i probably would n't bother an ira roth and traditional is just an account wrapper that offers certain tax benefits while placing certain restrictions on the use of some or all of the money until you reach retirement age   as a college student you should probably be more concerned about an emergency fund or traveling than retirement savings though some here may disagree with me   with your ira you can buy cds or annuities or stocks and etfs or any other kind of security   depending on what you buy inside the ira you might not be guaranteed to get your money back first you need to figure out what you 'd like to use the money for   then you need to determine when you 'd need the money for that use   then you need to determine if you can sleep at night while your stock account fluctuates a few percent each day   if you ca n't or you do n't have answers for these questions a savings account is a really low friction low risk place store money and combat inflation while you come up with answers for those questions

if the stock has low liquidity yes there could be times when there are no buyers or sellers at a specific price so if you put a limit order to buy or sell at a price with no other corresponding sellers or buyers then your order may take a while to get executed or it may not be executed at all you can usually tell if a stock has low liquidity by the small size of the average daily volume the lack of order depth and the large size of the gap between bids and offers so if a stock for example has last sale price of $ 0.50 has a highest bid price of $ 0.40 and a lowest offer price of $ and an average daily volume of 10000 share it is likely to be very illiquid so if you try to buy or sell at around the $ 0.50 mark it might take you a long time to buy or sell this stock at this price

part of your first link has this statement that i suspect you are missing however section of the flsa provides an exemption from both    minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide    executive administrative professional and outside sales employees note that executive is in that list as for the additional note to qualify for exemption employees generally must meet certain tests    regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less    than $ per week generally which means in most cases usually is not a universal qualifier and thus exceptions can exist i 'd imagine that restricted stock could be a way around some of the rules as there would be a monetary value there in the case of the stock for companies of a particular size

i do n't think anyone will take it as scrap metal because it is not allowed by the australian law   crimes currency act 1981    16 or destroying current coins or current paper    money a person shall not without the consent in writing of an authorized person intentionally or destroy any coin or paper money that is current in australia   melting it would thus be illegal and can be punished with a fine of $ 5000 or 2 years of   imprisonment or both if you try to sell it for that then you might be accessory so do n't do it   i suppose that throwing them at the garbage will count as destroying or it since it will most likely happen in the process so that may be illegal so you should n't do it   note i am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice

my parents hooked up at a highschool party when they were 17 i was born because they most definitely were not careful   that being said when my mother met my when i was 3 we lived with him in his mom 's house he had just started as a cop and we were very poor for a very long time the reason we were so poor was because my dad was investing the majority of his money investing in stocks his pension anything he could he worked for years he eventually got a new job and when he retires in a few years his pension and a handful of really good investments is going to net him just over a million dollars so this whole article is kinda bullshit to me

there are two main ways of transferring large sums of money between banks in such a situation 1 have your bank mail a cashier 's check   they may or may not charge you for this some banks charge up to $ 6 the bank i work at does n't charge at all   you have to wait for the check to go through the mail but it usually takes just a few days 2 wire the money   this could cost $ 50 or more in combined fees usually around $ 30 to send and $ 20 to receive but you get same day credit for the funds the limits to online transfers are in place to protect you so that if someone gets into your account the amount of damage they can do is limited   if you need those limits lifted temporarily check with your bank about doing so they may be willing to adjust them for you for a brief period a day or two

i think you 're mixing up being incorporated with being public a corporation is just a financially separate organization from the owner(s there might be only one owner but the company 's assets are separated from the person 's    a public company is one entity whose ownership is on the market a shareholder can sell his or her portion easily a company that decides it no longer wants to be public just becomes a private corporation with ownership of its own assets but with a few owners not many

my broker and probably many brokers provide this information in a table format under course of sale it provides the time price and volume of each trade on that day you could also view this data on a chart in some charting programs just set the interval to tick by tick and look at the volume tick by tick will basically place a mark for every trade that is taken and then the volume will tell you the size of that trade

a general mutual fund 's exact holdings are not known on a day to day basis and so technical tools must work with data furthermore the mutual fund shares nav depends on lots of different shares that it holds and the   results of the kinds of analyses that one can do for a single stock must be commingled to produce something analogous for the fund 's nav in other words there is plenty of shooting in the dark going on that being said there are plenty of   people who claim to do such analyses and will gladly sell you their results actually buy hold sell recommendations for whole fund families e.g. vanguard in the form of a monthly or weekly newsletter delivered by us mail in the old days or electronically nowadays some people who subscribe to such newsletters swear by them while others swear at them and do n't renew their subscriptions ymmv

gt movie theaters are n't full 99.9 of time   i go a lot i love seeing movies in the theater most of the time it 's barely 5 full   as far as people like me who pay full price that is negligible people like me that see a few movies a month are such a small fraction of customers    others that pay full price will still likely only see one movie per month but i ca n't tell you how many times i 've been told or over heard other people saying how the movies are way too expensive to go ever unless it 's some major event but even those are doing less and less revenue now that people can wait a few months for the dvd or watch it online   i think this model opens up millions of consumers that gave up on the high cost of taking their family to the movies and also allows far more concession sales if you have 2 kids it 's about $ 50 just on the tickets that 's not something most families can afford to do very often    personally i had always suggested a model where a subscription like this would cover mornings and when theaters are largely empty for those

one topic that i 've been trying to learn more about is the affects of the low interest rates on businesses and the economy from quantitative easing due to the amount of free money corporations have received over the last 5 years there has been a few interesting consequences there are several corporations that have borrowed money at little to no interest with the feds intentions of seeing it go back into the economy however instead corporations have used it to buy back stock which was not necessarily the plan in the first place you could definitely have a unique thesis written about something within that flow of funds if that makes no sense apologies stupid undergrad here

at the end of each period add the interest in this case an easy 1 and then subtract the payment with less than 4 months to payoff the interest here is about $ 21   instead of trying to find credit card calculators just use the more common mortgage calculator the math is the same until the final month when the credit card may handle accrued interest slightly differently   edit a finance calculator indicates payments or total payment of $ $ is interest   from my initial guess of $ 21 above

the main reason for paying your mortgage off quickly is to reduce risk should a crisis happen   if you do n't have a house payment you have much higher cash flow every month and your day to day living expenses are much lower so if an illness or job loss happens you 'll be in a much better position to handle it you should have a good emergency fund in place before throwing extra money at the mortgage so that you can cover the bigger surprises that come along there is the argument that paying off your mortgage ties up cash that could be used for other things but you need to be honest with yourself would you really invest that money at a high enough rate of return to make up your mortgage interest rate after taxes   or would you spend it on other things   if you do invest it how certain are you of that rate of return   paying off the mortgage saves you your mortgage interest rate guaranteed finally there is the more intangible aspect of what it feels like to be completely debt free with no payments whatsoever   that feeling can be a game changer for people and it can free you up to do things that you could never do when you 're saddled with a mortgage payment every month

you ca n't ask insurers to use a particular score they have a state approved underwriting model that they must follow consistently insurance companies make money by not paying claims and poor credit score including limit access to credit increases the probability that you will file a small claim why if you get into a minor accident say $ 750 of damage and have a $ 500 deductible you are much less likely to file a claim to get $ 250 if you have access to a cash or credit lines to make the repairs yourself   if you feel that you are going to be penalized for closing credit card accounts the solution is simple do n't close them other than an event where you need to sever a relationship with a co owner of an account ie you break up with your significant other dissolve a business etc or avoid paying an annual fee there is no advantage to you closing a revolving credit account ever if you can not control your spending throw the card in the eventually the credit card company will close your account for inactivity which affects your credit to a lesser degree the big exception is if you carry sufficient balances on other cards your credit utilization ratio goes up materially
