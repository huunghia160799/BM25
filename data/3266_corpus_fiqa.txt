keep in mind that in order to fund your online casino account you either had to provide credit debit card info or you had to give them your bank account number band routing number already now assuming you 've seen no fraudulent activity on your account(s since then and it was you who initiated the contact with them what they 're asking for is not totally unreasonable nor is it all that unusual   many companies require you to provide account routing info to do financial business with them which does n't automatically equate to nefarious purposes so do n't let yourself go down that rabbit hole unless there 's some other serious red flag to the situation which you have n't shared with us it is a bit odd they 'd send you a check for a portion of the winnings but maybe that 's to demonstrate good faith on their part as to why they need you to provide them information to send the remainder of your winnings that being said the suggestion to open a bank account solely for purposes of receiving your winnings is a good one   i would go a step further and once the transfer is made go to the bank in person and withdraw it in cash   then you can deposit it into your regular bank account without there being any possible connection between the two just in case you decide to indulge your fears about this good luck

i do n't know which online casino we are talking about but i would venture to say that online casinos in general are probably not the most trustworthy of businesses   caution is certainly in order   that having been said this is n't an e mail from a stranger that contacted you out of the blue you obviously trust them enough to have deposited some money with them and it seems that they now owe you money let 's assume for the moment that they are legitimate and that they sincerely want to pay out your winnings   if they are to pay you via a wire transfer they would need your account number and routing number   this information is on every check that you write   in addition if this is an international transfer they would also need your bank 's swift number or possibly an iban code it does seem odd that they would pay you a partial payment with a check but the rest has to be done via a wire transfer   you could request that they send the remainder as a check but i would imagine that if they refuse to send you a check there is nothing you can do about it if you decide to go ahead with the wire transfer you could open up a new savings account with your bank first   then you could provide the account number for this new account and if they are intending to clean out your account there will be nothing in it   for extra protection when you set up the account you could ask the bank if they can set up a savings account that will accept incoming wire deposits but no outgoing electronic withdrawals either way when you deposit the check you have and you receive this wire transfer do n't spend this money for a while   just let it sit in your account you could transfer it to your main account if you like and wait a few weeks   that way if there is a problem with these payments and your bank insists on the money back you will not be in trouble   if they send you more than they owe you and ask for some of it back it will be a clear indication of a scam   do n't send them any money back after a few weeks you should be in the clear   good luck by the way online gambling is a terrible idea   the fact that you do n't trust the casino to pay out should tell you a lot about this industry   after you receive these winnings or even if you do n't the best advice i can give you is to stop gambling

i have won a large amount of money on an online casino how reputed is the company have you done any research around it it has taken 2 months for me to see any payouts last week i received $ 2300 check from them   did you win everything in the same period if so there is no reason why they sent you a smaller check of $ 2300 instead of the full amount this should raise a red flag why would someone write multiple checks the only valid reason is you won in different months the payout for first month was $ 2300 and they sent a check the payout for next month is large amount the request for bank details that they would rather wire me the money and they are asking for my banking account number and routing number although giving bank account number and routing has some risks this is the fundamental information that is need to make a credit to your account directly you would be giving this to quite a few entities people in most countries this information is printed on every check that you write from your account is this safe or am i stupid for even considering this online world is full of traps and this could be a scam so proceed with extreme caution insist of check in worst case open a different savings account that does not allow direct debits does not have over draft etc use this to receive money and move it into your regular account

from your description the taxes may have been withheld incorrectly you were most likely a nonresident alien during your entire stay teachers and which include anyone on j status who is not a student are exempt individuals exempt from the substantial presence test unless they have already been an exempt individual during any part of 2 of the prior 6 calendar years so if you have n't been in the u.s. as an f-1 j-1 etc for at least 6 7 years before you came on j-1 this time the first two calendar years of your time on j-1 this time does not count towards the substantial presence test you said you were there for 18 months that stretches over either 2 or 3 calendar years the first two calendar years of it would be exempt from the even if it stretched into a third calendar year an 18-month period could not stretch for more than 6 months into a 3rd calendar year so even in that case you would still not meet the substantial presence test for the 3rd year since you do not meet the presence test during any of those years you were a nonresident alien for all of those years unless you decided to file jointly with a resident spouse or something nonresident aliens on j-1 are exempt from fica taxes social security tax and medicare tax for employment as a researcher that you were authorized to do on your j-1 they should not have withheld fica taxes from you you should have informed them at the beginning when you initially noticed that they did because it is a huge pain to get it back afterwards for fica taxes withheld in error you can first ask the employer to refund them and if that fails get a written statement of their refusal and then file form 843 and form with the irs however given that irs is very underfunded these days expect it to take a long time to hear back if you ever hear back

gt;when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people    i would never use the words corporations are people to describe this corporations are legal structures given a legal status by government to facilitate the cooperation of labor production and capital by having this legal status provided by government they can establish contracts and enforce them in return the corporation is subject to regulations and laws established by government    the simple fact of the matter is that if government did n't have the authority to provide certain legal statuses to corporations corporations would n't exist as such the relationship between corporations and government is rather than which the current republican party seems to think all we hear is how bad government is for business when businesses would not even exist without it we the people control the government if we wanted to we could nationalize every corporation in this country and end capitalism as we know it we basically did this in 2008 with the banks when capitalism was on it 's death bed corporations can live or die by the hand of government     that does n't sound like a process in which one concludes corporations are people my friends    gt;if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   romney never clarified what he meant by that statement and given the state of his campaign one has to wonder    gt;now if you set yourself up as inc   i have started my own business i can confirm that my personal expenses to keep me alive such as food car maintenance rent etc were not tax deductible but yet my day to day business expenses to keep it alive such as paper wages equipment etc were    edit basically i 'm just trying to say that the tax code treats corporations and people totally different as such corporations are people my friends is demonstrably false

the short answer is that it 's never the right time to buy an emerging technology as long as the technology is emerging you should expect that newer revisions will be both better and less expensive with solar specifically there are some tax credits to help the early adopters that may help you on the cost benefit analysis but in the end you still have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs now and if not whether that will change in the near future for me part of the solar benefit is the ability to generate electricity when the power goes out that option does require local battery storage however one of the benefits of using musk 's solar tiles instead of actual slate is the weight of the quartz tiles which is much lower than the weight of real slate in many cases a slate roof is heavy enough to require major reinforcement of the roof before installation the lower weight also saves significantly on shipping costs this is where musk can lower costs enough to be competitive to some of the materials he hope to compete with

you need to get the current tax software the 2013 filing software is out already even though it needs to update itself before filing as the final forms are n't ready yet then you will look carefully at schedule e to understand what gets written off i see you are looking at the $ 2200 rent vs your own rent of $ 2100 but of course the tax form does n't care about your rent you offset the expenses of that house against the income   the expenses are the usual suspects mortgage interest property tax repairs etc but there 's one big thing new landlords are prone to forgetting depreciation it 's not optional say the house cost you $ 400k. this is your basis you need to separate the value of land which is not depreciated for a condo with no land it can be as little as 10 when we bought our house for insurance purposes the land was nearly 40 of the full value say you do the research and decide 30 for land then 70 = $ depreciation is taken each year over a 27.5 year period or just over $ 10,000 per year note the forms will help you get your year 1 number as you did n't have a full year   this depreciation helps with your cash flow during the year as you should do the math and if you keep the house adjust your w4 withholdings for 2014 that lump sum you 'll get in april wo n't pay the bills each month but is recaptured on sale   at some point in the future you may save enough to buy a house where you wish to live but need to sell the rental consider a 1031 exchange it 's a way to sell a rental and buy a new one without triggering a taxable event what i do n't know is how long the new house must be a rental before the irs would then allow you to move in the same way you turned your home into a rental a rental can be turned back to a primary residence i just doubt you can do it right after the purchase as fellow member @littleadv would advise get professional advice and he 's right i 've just offered what you might consider the first year tax return with that schedule e is the toughest as it 's brand new the next year is simple in comparison   the question of selling immediately is tough only you can decide whether the risk of keeping it is too great you 're saying you do n't have the money to cover two month 's vacancy that scares me i 'd focus on up the emergency account and securing a credit line you mentioned the tax savings my opinion is that for any investment the tax tail should never wag the investing dog buy or sell a stock based on the stock not the potential tax bill for the sale in your situation the rent and expenses will cancel each other and the depreciation is a short term loan from a tax perspective if you sold today what do you net if you analyzed the numbers now what is your true income from the property each year is that return worth it a good property will provide cash flow principal reduction each year and normal increase in value this takes a bit of careful looking at the numbers you might feel you 're just breaking even but if the principal is $ 12 k less after a year that 's something you should n't ignore on the other hand an exact break even with little equity at stake offered you a leveraged property where any gains are a magnified percentage of what you have at risk   last welcome to money se consider adding some more details to your profile

if the job looks good i would n't let having to relocate stop you some companies will help you with relocation expenses like paying travel expenses the movers the security deposit on an apartment etc it does n't hurt to ask if they help with moving expenses if they say no fine i would n't expect a company to decide not to hire you   for asking such a question i would certainly not buy immediately upon moving buying a house is a serious long term commitment what if after a few months you discover that this job is not what you thought it was what if you discover that you hate the area for whatever reason etc or even if you are absolutely sure that wo n't happen it 's very hard to buy a house long distance how many trips can you make to look at different houses learn about neighborhoods get a feel for market prices etc a few years ago i moved just a couple of hundred miles to a neighboring state and i rented an apartment for about 2 years before buying a house for all these reasons assuming the company wo n't help with moving expenses do you have the cash to make the move if you 're tight it does n't have to be all that expensive if you 're six months out of college you probably do n't have a lot of stuff when i got my first job out of college i fit everything i owned in the back seat of my and tied my one piece of furniture to the roof if you ca n't fit all your stuff in your car rent a truck and a tow bar to pull your car behind get a cheap apartment you 'll probably have to pay the first month 's rent plus a security deposit you can usually furnish your first apartment from garage sales and the like very cheaply if you do n't have the cash do you have credit cards or can your parents loan you some money they might be willing to loan you money to get you out of their house

credit reports have line items that if all is well say paid as agreed a car loan almost certainly gets reported in your case it probably says the happy paid as agreed   it will continue to say that if you pay it off in full you can get the happy paid as agreed from a credit card too   you can get it by paying the balance by the due date every month or paying the or anything in between on time but you 'll blow less money in interest if you pay each bill in full each month you do n't have to carry a balance in the us you can get a free credit report once a year from each of the three credit bureaus here 's the way to do that with minimal upsell cross sell hassles   in your situation you 'd probably be smart to ask for a credit report every four months from each bureau in turn so you can see how things are going   they do n't give you your fico score for free but you do n't really care about that until you 're going for a big loan like for a condo it might be good to take a look at one of those free credit reports real soon as you prepare to close out your car loan if you need other loans consider working with a credit union they sometimes offer better interest rates and they often are diligent about making credit bureau reports for their good customers they help you build credit you mentioned wanting to cut back on insurance coverage it 's a worthy goal but it 's generally called self insuring in the business   if you cancel your collision coverage and then wreck your car you absorb the cost of replacing it so think about your personal ability to handle that kind of risk

since i ca n't vote up the answer yet i will agree with it here i find the best tactic when you call is to tell them you have an offer in hand and will use it if they do n't match the rate exactly or discount it enough to save you the trouble of going through the process of a balance transfer so if they balk and say no then walk and go to the in hand offer just remember the worst they can say is no   if you do n't even bother to ask it 's as if you did and they said no as either scenario leaves you with the same result an unchanged interest rate

the way i see it corporation tax is not fundamentally different from vat they are both a tax on revenue minus expenses just what those expenses are is different i think the main advantage of corporation tax is that it allows capital expenditure to be spread over several years although as i said this makes it more complicated and i believe that there are some capital allowances for vat as well   one advantage of vat is that sales in one country are taxed in that country before the money can be sent abroad it seems simple and fair to split the tax burden between jurisdictions according to how many sales were made in each

you get paid interest on deposits because banks only keep a fraction of the deposits on hand the rest is put to other uses such as loaning money to others if you deposit money and yield 1 interest the bank is able to fund an auto loan at 5 by saving you are actually making more capital available in the marketplace fixed or durable assets like gold real property or durable goods are different their value is based on attributes such as demand gold oil or location real property if you bought an apartment in manhattan in 1975 it appreciated greatly in value over the course of 30 years but it did so because demand for apartments in new york city grew while the supply of apartments grew more slowly the government prints money for two core reasons think of it this way money is valuable because it is money

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

pyramid schemes are illegal this is not a pyramid scheme but i would n't dive into it unless you either had some killer marketing skills or you are an extremely social and person like high school popularity contest winner level but older    the affiliate earning system is way more complicated than what you mentioned in a good way because there are many ways to earn but the biggest way to earn requires someone who knows how to throw a party or someone who absolutely loves people i do n't    i personally am documenting my experience with cbd oil and am posting my no review about everything from the product to the affiliate system on my personal fb i 'm not a people person so i do n't see me standing on a with a little mic around my cheek but oddly my candid and often funny reviews inspired many of my facebook friends to buy cbd i get $ 30 for every bottle i sell through my affiliate page this is a better way for me to earn than standing up in front of people like martha stewart    it helps if you actually like and use the product because that way you do n't feel pressured to sell i 'm experimenting with cbd because i simply ca n't relax and suffer from some major anxiety and stress attacks    results well it 's 6 am and i 'm writing to you not freaking out about work tomorrow and browsing for rick and memes i like it so far but we 'll see

yes you can withdraw the excess contribution or actually any amount you contributed for 2015 not necessarily an excess plus earnings from that withdrawn contribution by april 15 and not incur a penalty for the excess contribution it would count as if you did not contribute that amount at all the earnings would be taxed as regular income and the earnings may incur a penalty yes you can recharacterize all or part of your roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution or vice versa by april 15 recharacterization means you pretend the contribution was originally made as a traditional ira contribution and did not involve roth ira at all conversion is something very different and can only go from traditional to roth not the other way around you are likely not eligible to deduct that traditional ira contribution so you will have to report it as a non deductible traditional ira contribution on a 2015 form 8606 part 1 note that after you 've it as a traditional ira contribution you can also then convert that traditional ira money to a roth ira if you want achieving the same state as what you have now contributing to a traditional ira and then converting to a roth ira is called a backdoor roth ira contribution if you do n't have any existing pre tax money in traditional ira or other iras then this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution except with no income limits when you convert the earnings you have made since contributing will be taxed as income if you had done the backdoor originally to begin with convert right after contributing you would have had no earnings in between and no tax to pay but since if you do the conversion now you have waited so long you are disadvantaged by having to pay tax on the earnings in between if you convert you will have to fill out form 8606 part 2 for the year you convert 2016

on the statement it now tracks how much is contributed to the account    pre and post tax this is the key your withdrawals will be proportional assuming you have contributed 90 in regular contributions pre tax and 10 in roth post tax when you withdraw $ 1000 it will be $ 900 from the regular taxed fully and $ 100 from the roth not taxed assuming its a qualified distribution earnings attributed proportionally to the contributions i agree with you that it is not the best option and would also prefer separate accounts but with 401k the account is per employee instead of doing 401k roth non roth consider switching to regular 401k and roth ira then you can separate the funds easily as you wish

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

you 're ignoring the fact that you still had the taxes from the $ 5500 so $ left over when making the traditional ira contribution   so yes the roth ira grew without further taxing more than the traditional ira did but you could 've just as easily invested that $ in the same investments while you 'd owe taxes on them true you 'd still earn a of money   that 's another $ you 've earned not tax free but with gains at the 15 is still $   so you now have $ in the roth available tax free or you have $ available at a 10 or so average rate 12 if you like though i think you 'll find it 's more like 10    say $ plus $ from the not sheltered income after taxes for $ after taxes so you make about $ 2000 more by using the traditional ira for $ 5500 and then just investing the rest in a long term account   the math might be slightly worse if you invest in something that has regular dividend taxes due but if you 're careful to use tax favored investments you should be okay and even if you do n't you 'll still end up ahead in the end if you make the same exact investment as your tax sheltered account ultimately the question is are you paying more in taxes now or later comparing now marginal rate to later average rate   if you are paying more in taxes now then traditional ira plus invest the rest   if you 're paying more later then roth ira

the short answer is that it depends on the industry in other words margin alone even in comparison to peers will not be a sufficient index to track company success   i 'll mention apple quickly as a special case that has managed to charge a premium margin for a mass market product   few companies can achieve this as with all investment analysis you need to have a very clear understanding of the industry i.e. what is normal for debt equity gearing margin cash on hand as well as of the barriers to entry which competitors face a higher than normal margin may swiftly be undermined by competitors apple aside   any company offering perpetual above the odds returns may just be a ponzi scheme bernie etc   more important than high margins or high profits over some short term track is consistency of approach an ability to whether adverse cyclical events and deep investment in continuity i.e. the entire company does n't come to a grinding halt when a crucial staff member retires

in this case it looks like the interest is simply the nominal daily interest rate times number of days in the period from that you can use a spreadsheet to calculate the total payment by trial and error with the different number of days in each period any formula would be very complicated in the more usual case where the interest charge for each period is the same the formula is m = where is multiplication ^ is is division sorry do n't know if there 's a way to show formulas cleanly on here p = original principle r = growth factor per payment period i.e. interest rate + 100 divided by 100 e.g. 1 > 1.01 n = number of payments note the growth factor above is per period so if you have monthly payments it 's the rate per month the last payment may be different because of rounding errors unequal number of days per period or other technicalities using that formula here wo n't give the right answer because of the unequal periods but it should be close let 's see times an average of days per period gives + 1 = ^ ^ 5 1 = further off than i expected but ballpark

if you 're looking for a purely financial answer ignoring the social environmental aspects there are a few different ways you can look at it for these types of improvements the simplest is a payback calculation   how long would it take you to recoup the initial costs    for example if the entire installation cost $ 5,000 including any tax credits and you save $ 100 per month i 'm making both numbers up you 'll pay back your investment in 50 months or about 4 years    note that if you borrow money to do the improvement then your payback period is longer because you 're reducing the amount that you 're saving each month by paying interest if you 're deciding between different uses for the money like investing or paying down other debt then you can look at the return that you 're getting   using the same example you are spending $ 5,000 and getting $ 100 per month back for a 24 annual return $ 1,200 $ 5,000 which is better than you can get on almost anything but a 401(k match meaning do n't stop your 401(k contributions to do this either the decision on whether or wait or not then becomes will the price drop faster than the amount of savings you will realize   so if you will save $ 100 per month in your electric bill is the price of the complete installation going down by more than $ 100 each month   if not you 'd be better off buying now and start paying back the investment sooner

budgeting is the key   saying that you need to eat out less and cook more is good but ultimately difficult for some people because it is very difficult to measure how much eating out is too much instead help him set up a monthly budget luckily he 's already got some built in motivation he 's got a saving goal trip with a deadline when you set up the budget start here figuring out how much per month he needs to save to meet his goal   after you 've put the saving goal and the fixed monthly bills into the budget address what he has left put a small amount of money into a fast food category and a larger amount into a grocery category if he spends everything in his fast food budget and still has the desire to go out he 'll need to raid his grocery budget and if that is depleted he 'll need to raid his vacation budget by doing this it will be made very clear to him that he must choose between going out and taking the trip   in my opinion using budgeting software makes the whole budgeting process easier see this answer and this answer for more detailed recommendations on using software for budgeting

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

debt never rots or with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest nothing in the natural world does this   biological populations do this when their growth is not checked a virus in an epidemic situation comes to mind it grows exponentially until it meets its natural limit the capacity of its host population to sustain it which crashes due to the virus effects so i 'd say debt rots only when it pushes the economy to such extremes that a political revolution encompasses both debtor and creditor and the slate is wiped clean

one reason why some merchants in the us do n't accept discover is that the fee the store is charged is higher than the average generally a portion of transaction fee for the network and the issuing bank goes to the rewards program in some cases a portion of the interest can also be used to fund these programs some cards will give you more points when you carry a balance from one month to the next therefore encouraging consumers to have interest charges this portion of the program will be funded from the interest charges profits rewards some rewards are almost always redeemed cash once the amount of charges gets above a minimum threshold some are almost never redeemed miles with high requirements and tough blackout periods   credit cards that do n't understand how their customers will use their cards can run into problems if they offer a great rewards program that encourages use but pays too high a percentage of points earned can lead to problems this is especially true when a great percentage of users pay in full each month this hurt citibank in the 1990 's they had a card with no annual fee forever and a very high percentage never had to pay interest people to the card and kept it as an emergency card because they knew it would never have a annual fee

i do n't think retail cares so much about being taken for a few bps here and there but more so about the insane volatility that is the new normal in markets this vol which in many cases can be tracked back to hft has had a negative feedback loop that resulted in lower volumes across the board   i do n't think retail cares about a few bps here and there but if the entire system is based on trust in market efficiency and computers make them less efficient by purposefully manipulating the system retail might just not chose to play any more   think of it like baseball vs. football   football has salary caps and as such all teams have a fair shot at winning every year baseball does n't and a few teams with the biggest budgets consistently win year over year yeah it 's great if you 're a red sox giants or fan but many other cities in the country do n't care about baseball much anymore and favor football look at viewership stats by market over time hft is the same way it 's great if you have the money to compete in that system but by destroying the integrity of the system itself many participants just stop caring as much and go elsewhere

will buying a flat which generates $ 250 rent per month be a good decision whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things including the current and future supply demand for rental units in your particular area there are many questions on this site about this topic and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider i just want to focus on this point you raised i personally think yes because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it in my opinion the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk not an absolute increase in value first consider buying a house to live in instead of to rent   if you pay off your mortgage before your retire then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities property taxes and repairs this gives you a relatively known fixed requirement of cash outflows if the value of property goes up by the time you retire it does n't cost you anything extra because you already own your house if the value of property goes down by the time you retire then you do n't save anything because you already own your house if you instead rent your whole life and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage then when you retire you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month by the time you retire your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time if the value of property goes up by the time you retire you will have to pay more on rent if the value of property goes down by the time you retire you will save money on rent you will have larger savings but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain because you do n't know what the market price for rent will be you can see that because you need to put a roof over your own head just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising so buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk this is called a natural hedge where two competing risks can mitigate each other just by existing this does n't mean buying a house is always the right thing to do it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site or on google now consider buying a house to rent out to other people   in the extreme scenario assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible maybe by the time you retire you own a small apartment building with 11 units where you live in one of them as an example and you have no other savings before owning your own home was among other pros and cons a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up but now the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations that is if rent goes up by $ 100 after you retire your rental income goes up by $ 1,000 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by $ 100 if rent goes down by $ 50 after you retire your rental income goes down by $ 500 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by $ 50 you can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market this risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home because at least in that case you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations which you know you will need to pay one way or another this is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio that means buying some stocks some bonds etc if you invest to heavily in a single thing then you bear huge risks for that particular market in the case of property each investment is so large that you are often if you invest heavily in it you ca n't just buy a house $ 100 at a time like you could a stock or bond of course my above examples are very simplified i am only trying to suggest the underlying principle not the full complexities of the real estate market note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation cost of living real estate is only one of them

when economies are strong it is particularly to have a single currency as it makes trade and tourism simpler and helps reduce costs the problem comes when individual member economies get into trouble because the eurozone is a loose grouping of nations there is no direct equivalent of the us federal government to coordinate a response there is instead an odd mixture of national and central government that makes it harder to get a unified approach to the economy ok it 's maybe not so different to the us in reality   this lack of flexibility means that some of the key levers of international finance are compromised for example a weak economy ca n't float its currency to improve exports similarly individual country 's interest rates ca n't be adjusted to balance spending i suspect the main reason though is political and based on concepts of sovereignty and national pride the uk does the majority of its trade with the eurozone so the pros would possibly outweigh the cons but the uk as a whole and some of our papers in particular have always regarded europe with suspicion most only speak english and find france and germany a strange and obtuse place the almost common language makes it easier to relate to the us and canada than our near neighbours it seems the perception amongst the political establishment is that any attempt to join the euro is political suicide while that is the case it is unlikely to happen purely from a personal perspective i 'd welcome the euro except it means a lot of the products i routinely buy would become a lot more expensive if price is for an example compare the price of the ipod touch in the uk £ to the french pay £ at the current exchange rate which is close to 25 more ouch see also my question about canada adopting the us dollar

it looks like businesses selling services like software downloads from outside the eu to the uk have to register for vat if the amount of such sales goes over the uk vat registration threshold if the value of the taxable supplies you make is over a specified    threshold then you must register for vat so it seems plausible that this business does have some requirement to charge vat on its sales but clearly it should have done so at the time of sale not months later as you say uk and eu law require that prices are displayed including relevant taxes since this business is in the us they might be able to claim that those rules do n't apply to them but i 'm not aware of even us businesses being able to claim sales tax from a us customer months after originally making a sale and it goes against all reasonable principles of law if they would be able to do it so the business should really just accept that they screwed up and they 'll now have to take the hit and pay the tax themselves they can work as if the pre tax price was $ = $ leaving $ they need to hand over to hmrc i do n't think there 's any legal way they can demand money from you now and certainly for such a low sum of money there 's no practical way they could i ca n't find anything definitive one way or the other but i suppose it 's possible that hmrc would consider you the importer under these circumstances and so liable for the vat yourself but i do n't know of any way to actually report this to hmrc or pay them the money and again given the amount there 's no realistic chance they 'd want to chase you for it in your shoes i would either ignore the email or write back and politely tell them that they should have advertised the cost at the time and you 're not willing to pay extra now and you might want to keep an eye on the card you used to pay them to make sure they do n't try to just charge it anyway edit as pointed out in a comment the company behind this or at least one with a very similar problem and wording in their emails did end up acknowledging that they ca n't actually do this and that they 'll need to pay the tax out of the money they already collected as i described above it seems they did n't contact the people they originally emailed to let them know this though there 's some more discussion here

all standard mortgage promissory notes mandate payments are due on the first of every month i can almost guarantee the note you signed has this provision   most lenders offer a grace period of generally 15 days before they assess a late charge but the payment is late on the 2nd   people have become incorrectly accustomed to believe that the payment is due between the 1st and 15th if they are servicing your loan for another investor a private investor etc they may have contractual requirements to begin collection activities by a certain date so they are within the rights you granted them   if these calls really bug you you can start to adjust your cashflow so you can perhaps make your payment a few days ahead of the first each month

you could have both options exercised and assigned to you on the same day but i do n't think you could lose money on both on the same day the reason is that while exercises are immediate assignments are processed after the markets close at the end of each day see for details so you would get both assignments at the same time that night the net effect should be that you do n't own any stock someone would put you the stock then it 'd be called away and you do n't have the options anymore you should have incoming cash of $ 1500 selling the stock to the call and outgoing cash of $ 1300 buying from the put right so you would have no more options but $ 200 more cash in your account in the morning you bought at 13 and sold at 15 this options position is an agreement to buy at 13 and sell at 15 at someone else 's option the way you lose money is if one of the options is n't exercised while the other is i.e. if the stock is below 13 so nobody is going to opt to buy from you at 15 but they 'll sell to you at 13 or above 15 so nobody is going to opt to sell to you at 13 but they 'll buy from you at 15 you make money if neither is exercised you keep the premium you sold for or both are exercised you keep the gap between the two plus the premium having both exercised is surely rare since early exercise is rare to begin with and tends to happen when options are deep in the money so you 'd expect both to be exercised if both are deep in the money at some point having both be exercised on the same day ca n't be common but it 's maybe most likely just before expiration with minimal time value if the stock moves around quickly so both options are in the money at some point during the day

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

that is a decision you need to make but some of the pros and cons you could consider to help your decision making include pros if bought at the right time in the property cycle and in a good growth area it can help you grow your net worth much quicker than having money in the bank earning near zero interest you would be replacing rent payments with mortgage payments and if your mortage payments are less than your current rent you will have additional money to pay for any expenses on the property and have a similar cashflow as you do now you will be able to deduct your interest payments on the mortgage against your income if you are in the usa thus reducing the tax you pay you will have the security of your own house and not have to worry about moving if the landlord wants you out after your lease expires cons if bought in a bad area and at the top of the property cycle you may never make any capital gains on the property and in fact may lose money on it long term if the mortgage payments are more than your current rent you may be paying more especially at the start of your mortgage if you buy a house you are generally stuck in one spot it will be harder to move to different areas or states as it can cost a lot of money and time to sell and buy elsewhere if renting you can generally just give notice and find a new place to rent property maintenance costs and taxes could be a drain on your finances especially if the mortgage repayments are more than your current rent if your mortgage payments and property expenses are way more than your current rent it may reduce what you could be investing in other areas to help increase your net worth

you quote a rate 2.75 and then quote a margin 1.75   the margin is usually an addition to some base rate   how is the margin expressed in the figures you have   is it included in the rate or in addition to it as for the other stuff it looks like the rate can go up at most 1 per year up to a maximum of 5 increase   the first adjustment cap is also 1   that just says that your first rate increase is capped the same as subsequent increases if the margin is already included and the increases are based on your initial rate then this puts you at a maximum of 7.75 you must verify this   i do n't have your loan documents and again why would you want to risk an increase at all   you have a decent fixed rate mortgage already   that still does n't make sense to me   going from 2.75 to 7.75 as above can increase your monthly payment by over 40

i struggle to see the value to this risk from the standpoint of your mother in law   this is not a small amount of money for a single person to lend to a single person ignoring your personal relationship    right now using a blended rate of about 8 and a 5 year payment period your cost on that $ 50,000 is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 11,000 with a monthly payment around $ using the same monthly payment but paying your mil at 5 you 'll complete the loan about 3.5 months sooner and save about $ 5,000 she will make about $ 6,000 in interest over 5 years against a $ 50,000 outlay alternatively you can just prioritize payments to the more expensive loans   it 's difficult to work out a total cost comparison without your expected payoff timelines and you 're currently paying toward all the loans   i 'm sure a couple hours with a couple of spreadsheets could yield a plan that would net you a savings substantially close to the $ 5,000 you 'd save by risking your mother in law 's money a lot of people think personal lending risk is about the relationship between the people involved but there 's more to it than that it 's not about you and your wife separating it 's not about the awkward dinner and conversations if you lose your job   something might physically happen to you you could become disabled or die   right now that 's an extremely diversified and calculated risk taken by a gigantic lender unless your mother in law is very wealthy this is not nearly enough reward to assume this sort of risk in my opinion   her risk far outpaces your potential five year savings if you wanted to pursue this as a means of paying interest to a family member rather than the bank i 'd only borrow an amount i budgeted and intended to pay within this single year   say $ 10,000 against the highest interest loan

index fund will also generally charge lower fees than an actively managed mutual fund where the manager tries to pick which stocks to invest for you while the actively managed fund might give you better returns by investing in good companies instead of every company in the index that does n't always work out and the fees can eat away at that advantage stocks on average are expected to yield an annual return of 4 after inflation consider that when you see an expense ratio of 1 index funds should charge you more like or so possibly more if it 's an exotic index the question is what sort of index you 're going to invest in the standard and poor 's 500 s&p 500 is a major index and if you see someone talking about the performance of a mutual fund or investment strategy there 's a good chance they 'll compare it to the return of the s&p 500 moreover there are a variety of index funds and exchange traded funds that offer very good expense ratios e.g. vanguard 's etf charges very cheap you can also find some funds which try to get you exposure to the entire world stock market e.g. vanguard total world stock etf nyse vt an index fund is probably the ideal way to start a portfolio easy and you get a lot of diversification later when you have more money available you can consider adding individual stocks or investing in specific sectors or regions someone else suggested brazil russia indo china or brics having some money invested in that region is n't necessarily a bad idea but putting all or most of your money in that region would be if brics are more of your portfolio then they are of the world economy your portfolio is n't balanced also while these countries are experiencing a lot of economic growth that does n't always mean that the companies that you own stock in are the ones which will benefit small businesses and new ventures may make up a significant part of that growth bond funds are useful when you want to diversify your portfolio so that it 's not all stocks there 's a bunch of portfolio theory built around asset allocation strategies the idea is that you should try to maintain a target mix of assets whatever the market 's doing the basic simplified guideline about investing for retirement says that your portfolio should have your in bonds e.g. a 30-year old should have 30 in bonds a old 50 this helps maintain a balance between the volatility of your portfolio the stock market 's ups and downs and the rate of return you want to earn money when you can but when it 's almost time to spend it you do n't want a sudden stock market crash to wipe it all out bonds help preserve that value but do n't have as nice of a return the other idea behind asset allocation is that if the market changes e.g. your stocks go up a lot while your bonds stagnate you rebalance and buy more bonds if the stock market subsequently crashes you move some of your bond money back into stocks this basically means that you buy low and sell high just by maintaining your asset allocation this is generally more reliable than trying to time the market and move into an asset class before it goes up and move out before it goes down market timing is just speculation you get better returns if you guess right but you get worse returns if you guess wrong commodity funds are useful as another way to diversify your portfolio and can serve as a little bit of protection in case of crisis or inflation you can buy gold silver platinum and palladium etfs on the stock exchanges having a small amount of money in these funds is n't a bad idea but commodities can be subject to violent price swings moreover a bar of gold does n't really earn any money and owning a share of a precious metals etf will incur administrative storage and insurance costs to boot a well run business does earn money assuming you 're saving for the long haul retirement or something several decades off my suggestion for you would be to start by investing most of your money in index funds to match the total world stock market with something like the aforementioned nyse vt for instance a small portion in bonds and a smaller portion in commodity funds for all the negative stuff i 've said about market timing it 's pretty clear that the bond market is very expensive right now and so are the commodities then as you do additional research and determine what sort investments are right for you add new investment money in the places that you think are appropriate stock funds bond funds commodity funds individual stocks sector specific funds actively managed mutual funds et cetera and try to maintain a reasonable asset allocation have fun most of your investment money you should have a separate fund for emergencies and do n't invest money in stocks if you know you 're going need it within the next few years

a lot of smaller and/or weaker countries did not have much choice when germany and france decided to rename the german mark as the euro as most of their trade was already in marks   it was even common for their population to have their savings in marks    so the question was do we wish to have to use the euro    with or without a seat on the board it was a no brainer for them at the time the uk has a lot of trade with the usa and other countries outside of the euro zone so we are unlikely to have to join the euro     so in the end it comes down to this point   if the british voters trust a uk government they elected more or less than an government mostly elected by people in the other countries i do n’t think the uk will be joining the euro anytime soon but everything can and will change with the passage of time   after all the usa used to be part of the pound trading zone and please can you pay us all the back dated tax you stop paying after a little tea party update given what has just happen to grease and spain and the conservative party has the most seats in the uk parliament i do n’t think the uk will not be joining the euro for the next 5 years at least

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

the seriousness of your situation depends on whether your girlfriend was owed a refund for each tax return she failed to file or whether she owed additional money if she owed money on one or more of the tax returns she failed to file stop it is time to consult a lawyer at the very least you need to contact an accountant who specialises in this sort of thing she will owe interest and penalties and may be liable for criminal prosecution there are options available and lawyers who specialise in this sort of thing e.g. this one from a simple google search if she is in this position you need professional help and you need it soon so you can make a voluntary disclosure and head off criminal prosecution assuming the taxes are fairly simple you are likely looking at a few thousand dollars but probably less than $ 7,500 for professional help there will be substantial penalties assessed as well for any taxes owing if you wait until the cra starts proceedings you are most likely looking at $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 assuming the matter is not too complicated and would be facing the possibility of a jail term not exceeding five years if she was due a refund on every single one of the tax returns she failed to file or at least if she did not owe additional money you are probably in a situation you can deal with yourself she will want to file all of the tax returns as soon as possible but will not be assessed a penalty i have personally filed taxes several months late a number of times when i was owed a refund you may still want to consider professional help but it is probably not necessary under no circumstances should she allow her father near her finances again ever you should also be careful to trust any responses to this question including my response because we are unlikely to be professional accountants i certainly am not you are well outside the abilities of an h&r block accountant in this matter and need a real certified accountant and/or a lawyer who specialises in failure to file cases

the key two things to consider when looking at similar identical etfs is the typical or indicative spread and the trading volume and size of the etf just like regular stocks thinly traded etf 's often have quite large spreads between buy and sell in the 1.5 range in some cases this is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants aps face issues in general with stock etfs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue as the creation redemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust it 's consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor on point 3 no this would create an arbitrage which an authorized participant would quickly take advantage of worth reading up about the creation and redemption mechanism here is a good place to start to understand the exact way this happens in etfs as it 's very key to how they work

unless you have a good handle on what niches the startups of were entering i think it is hard to get a handle on why there is a decline   is this a decline in the number of restaurants being started or is this a decline in the number of internet startups   the reasons will depend on the character of the startups   one trend i think is pretty common is the decline of the local market   the internet and free shipping makes the internet the growth area for specialized commerce   so many commerce niches are threatened it would take a real to consider a start up in a niche that is essentially being the local distributor for something people can get more cheaply on line     then there is the idea that   local does n't mean the same thing as it did   even 30 years ago as people drive further to get the essentials at big box stores   a declining main street of a small town or a declining mall in the suburbs is n't an attractive place to be an entrepreneur   on the other hand competing in the big box strip on the edge of town has its own challenge   people are shopping at hr and you need a huge storefront   and/or a huge advertising budget even to get noticed     if the decline is in the number of restaurant startups   it might be that this is related to a decline in disposable income    if it is a decline in internet startups   perhaps it is just showing a maturing of the industry from a fast growth phase where all sorts of unfilled niches were open for the quick entrepreneur to a more mature market where the internet is consolidating with a few behemoths taking up all the oxygen

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

first of all insurance never covers the cost of the item it is almost always a partial payout at best for example a typical house in the northeast us where i live that costs $ 300,000 will have the actual house valued at maybe $ and rest of the value will be in the land therefore the insured value will typically be $ 100,000 the only problem is that to actually rebuild the house might easily cost $ 250,000 so your idea that some kinds of insurance allows the beneficiary to recoup their loss is usually never true as you say from an actuarial point of view insurance is a sheer waste of money for example a typical house has maybe a 0.5 chance of burning down every year in other words out of 2000 houses maybe 1 will burn down every year so lets say you got $ 100,000 of insurance on your house then the value of that policy would be $ 100,000 2000 = $ 50 per year an insurance company will charge around $ 700 per year for the policy that means you are basically $ 650 down the toilet every year to maintain that policy the reason why they do this is what says above they are buying peace of mind a psychological product in other they imagine they are somehow safe so even though they are losing money paying it makes them feel as though they are not losing money it 's delusional but then again most people have a lot of delusions of which insurance is just one of many

look at a mixture of low fee index funds low fee bond funds and cds the exact allocation has to be tailored to your appetite for risk if you only want to park the money with essentially no risk of loss then you need fdic insured products like cds or a money market account as opposed to a money market fund which is not fdic insured however as others have said interest rates are awful now   since you are in your early 30 's and expect to keep this investment for 10 + years you can probably tolerate a bit of risk also considering speaking to a tax professional to determine the specific tax benefits drawbacks of one investment strategy funds and cds versus another e.g. real estate

my general rule of thumb with start ups is do n't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job if you were a single man or your wife also could provide income for the family then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider i suggest a more cautious route it may be frustrating to deal with the of work but if you really want to see that start up i would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start up full time it will be a lot of work so would a start up but it is less risky especially considering your family situation if you really hate what you are doing i would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work maybe there is something that you have overlooked and do n't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified as long as it does n't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing

whenever an article like this pops up people love to point out the fact people may not have much in savings because savings accounts are effectively stagnant money however that many people with certainly means it 's because they do n't really have any money to begin with and not that it 's invested elsewhere right

i want to caveat that i am not an active investor in australia you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advice but since you came here i can give you some generalized advice   when investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment the 50 rule and the 2 or 1 rule    the 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service   if you are bringing in $ 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities taxes repair capital expenditures advertising lawn care etc that leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow   as this is your first property and it is in a relatively bad neighbourhood you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding the 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 2 percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150,000   if the rent is 1,500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3,000 a month it probably is a good investment   there are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property   if a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal   these rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis they may need to be adapted to you market   for example these rules will not hold in most all big cities

so in a sense i can think of the employees option holders as another investor    that makes sense but many of the examples i 'm finding online are still confusing me based on the example above it seems like option holders would be paying the same exercise price as the vc per this seems uncommon    gt the exercise price of employee options the price per share needed to actually own the shares is often less than the original issue price paid by the most recent investor who holds preferred stock     in reality would option holders receive say 40 using example above for their $ 6 m in exercise value due to receiving common stock with the founder being diluted to even further

i would steer well clear of this the risk is that they take your money but do n't pay the bank this would n't require dishonesty what if they run into financial trouble any money of yours that they have that has n't gone on to the bank yet might end up paying off other debts instead of yours it 's not clear if the idea is that you are paying them all the money up front or will be making payments over time but either way if they do n't clear the lien with the bank then the bank can come after the car no matter who is in physical possession of it that would leave you without either the money or the car in theory you 'd have a legal claim against the seller but in reality you 'd probably find it hard to collect

i believe the only thing you have n't mentioned to him is the possibility that his activity is criminally fraudulent i would sit him down and say something substantially similar to the following we 've talked about your investment before and i know you believe it 's fine   i just want to make sure you understand that this is very likely fraudulent activity   i know you believe in it but you 've said you do n't understand how or why it works   the problem with that is that if it is a fraud you ca n't protect yourself from criminal prosecution because you did n't understand what you were doing   the prosecutor will ask you if you asked others to give you or the organization money and then they will you based on trying to defraud others it does n't matter whether you did it on purpose or just because you believed the people you are investing in so i very strongly advise you to understand exactly what the system is and how it works and then make sure with a lawyer that it 's legal   if it is then hey you 've learned something valuable   but if it 's not then you will save yourself a whole lot of trouble and anguish down the road if you step away before someone you attract to the investment decides to talk to their accountant or lawyer   a civil lawsuit may be bad but if you 're criminally prosecuted it will be so much worse now that i 've said my piece i wo n't talk to you about it anymore or bother you about it i wish you luck and hope that things work out fine i would n't talk to the police or suggest that i 'd do anything of that nature without proof then there 's no real way to start an investigation anyway and unfortunately scams like this are incredibly hard to investigate so the police often spend little to no time on them without a high level insider giving up evidence and associates chances are good nothing would happen to your friend one day the organization will disappear and he wo n't recover any more money but there 's a distinct possibility that when that happens the people below him will come for him and he wo n't be able to look further up the chain for help perhaps the threat of illegal activity will be enough to prevent him from defrauding others but if not i think at least you can let it go and know that you 've done everything for him that might work

this may sound very tongue in cheek but the best thing you can invest in is to raise your income in order to increase your retirement savings   how much are you able to contribute to retirement now   i think you would be lucky to do $ and most months probably less than that   however if you were making like 60k year and allowed a little lifestyle bloat you could probably easy put away 20k year   once you are able to do that the savings you can manage now will be quickly    often times when people consider having their money work for them they often neglect to factor risk   prior to investing one should have a proper emergency fund in place   that is 6 months or so of living expenses in a nice safe savings account   those earn about 1.25 these days which is pretty meager but it does earn something    once the emergency fund is in place one can invest with impunity   without it you will have to liquidate investments if economic calamity strikes you   this could be done at a loss furthering the harm done by the calamity    increase your income and create an emergency fund   do those things first

if you 're talking about an etf trading on arca it 's probably because of the opening auction the match price is the price that maximizes the volume that can be executed within the auction collars the core open auction will use the match price closest to the closing price of the previous trading day based on normal market hours if more than one indicative match price is valid the core opening auction does n't really take the opening session activity into account as you can see the market runs an auction and whatever price clears the most volume within certain limits is the opening print

invest because you are young and have lots of time i recommend opening an investment account and putting most 1000 £ or all in something like an s&p 500 index fund or etf start building   your savings now because compound growth over time will build significant wealth you can still invest the other in something a bit less volatile if you think you 'll need the money in < 5 years if you expect your income to continue to grow and you expect to have extra cash every month for the foreseeable future i 'd just put it all in an index fund you can weather any temporary market swings and in the worst case scenario you can always sell a few shares if you need the cash the advantage of an index fund is that it has very low fees and it 's an invest and forget approach you do n't have to watch the market every day because your money will simply match the market and in the long term the market does much better than most managed funds or etfs

no you can sell anytime i am in pedantic mode sorry the way the question is worded implies that you can sell only if it rises you are welcome to sell at a loss too   yes the fund will not issue a dividend with every dividend it receives it 's more typical that they issue dividends quarterly so the shares will increase by the amount of the dividends and on the ex div date drop by that amount the remaining value goes up and down of course i am speaking only of the extra value created by the retained dividends

it 's just possible that if you have your home appraised probable cost a few hundred $ and the value is sufficiently higher than what the mortgage company is owed that they will let this slide since they are covered many banks at least allow secured lines of credit against the equity in your home and allow the amount of the loan to increase if as the value of the property goes up and your equity increases however i 'd run this by the mortgage company before investing in the appraisal since they may not be as flexible this way as the banks i 've dealt with and in any case it 's a gamble unless you are certain of the value of your property

note i am not a lawyer this is my personal opinion and interpretation first your source is european law which obviously does n't apply outside of the eu the eu can not make laws that bind entities in other countries so you can not claim that the vat was needed to be mentioned second if you owe something you owe it it does n't matter if it was forgotten to be mentioned at best you can say that under those circumstances you do n't want the software anymore and i would assume you can send it back and get your money back minus a fee for having it used for a while this gets quite difficult to calculate clearly so it 's probably not a good avenue to follow for you as the company has to send the vat to your country they will not be allowed to keep a dime of it and have to bear the complete cost for the handling it is a debt you have to your government they are just the entity responsible for collecting it still if you just ignore them they will probably suck it up and your government will also not do a thing to you if they only have your email address they have no way of knowing if you even still have use this address for all they know it could be you never got it they also can not simply charge your card as they probably do n't have the card data any more they are not supposed to keep it after the transaction is complete and they thought it was complete at the time all in all you should be safe to ignore it it 's between you and your god consciousness if you feel obliged to pay it as technically you owe it

well he could negotiate with the bank to pay off the loan before the foreclosure takes effect that would obviously cost him a large pile of cash but might remove the foreclosure and possibly the late payments from his record but the real answer is that having signed the note he should have been making sure payments occurred so it never got close to foreclosure that 's what he promised the bank he would do having failed to do so he really is n't in a position to complain when they tell other businesses that he did n't meet that promise

first and foremost you should do more research on credit cards and what everything means   as expressed by others the balance transfer fee is not what you think it is   credit cards can be great they can also quickly erode your credit score and your standing   so understanding the basics is very important    the credit card that is right for you should have the following criteria   the first two points should be straight forward you should not have to pay a cc company for the privilege to use their card   they should pay you through perks and rewards   it should also be a cc that can be used for what you need it for   if you travel internationally a lot and the cc you choose only works within the us then what good is it the third point is where you need to ask yourself what you do a lot and if a cc can offer rewards through travel miles or cash back or other bonuses based on your lifestyle   the transfer fee is not what you think it is people who already are carrying debt on another credit card and would like to transfer that debt to another credit card would be interested in finding a fee or a low   people do this to get a batter rate or to get away from a bad credit card   if one charges 28 and another charges 13 well it makes sense to transfer existing debt over to the 13 provided they do n't crush you on fees   since you have no credit card debt assumption based on the fact you want to build your credit you should ask yourself for what purpose and how often do you plan to use the credit card   would this card be just for emergencies and wo nt be used on daily purchases then a credit card that offers 3 cash back on gasoline purchases is not for you   if you however love to travel and plan to use your credit card for a lot of purchases or have a few large purchases insurance tuition etc then get a credit card that provides rewards like miles   it really comes down to you and your situation there are numerous websites dedicated to the best credit card for any situation    the final thing i will say is what i mentioned at the beginning its important cc 's can be a tool to establish and improve your credit worthiness they can also be a tool to destroy your credit worthiness so be careful and make smart choices on what you use your card for   a credit score is like a mountain it requires a slow and steady discipline to reach the top but one and that credit score can tumble quickly

you walk into the finance company with a written quote from the supplier for the equipment you want to buy you then fill out forms and sign a promissory note the finance company then writes out a check to the supplier for the amount of the quoted equipment usually you need to provide at least 3 things they will require you to provide your social security number and sign a document allowing them to check your credit history which they will look up using the social security number note that banks will generally give better rates on a personal loan than a finance company people usually only use finance companies when their credit is so bad that a bank will not loan them money heating and cooling companies that provide equipment will often loan the money to buy that equipment as a point of advice it is generally poor financial management to take out personal loans and may indicate a person that is wasting money or be in financial difficulties for personal loan items furniture cars clothing jewelry etc you are far better off saving money to buy the item not borrowing beyond your means if you need a new furnace and it is an emergency for example if it were winter which it is not and your furnace could not be repaired then that might justifiable but borrowing money at a high rate to just upgrade a furnace or get a luxury like ac is unwise

you will not benefit at tax time like you did with your initial contributions because you have already benefited and are simply repaying your withdrawn contributions however capital gains are not taxed inside of your rrsp until you withdraw the money let 's say you have $ 10,000 to repay and have all the money now it makes sense to repay it immediately whatever interest or capital gains you make inside of the rrsp are not taxed however your $ 10,000 contribution this year will not offer you any deductions on your tax return there are exactly two reasons i can see to not immediately repay the full amount if able first you may need the money for an emergency fund and there are significant implications for removing money from your rrsp in such a case second if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket when you retire it may not make sense to put any money into an rrsp right now almost certainly you want to repay the entire lump sum if able

i would not sell unless the stock is starting to fall in price if you are a long term investor you can review the weekly chart on a weekly basis to determine if the stock is still up trending regarding hd below is a weekly chart for the last 4 years   basically if the price is making higher highs hh and higher lows it is up trending if it starts to make lower lows ll followed by lower highs then the uptrend is over and the stock could be entering a downtrend with hd the price has been up trending but seems to now be hitting some headwinds it has been making some followed by some hls throughout the last 2 years it did make a ll in late august 2015 but then recovered nicely to make a new hh so the uptrend was not broken in early november 2016 it made another ll but this time it seems to be followed by a in mid december 2016 this could be clear evidence that the uptrend may be ending the final confirmation would be if the price drops below the early november low of $ the orange line if price drops below this price it would be confirmation that the uptrend is over and this should be the point at which you should sell your hd shares you could place an automatic stop loss order just below $ so that you do n't even need to monitor the stock frequently another indication that the uptrend may be in trouble is the divergence between the of the price and the peaks of a momentum indicator in this case the macd the two sloping red lines show that the price made in april and august 2016 whilst the momentum indicator made at these peaks in the price as the lines are sloping in different directions it is demonstrating negative divergence which means that the momentum of the uptrend is slowing down and can act as an early warning system to be more cautious in the near future so the question you could be asking is when is a good time to sell out of hd or at least some of your hd to rebalance why sell something that is still increasing in price only sell if you can determine that the price will not be increasing anymore in the near to medium term

as someone who 's currently shopping for some winter wheels and has the raised blood pressure to go with that i 've got a few suggestions as to what would make me pick up the phone and call your or email you if you 're advertising a vehicle keep in mind that if you 're willing to deal with the additional hassle you 'll normally get the most money for a used car if you sell it privately if it is worth the additional effort though is both a matter of judgement and if you 're willing to put up with strange people like me depending on the value of the vehicle and its rarity desirability you 're looking at newspaper ads probably wo n't get you much of a response these days craigslist and similar and last but not least ebay if you 're trying to sell something that 's easy to find because there are five at every street corner think minivan skip ebay if it 's worth below i would n't bother with places where you have to pay to advertise which leaves cl for the cheap stuff that said i 'd still stick it on cl if it 's advertised in other places heck it 's free after all the figure out what sort of money you 're asking for check the resources like and have a look at your local cl for similar vehicles out here certain types of vehicles for example sell quickly and often above even a little market research will help you come up with a good price just do n't do things like asking a massively inflated price for a vehicle because you paid $ x five years ago all this shows that you have no idea what your vehicle is worth oh and i 'd always work out what the minimum i 'd take is leave yourself some haggle room but do n't the vehicle once you know where you advertise and for how much pull together the basic facts for your vehicles and the points that would make it stand out basic facts about the car should include engine size type of transmission if it 's awd where applicable mileage color i can see on the pictures but it 's nice to include that too if you have service records recently replaced a big ticket item think transmission or similar or had a very recent service especially a big one where you had a timing belt and changed mention it do n't say the vehicle has a new engine if that was put in 100k miles ago that 's nice to mention but it 's not new if nobody 's ever smoked in it mention it if it 's got other outstanding features super low mileage summer only use etc make sure to mention it that too next if it 's got any faults that you know of especially obvious ones disclose them people like me will most likely find the leaking shock and the rust holes in the floor anyway and it makes a much better impression if you do tell us about them beforehand trying to tell someone that your banana shaped car that looks like the blue man group used it for practise is actually pristine and accident free is n't going to go down very well next pull together the paperwork make sure you 've got the title if there is a lien on the title check with the lienholder before advertising the car so you know their procedure for releasing the title any maintenance records you have manuals receipts etc if the vehicle has a salvage title try to find out why and mention it in the ad i 've just had a comedian phone me while i was driving to see his vehicle and leave a message that he did n't have a title and did n't seem to be willing to bother to get one either obviously that put me in the right frame of mind given that it was a 200 mile round trip so do n't do it if you ca n't get a title the schmuck you sold it to will have even less of a chance of getting one and given that you are in california a lot of people including myself react really badly to three years worth of back registration missing expired registrations on something i 'd expect to test drive etc essentially anything that would stop a potential cash buyer to drive it away on the spot next clean the car you know the five years of accumulated mcd and inch thick layer of dirt i 'm only partially kidding i 've seem some pretty horrible stuff recently spend the two hours it takes to clean it or pay to have it or detailed clean shiny cars sell a lot better than a rolling recycling container oh and last make the effort take some decent photos the more the shot in daylight no a black car after sunset and if there is any damage an additional photo or two showing the damage would be nice stick the on or similar and put the links in your craigslist ad so you do n't restrict yourself to the photos that you normally get on there as to payment i 'd either take cash meet the buyer at his bank where he draws out a cashiers check in front of your eyes or well cash no deeds on bridges in brooklyn or anything else be prepared to take a deposit a lot of buyers are n't willing to wander around with ten large ones in the back pocket to go look at a car and spell out exactly how long the deposit is good for i also tend to make them non refundable buyer does n't pick up the car within the negotiated timeframe you keep the deposit as damages for not being able to sell it to another cash buyer check your dmv 's website as to what exactly you need to do once you sold the car here in nevada it 's the buyer 's problem on how to move it as you keep the plates but i know in california the regular plates not personal ones iirc stay with the vehicle and i think you need to inform the dmv that you sold the vehicle i 'd also keep a record of who i sold a vehicle to name address from his drivers license license number etc just in case they run a few red lights and accumulate a few worth of parking tickets

credit unions have long advocated their services based on the fact that they consider your character   unfortunately they are then at a loss to explain how they determine the value of your character other than to say that you 're buddies play pool together so they 'll give you a loan your credit history score is as accurate a representation of your character in business dealings as can be meaningfully quantified   it tracks your ability to effectively use and manage debt and your propensity to pay it back responsibly or default on obligations   while it is n't perfect it is certainly one of the best means currently available for determining someone 's trustworthiness when it comes to financial matters

i had a coworker whose stock picking skills were clearly in the 1 level i had a few hundred shares of bought at $ 10 when my coworker bought at $ 80 i quietly sold as it spiked to $ 100 it then crashed as did many high tech stocks and my friend sold his shares close to the $ 4 bottom advising that the company would go under so i backed up the truck at $ 5 which for me at the time meant 1000 shares this was one of nearly 50 trades i made over a good 10 year period he was loud enough to hear throughout the office and his trades whether buy or sell were 100 wrong   individual stocks are very tough as other posters have offered that combined with taking advice from those who probably had no business giving it   for the record i am semi retired not from stock picks but from budgeting 20 of income to savings and being indexed s&p with 90 of the funds   if there are options on your stock you might sell calls for a few years but that 's a long term prospect i 'd sell and take my losses lesson learned i hope

offers usually have an expiration deadline as long as the signed offer is returned by the seller to the potential buyer before the expiration it is a valid contract the fact that the seller countered and his counter offer was n't accepted is irrelevant the buyer can void the offer as long as it is not yet accepted by notifying the seller in writing that the offer is null and void i 'm not a lawyer you should ask your real estate attorney to be sure but that is my understanding of the contract law

there is a basic difference between saving for voluntary retirement i.e. choosing to do things other than work even though you could still work and the need to save for later in life in general regardless of how much you like your job a time will eventually come when you are no longer able to work and you will need an alternate source of income to live from at that point this is also the time when most people generally have the highest medical bills as well and may need other services such as long term nursing home care so even if you plan to work as long as possible a retirement fund is an excellent way to plan for these needs as it is tax advantaged and many companies offer matching contributions i would simply recommend that you see retirement accounts as a good way to accomplish your goals you do n't have to use them to create a typical retirement once you 've taken advantages of the match and tax subsidies you may also wish to consider saving for an annuity fees can be high so you will need to do your homework generally you want to wait and buy an immediate annuity but this is another way to turn savings into guaranteed income once you need to stop working best of luck

we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910 there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough and gold possession had to be outlawed well partially so no we were not on a gold standard   secondly when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth

modern portfolio theory has a strong theoretical background and its conclusions on the risk return trade off have a lot of good supporting evidence   however the conclusions it draws need to be used very carefully when thinking about retirement investing   if you were really just trying to just pick the one investment that you would guess would make you the most money in the future then yes given no other information the riskiest asset would be the best one    however for most people the goal retirement investing is to be as sure as possible to retire comfortably   if you were to just invest in a single very risky asset you may have the highest expected return but the risk involved would mean there might be a good chance you money may not be there when you need it instead a broad diversified basket of riskier and safer assets leaning more toward the riskier investments when younger and the safer assets when you get closer to retirement tends to be a better fit with most people 's retirement goals   this tends to give on average more return when you are young and can better deal with the risk but back the risk later in life when your investment portfolio is a majority of your wealth and you can least afford any major swings   this combines the lessons of mpt diversity risk return trade off in a clearer way with common goals of retirement caveat   your retirement goals and risk tolerance may be very different from other peoples   it is often good to talk to fee only financial planner

i agree with joetaxpayer 's answer   the question you should be asking is not how do i spend more but how do i become happier   from what you say it may be that you could increase your happiness simply by cutting back on these aggressive attempts to save a few bucks here and there at the same time if you do this on some level your personality is probably not the type that would allow to simply forget it   i think many frugal people are somewhat as you describe they do n't like wasting money   in such cases often what matters is not so much the actual saving money as the feeling of saving money   therefore i 'd suggest that you take a look at which of the money losing activities you mention are really worth it the easiest ones to drop would be things like the home improvement project which even you acknowledge does not save you money   if you like saving money give yourself a pat on the back when you hire the contractor   if you want run the numbers so you can prove to yourself how much money you are saving by not doing the work for some of the other things it may be that spending time to save a small amount can an everyday experience and make it more interesting   for instance comparing products to save a few bucks is not necessarily bad unless you actually do n't like doing it   if spending a few hours comparing two toaster on amazon or whatever makes you feel good go for it it 's no worse than spending a few hours watching tv   by acknowledging that you get something out of it the feeling of getting a bargain and that you can feel better about and also potentially get it out of your system so that you wo n't feel the need to do it for every little thing   we all have our little pet and it 's possible to acknowledge that they 're irrational while still accepting them as part of your personality and finding a way to satisfy them in a controlled manner that does n't stress you out too much

whenever you do paid work for a company you will need to fill out some sort of paperwork so that the company knows how to pay you and also how to report how much they paid you to the appropriate government agencies you should not think of this as a hurdle and you should n't worry that you have n't been employed for a long time the two most common ways a company pays an individual are via employee wages or independent contractor payments when you start a relationship with a company if you are going to become an employee then you will out a w4 form and at the end of the year you will receive a w2 form if you are an independent contractor which you would be considered in this case you will fill out form w9 and at the end of the year you will receive a 1099 this is completely normal and you have nothing to worry about all it means is that if you make more than a certain amount typically $ 600 in a year you will receive a 1099 in the mail or electronically the 1099 form basically means that they are reporting that amount to the irs and it also helps you file your tax return by showing you all the numbers you need on one form please remember that when you are paid as an independent contractor no taxes are withheld on your behalf so you may owe some tax on the money you make it 's best to set aside some of your income so you are prepared to pay it come tax time next year

so one approach would be purely mathematical look at whichever has the higher interest rate and pay it first another approach is to ignore the math since the interest savings difference between a mortgage and student loan is likely small anyways and think about what your goals are   do you like having a student loan payment   would you prefer to get rid of it as quickly as possible   how would it feel to cut the balance in half in one shot if it were me i would pay the student loan as fast as possible student loans are not or and once you get it paid off you can put that payment amount toward your house to get it paid off

if i understand you correctly your logic goes wrong right at the beginning it sounds like you think one could avoid the income tax that would otherwise be owed to the us because of earning the money that was sent as a gift that 's not normally true from the irs 's gift tax faq may i deduct gifts on my income tax return making a gift or leaving your estate to your heirs does not ordinarily affect your federal income tax you can not deduct the value of gifts you make other than gifts that are deductible charitable contributions so the person who sends $ 10k to their parents does n't pay any less income tax than if they had kept the $ 10k in the us or had just send the $ 10k overseas directly to their own bank account gifting and re gifting did n't accomplish anything from the point of view of irs taxes you may have been confused by the annual exclusion that 's mentioned on that same page this exclusion is an exclusion for the gift tax this is a separate tax on gifts usually paid by the person who gives the gift if it were n't for the exclusion one would pay taxes twice on the money sent to their parents first when the money is earned and then again when the gift is given the exclusion helps avoid this second tax

you might want to to a little research they used to be fully self sufficient before in congress decided that they wanted to break the post office to destroy the postal union and i 'm guessing also open up opportunities for campaign contributing private firms       so they find ways to legislate crazy mandates that make the post office not profitable i guess it was bad pr for them when they say government ca n't do anything right to have people point to a post office that worked well and say what about that

nope   credit unions are for the customers   since the customers own them the credit union does what is best for the members   they are n't giving you money they are loaning it to you for for interest   furthermore then judged you like any other bank would high horse moment i believe the only reason you have to open an account is because the banking industry did n't want to compete and got legislation to limit the size and reach of a credit union    the credit union wants your business and they want to work for you but they are required to have these membership requirements because their lobby is n't as powerful as regular banks

your withholding is taken out of your pay so if you do you count the withholding twice that 's why it does n't add up for you the simple answer is to check your written contract offer letter see if it matches what you see or what you expected to see if the offer contract states $ 36 k check with the payroll person at work why the discrepancy if you do n't have any written proof of the agreed amounts do n't know if it is legal check local laws on the requirements of documenting employment terms then it is up to you and your employer to sort it out however keep in mind if you do n't have any written proof and the employer is unwilling to adjust one judge would wonder you 've been getting paychecks monthly which clearly state that your annual salary is $ why did you wait so long to sort this out

it depends on the area you want to focus in   to be sure i will say that pretty much all certificates in finance can be achieved online now   cfp is a pretty ok one i have it myself there is quite a bit of material but is n't too challenging it focuses on financial planning personal finance certainly aids your technical knowledge but is kind of an analog to help boost your sales most pure planners i know have this but moreover a series of more technical designations you must have a bachelors to be given the right to use the cfp   cfa is a great one for your resume and knowledge but makes the cfp look like a summer vacation it is for analysis but has a broad range of potential uses i know brokers advisors planners and people leaders with these marks if you are very smart it will take you a minimum of 2.5 years really to complete due to their testing schedule they also grade on a very steep curve from what i understand the amount of information and level of command you must demonstrate also necessitate this lengthy schedule   beyond that you can look at getting finra licensed in a desired area e.g. series to be a broker i would caution against this unless you are very sure of where you want to go or need to meet the requirement for a job typically jobs with license requirements will permit you 3 6 months to obtain them on company money you risk spending a good bit of money that wo n't be reimbursed by getting licensed independently keep in mind that you can not actually use your licenses without a firm sponsor   finally there are a variety of specialized designations like and that i would also caution against unless sure of desired position or meeting job requirements it is better in my opinion to find yourself in a place where getting these will better position you for your current job rather than wasting time on them and finding yourself in a place where they hold no water

there 's a huge difference between can an person make a profit on the stock market and can an average person get rich off the stock market it is certainly possible for an average person to profit but of course you are unlikely to profit as much as the big wall street guys   an s&p 500 index fund for instance would be a pretty good way to profit   people with high powered tools may make a lot of money picking individual stocks and may even make some choices that help them when the market is down but it 's difficult to see how they could consistently make money over the long term without the s&p 500 also going up   the same applies to varying to various other index funds etfs and mutual funds i agree with littleadv that there is no single right thing for everyone to do   my personal take is that index funds are a good bet and i 've seen a lot of people take that view on personal finance blogs etc for whatever that 's worth   one advantage of index funds that track major indexes like the s&p 500 is that because they are and are perceived as macro indicators of the overall economic situation at least you 're in the same boat as many other people   on one level that means that if you lose money a lot of other investors are also losing money and when large numbers of people start losing money that makes governments take action etc to turn things around   on another level the s&p 500 is a lot of big companies if it goes down some of those big companies are losing value and they will use their big company resources to gain value and if they succeed the index goes up again and you benefit in other words index funds and large mutual funds etfs etc make investing less about what day trading focus on which is trying to make a hot choice for a large gain   they make it more about your wagon to an extremely large star that is powered by all the resources of extremely large companies so that when those companies increase their value you gain   the bigger the pool of people whose fortunes rise and fall with your own the more you become part of an investment portfolio that is i ca n't resist saying it too big to fail   that is n't to say that the s&p 500 ca n't lose value from time to time but rather that if it does go down big and hard and stay there you probably have bigger problems than losing money in the stock market e.g. the us economy is collapsing and you should begin stockpiling bullets and canned food

there is no right and wrong answer to this question what you and your business partner perceive as fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture   first regarding the two issues you have raised capital contributions the fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity in my opinion what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company the securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable for example you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20 50 or 200   annual interest   salary it is common that co founders of start ups forgo their wages at the start of the company i do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid i suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution also consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner whose idea was it talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept in general execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good full time vs. part time a person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a part time helper control it is important to talk about control and decision making of the company you can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership you can also check the following article about this topic at

i would go speak to the bank manager with wells you have to make sure it is the bank manager and not a service manager or something you are talking to i learned that a few months ago   tell her him exactly what happened in detail and that you want the credit card closed and the credit inquiry removed from your credit report further say that once all of that is done you will decide whether to continue banking with them and whether any legal action is appropriate   if they give you any kind of push back i 'd get advice from a lawyer the truth is they did open an account against your expressed wishes and it required them to check your credit so it does constitute fraud unless they can produce a signed document saying you agreed to the card   edit i just saw that this happened about a year ago it may have been easier if you had done something at the time and may be more difficult if you 've used the card in the meantime

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

overall since gold has value in any currency and is sort of the ultimate reserve currency why would anyone want to currency hedge it because gold is mostly priced in usd you currency hedge it to avoid currency risk and be exposed to only the price risk of gold in usd   hedging it does n't mean less speculative it just means you wo n't take currency risk edit responding to op 's questions in comment what happens if the usd drops in value versus other major currencies do you think that the gold price in usd would not be affected by this drop in dollar value use the etf $ gld as a proxy of gold price in usd the correlation between weekly returns of $ gld and us dollar index measured by major world currencies since the etf 's inception is around what this says is that gold may or may not be affected by usd movement it 's certainly not a one way movement there are times where both usd and gold rise and fall simultaneously is n't a drop in dollar value fundamentally currency risk per investopedia currency risk arises from the change in price of one currency in relation to another in this context it 's referring to the eur usd movement the bottom line is that if gold price in dollar goes up 2 this etf gives the european investor a way to bring home that 2 or as close to that as possible

as described by the other answers there are pretty harmless explanations for that behaviour you could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments but that 's neither here nor there maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount on either sale you ca n't ever know the actual price you pay in the end is what counts what i would do if i expect in advance or if i notice during the negotiation that i am put under pressure in this way i usually try to do exactly the same in reverse that is i take   a minute to explain up front that i will not under any circumstance buy right now but that this is a purely informational event i will make sure not to have my money card with me any high end salesman worth his sale should have no problem with that at all money aside you are shopping for something that will mean a lot to you the salesman is not some of arbitrary wares everybody understands that not only do you not want to pay too high a price but also that you want to really get the item you want and want to be happy with it for a long time this is a tough decision often and if the salesman can not or does not want to respect that then it would be a clear signal for me that dubious things are going on in fact you would probably be if you got the wrong item for a great price than if you got a great item for a slightly too high price that is something you should probably not tell the salesman but can keep in mind so getting the greatest deal of all times is probably not so high on your priority list

from a federal tax point of view withdrawals from 529 plans are treated as taxable unless they are used on qualified expenses the part of a distribution representing the amount paid or contributed    to a qtp does not have to be included in income this is a return of    the investment in the plan the designated beneficiary generally does not have to include in    income any earnings distributed from a qtp if the total distribution    is less than or equal to adjusted qualified education expenses    defined under figuring the taxable portion of a distribution    later to determine if total distributions for the year are more or less than    the amount of qualified education expenses you must compare the total    of all qtp distributions for the tax year to the adjusted qualified    education expenses you 'll have to include them in your income and pay normal income tax on them and also in most cases pay an extra 10 penalty generally if you receive a taxable distribution you also must pay a    10 additional tax on the amount included in income you 'd have to check on the situation from a state perspective but i 'd imagine it 's quite similar the basic point is that non qualified distributions are treated as earnings

the implied intent is that balance transfers are for your balances not someone else 's   however i bet it would be not only allowed but also encouraged   why   because the goal of a teaser rate is to get you to borrow typically there is a balance transfer fee that allows the offering company to break even   in the unlikely event that a person does pay off the balance in the specified time frame the account and is then closed then nothing really lost its hard to find past articles i 've read as all the search engines are trying to get me to enroll in a balance transfer   however about 75 of 0 balance result in converting to a interest being accrued   if you are familiar with the amount of household credit card debt we carry as a nation that figure is very believable to answer your question i would assume they would allow it   however i would call and check and get their answer in writing   why   because if they change their mind or the representative tells you incorrectly and they find out they will convert your 0 credit card to an 18 or higher interest rate for violating the terms   same as if a payment was missed from the credit card company 's perspective they would be really smart to allow you to do this   the likelihood that your family member will pay the bill beyond two months is close to zero   the likelihood that a payment will be missed or late allowing them to convert to a higher rate is very high   this then might lead to you being overextended which would mean just more interest rates and fees   credit card company wins   i would not be surprised if they beg you to follow through on your plan from your perspective it would be a really dumb idea but as you said you knew that faced with the same situation i would just pay off one or more of the debts for the family member if i thought it would actually help them   i would also require them to have some financial accountability    its funny that once you require financial accountability for handouts most of those seeking a donation go elsewhere

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

as you have n't specified country will try and answer more in general whole life insurance but it seems to be the first thing any financial adviser is trained to sell the commission structure is such that it makes more attractive for a financial adviser to sell whole life plus for most buyers its easier to sell whole life compared to term the way guarantees are worded differ from policy to policy most of them do not give any guarantee its the adviser where there is guarantee it would be similar to a interest on bank deposit debt fund plus there are various terms used in the policy the guarantee may not be on sum assured but on the policy value that would be low in essence you are right on investing the difference into any save instruments like bank deposits certain debit funds government bonds retirement funds etc that would essentially give you more returns than what s promised in the whole life policy

there is no difference in safety form the perspective of the bank failing due to fdic ncua insurance   however there is a practical issue that should be considered if you allow payments to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account   in the case of an error all of you money may be unavailable until the error is resolved which could be days or weeks   by having two accounts this possibility may be reduced   it is n't a difference between checking and savings but a benefit of having two accounts note that if both accounts are at the same bank hey make take money from other accounts to cover the shortfall that said i 've done this for years and have never had a problem   also i have two accounts one at a local credit union with just enough kept in it to cover any payments and another online account that has the rest of my savings   i can easily transfer funds between the two accounts in a couple days

it will depend somewhat on the rules where the company is formed and perhaps how much you 're talking about investing i do n't know about canada but when i 've formed businesses in the u.s. i 've been advised to invest some of the money as an equity investment and the bulk of the remainder as a loan you say more shares so it sounds like you 've already invested some money and need to inject another round if you make a loan to the company make sure everything is done at arm 's length you 'll need to wear the hat of the company management and sign a contract with yourself use a market based interest rate and make sure the company is paying you back with interest an alternative which may work if you expect cash flow soon is to pay for certain expenses personally and then submit an expense report to the company which will pay you back overall a quick consultation with your accountant should be a relatively inexpensive way to get the best answer for your specific circumstances

yes management fees cut directly into your profits a fund which achieves 8 growth but costs 1 to maintain delivers only 7 to you compounded over years even a relatively small difference can add up to a significant amount of money this is one of the advantages index funds have they may not be as sophisticated as human managed funds but their expense ratio is so much lower that the end result for the investor is often as good as or better than the more expensive products in fact at least one study found that for each category they researched low expense ratio was a better predictor of good return on investment than anything else they looked at that does n't mean cheapest is always best or most expensive is always worst but it does mean you should be very very sure an expensive fund really is that much better before choosing it and sticking with simple index funds may be a perfectly reasonable choice

hi i 'm not sure what you 're looking for but i 'll assume you are just looking for some distinguishing characteristics of an infra deal   infra deals are typically   project financed meaning that a special purpose company spc is established to build and operate the asset project finance means that the spc is from any party and is backed by the cashflows of the project and not by the balance sheet of some parent entity   the spc 's cashflows are backed by a lengthy concession agreement e.g. a government body provides a concession to a private party to operate the infrastructure asset for say 30 years the concession agreement can best be thought of as a form of guarantee provided by the government body the exact terms of the agreement will vary but something like you can operate this toll road for 30 years and charge $ x per vehicle indexed at y% p.a should give you the idea of what a concession agreement is    because the concession agreement acts a bit like a guarantee over the cashflows of the spc it makes longer term and higher leveraged financing more plausible imagine a national asset where the aaa credit rated government body guaranteed 20 m cars a year for 30 years with a $ 5 toll charge your spc now has $ 100 m of cashflow every year for 30 years which is aaa credit rated this should enable you to get competitively priced long term capital and to gear the spc at much higher rates than non infra deals   at the end of the concession period the spc hands the asset back to the government completely debt free   so in a nutshell a government body grants a concession to a spc that guarantees its cashflows over a long term the spc is then financed based purely on this guarantee the spc then builds the asset operates it and then at the end of the concession period transfers it back to the government google build operate transfer or bot for more detail if curious     there are plenty of other distinguishing characteristics and a truck load of detail that i have completely skipped ignored so others may want to jump in ridicule me   good luck with your interview   edit formatting

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

it does n't sound fishy at all to me just seems like you may be dealing with a company that has relatively light trading volume to begin with meaning that small trades could easily make the price drop 8 which is n't much if you 're talking about a stocks in the $ 5 or less range if someone sells at the bid and the bid happens to be 8 lower than the current price that bid is now the price hence the drop the bid moving up afterward just means that someone is now willing to place a higher order than what the last trade was to try to get in

it depends greatly from place to place but nothing beats the internet reviews research if you ca n't find anything digging slightly deeper than the impressive home page then you probably should be worried as it seems that you are specifically i do these @johnfx mentions a valid point check for physical presence check that the office address is a real office and not a po box or residential call the number and see who answers it if you call several times during different hours and the same person answers that 's probably a one man operation but that does n't always help because short term renting an office is not all that hard and getting a call centre outsourced to a third world country does n't cost all that much it definitely helps if you 're dealing with someone local but if you 're in sweden and checking out a suspicious operation in cyprus this is definitely not enough

you might check out thrive they 're almost a carbon copy of mint from the last i checked but with some additional and i think more useful metrics for instance they seemed to help more to plan for future expenses in addition to keeping tabs on individual budgets the way mint does everything is automated in the same way as mint though i 'm not sure their breadth is as far reaching now since mint was bought out by intuit nevertheless whenever i 've had a question on thrive i shoot it to the devs and i get a very personal and courteous response within the day so it depends on what you 're looking for mint can almost guarantee any us bank will be accessible through their site however thrive will work much harder to gain your favor

because how you look at a billion or millions is important compared to how he looks at it   the bottom line is incentive to continue if he looks at how things used to be and how they are now and decides it 's not worth it it is his to close or sell the company    hopefully he sells to a chinese company who will low ball profits down to 100 million net profit and cuts employee benefits would n't that be a great success story of government incentivized capitalism   america

amazon just delayed my entrance into e books for a few years first off the prices are still crazy and secondly now you do nt even own the shit you pay the same price as a for   they are managing to remove all of the benefits of going digital i think they may be screwing themselves long term with these moves publishers with integrity are going to start going around them distributing e books is very easy

layman with a question the financial world is commonly depicted and regarded as being hard driving high pressure with very challenging work and absolutely life consuming irl i 've ever heard a few stories second hand about things like fairly regular 18 hour work days and such finance is certainly a broad field with many facets but generally how true is this i have to assume it at the least does n't quite meet popular perception because people would have nervous breakdowns

remember this when you rent you may get 1,600 back however you have to provide insurance on the house still 10 of that rent goes into a repair fund for things that break you do n't get compensated for months without a renter you still pay property tax and income tax if you have someone manage the house you have to pay their fee usually lots of variables when renting i looked into doing the same thing

the 2 and 20 rule is a premium arrangement that hedge funds offer and venture capital funds offer and they also offer different variations of it the 2 is the management fee as percent of assets under management the 20 is the profit cut which they only get if they are profitable there are and many variations you 're assuming that nobody offers this arrangement because it is n't offered to you but that 's because nobody offers it to people that are n't wealthy enough to legally qualify for their fund when you park 6 or 7 figure amounts in bank accounts they 'll send your information out to the funds that operate the way you wish they operated

negotiating a deal can be as easy as purchasing a or sometimes turn as complicated as purchasing a new plot it is much simpler if you are dealing with a single owner who is quite flexible or some large sized corporation that has zero negotiation policy

i started my account with $ 500 so i know where you 're coming from   for the words of caution in about 2009 we entered a pretty significant bull market   during this period you could basically buy almost any big name company and do pretty well for yourself   so do n't be too about your ability to pick winners in the middle of a bull market   over the last few years you 'd have to try pretty hard to consistently pick losers i absolutely think you should put real money in the game when you have this sort of interest   however at your $ 400 600 level broker fees will eat any sort of active trading or short term profit you could muster   stock trading is not a great way to make money in the short term   if you 're looking to save for something specific you should put that money in a zero risk savings account    you should do more research on brokers   find the lowest possible trade commission at an organization where you can meet the account opening minimum   a $ 10 commission is 11 more than a $ 9 commission

all of our paper ways are safe if they go away this society has much bigger problems than what your retirement account is worth i more or less understand the idea of being backed by the full faith of the government to mean that the government will be around for my entire lifetime    it is my opinion that everybody who suggests we invest in gold whiskey nickels or to a lesser extent real estate because the value of money is going to go away are interested in survival in a mad mad apocalyptic world   i very much doubt we get there and if we did everybody who planned for it wasted their time therefore invest in the traditional methods that are frequently discussed here   then invest in our society then make sure you vote from a learned position to keep our society on track with sensible leaders who are above
