why it is good to be risky the reason why it is good to be risky is because risky investments can result in higher returns on your money the problem with being risky is there is a chance you can lose money however in the long term you can usually benefit from higher returns even if you have a few slip ups let me show you an example   these two lines are based off of placing $ 2,000 in a retirement fund at age of 20 and then at age of 25 start investing $ 6,500 a year based off of a salary of $ 65,000 with a company that will 1 to 1 match up to 5 ira contribution presumably someone with a master 's should be able to get this and then being able to increase your contribution amount by $ 150 a year as your salary begins to increase as well the blue line assumes that all of this money that you are putting in a retirement account has a fixed 3 interest compounded yearly for simplicity sake every year until you retire the red line is earning a 12 interest rate while you are 20 years old and then decreasing by 0.5 per year until you retire since this is using more risky investments when you are younger i have even gone ahead and included losing 20 of your money when you are 24 another 20 when you are 29 and then again another 20 when you are 34 as you can see even with losing 20 of your money 3 different times you still end up with more money then you would have had if you stuck with a more conservative investment plan if i change this to 50 each 3 times you will still come out about equal to a more conservative investment now i do have these 3 loses placed at a younger age when there is less to lose but this is to be expected since you are being more risky when you are young when you are closer to retirement you have less of a chance of losing money since you will be investing more conservatively why it is ok to be risky when you are young but not old lets say you loose 20 of your $ 2,000 when you are young you have 30 40 years to make that back that 's roughly $ 1 a month extra that you are having to come up with so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are young you have plenty of time to account for it before you retire   now lets say you have $ 1,000,000 when you are 5 years from retiring and loose 20 of it you have to come up with an extra $ a month if you want to retire on time so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are close to retiring you will most likely have to work for many more years just to be able to recover from your loses what to invest in this is a little bit more difficult question to answer if there was one right way to invest your money every one would be doing that one right way and would result in it not turning out to be that good of investment what you need to do is come up with a plan for yourself my biggest advice that i can give is to be careful with fees some places will charge a fixed dollar amount per trade while others might charge a fixed dollar amount per month while even others might charge a percentage of your investment with only having $ 2,000 to invest a large fee might make it difficult to make money

those who say a person should invest in riskier assets when young are those who equate higher returns with higher risk i would argue that any investment you do not understand is risky and allows you to lose money at a more rapid rate than someone who understands the investment the way to reduce risk is to learn about what you want to invest in before you invest in it learning afterward can be a very expensive proposition possibly costing you your retirement warren buffet told the story on bloomberg radio in late 2013 of how he read everything in his local library on investing as a teenager and when his family moved to washington he realized he had the entire library of congress at his disposal one of mr. buffett 's famous quotes when asked why he does n't invest in the tech sector was i do n't invest in what i do not understand there are several major asset classes paper stocks bonds mutual funds currency commodities silver gold oil businesses creation purchase or partnership as opposed to common stock ownership and real estate rental properties flips land development pick one that interests you and learn everything about it that you can before investing this will allow you to minimize and mitigate risks while increasing the rewards

first of all going risky does n't mean driving to las vegas and playing roulette the real meaning is that you can afford higher risk return ratio compared to a person who will retire in the following ten years higher return is very important since time works for you and even several extra percent annually will make a big difference in the long run because of compound interest effect the key is that this requires the investment to not be too risky if you invest in a single venture and it fails you lose all the money and that 's worse that some conservative investment that could yield minimum income so you still need the investment to be relatively safe next as user chris w. rea mentions in the comment funds and etfs can be very risky depending on the investment policy they can invest into some very risky ventures or into some specific industry and that poses more risk that investing into blue chips for example so a fund or an etf can be a good fit for you if you choose a right one

as you say life insurance is about covering the loss of income so unless your child is an actor or musical or similar and already earning money there is no income to cover and in fact you would have less of a financial commitment without a child to provide for the other angle is that child life insurance is cheap and they 'll have lower premiums than an adult i 'll quote the referenced article directly to address that another ploy is that children 's life insurance is cheap it is inexpensive compared to adult life insurance because plain and simply children rarely die while the numbers that the sales agent puts together may make children 's life insurance sound like a great deal take the time to run what you 'd have if you instead invested the exact same amount used on the insurance fees into a roth ira and you 'll find the true cost of purchasing this type of life insurance

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

simply if your stock is still rising in price keep it if it is falling in price sell it and pay off your mortgage to know when to do this is very easy if it is currently rising you can put a trailing stop loss on it and sell it when it drops and hits your stop loss a second easy method is to draw an uptrend line under the increasing price and then sell when the price drops down below the uptrend line as per the chart below   this will enable you to capture the bulk of the price movement upward and sell before the price drops too far down you can then use the profits after tax to pay down your mortgage of course if the price is currently in a downtrend sell it asap

in australia we have a 50 capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months whether it is in shares property or other assets the main reason is to encourage people to invest long term instead of speculating or trading the government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor so rewards people it sees taking the lower risk long term view in my opinion long term investing short term trading and speculation can all be risky for someone who is in the financial markets and the first rule of investing should be to consider the asset itself and not the tax implications

i would just buy one etf index fund on the market you think will perform better it will take care to buy the 5 most solid stock in this market and many other more to reduce the risk to the bear minimum you will also spend only few bucks in definitely less than what you would spend buying multiple stocks even just 5 it 's hard enough to forecast which market will perform better it 's even harder to do stock picking unless you have the time and the knowledge to read into companies balance sheets economic incomes budgets market etc and even if you are great in reading into companies balance sheets economic incomes budgets the stock market usually behaves like a cows drove therefor even if you the most valuable solid stocks be prepared to see them run down even a 50 when all the market runs down a 50 during the 2008 crisis the europe market has lost a 70 and even the most solid sectors stocks like healthcare and food beverage lost a painful 40 to 50 true that now these sectors recovered greatly compared to the rest of the market but they still run down like cows during the crisis and if you them you would have suffered a huge pain stress but obviously there 's always some wizard which will later tell you he was able to select the only 5 stocks among thousands that performed well

it 's best to roll over a pension plan you do n't want to pay the penalties especially when you are young rolling over into another scheme or rolling over into a scheme that is somewhat self directed would avoid the penalty and could help you achieve higher returns should you feel you will perform better making regular monthly or biweekly contributions is imperative so that you catch compounded returns on your investments since you state that you are inexperienced i would suggest rolling over into the new scheme and sitting with the pension advisor for the company ie etc telling them some key information like your age in how many years you expect to retire your current income your desired pension income per year and such will greatly help them ensure that you come as close to your goal as possible providing nothing horrendous happens in the market

why do people keep talking about 401 k 's at work   that is not dollar cost averaging   dca refers to when you have a large sum of money   do you invest it all at once or spread it out over several smaller purchases over a period of time   there really is n't a when should i use it   it is simply a matter of where your preferences lie on the risk reward   dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing   in my opinion i do n't like it   dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops   but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000   do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a tradeoff   but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

even where national law might allow such a practice the law in an individual province or state either for issuing or receiving bank might not or if that does then the receiving bank may have its own regulations or compliance practice which may not permit them to accept an altered cheque   in any case printed numbers are usually machine readable and a corrected cheque would not be   the question needs a specific answer which addresses the specific circumstances involved which are not stated at the time of writing this but for the general question should i alter a printed cheque the answer must be no cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque in many cases there is no verification of and it would be perfectly acceptable simply to use cheques with duplicate numbers a cheque is merely an order to the bank to make a payment but you would not be able to identify a particular payment on your statement and neither would the issuing bank if you wanted one stopped where the number is verified as unique then clearing the payment may be refused or at best delayed in order to be making an obvious amendment to a cheque ’s details is likely to raise a red flag the receiving bank would not be able to tell if you did it or the payee they would not know why they may suspect that it was done in order to render the cheque even though the opposite is in fact the case and refuse to accept it they may refuse to accept it because it could not be read automatically any refusal would sour your relationship with your payees presumably your printing house or your bank if they printed them has made the error raise it with them and have them the batch ask your bank what to do with the incorrect cheques they may want them returned to the bank or they may be happy for you to keep and even use them if the latter i suggest you shred them

since you are considering dumping your savings into your student loans when they are equal you should go ahead and do it now   you will immediately reap the benefit of paying less interest per month   also your minimum monthly payments will decrease so if you had unexpected expenses pop up you could shrink your payments for a limited time   if you do n't have emergency expenses more of your regular monthly payment will go toward the principle of your loan and pay it off faster make a goal to get your savings back up as soon as you can after your loans are paid off   in the mean time see what other things you can cut back on like eating less expensive food or switching to a less expensive phone plan   if you have stuff you do n't need anymore try selling it on or ebay   or just focus on doing more at work so you can get a raise   these things are not necessary but it 's a good feeling to be able to shave another month or two off paying a debt

from your original reply to me   typical redditor who does n't even know the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank   i 'm the typical redditor who does n't know the difference between a depository bank and an investment bank so you dumb fuck tell me which one is citibank   also   gt;the ceo of a financial institution that was partly responsible for keeping the us economy from the shithole is a fucker   those ceos including this prick were responsible for it cdos and mortgage backed securities loaded with shit mortgages did n't just fucking emerge from thin air the big banks created them and loved them because they made billions in fees from them and they never stopped to evaluate either the individual risks of the products or the systemic risks in the system they did n't care because they knew the taxpayers would pick up the tab so pull your head out of your ass and yourself you moron   on the other hand why do n't you go the other way and completely fuck yourself since you ca n't even tell this typical redditor what type of bank citibank is you 're fucking worthless

grass is always greener at the other side of the hill   tax is only a small proportion of your costs you could easily set up a small company in a so called tax haven but are you willing to if not will the gain in less taxes cover the frequent travel costs even if you would like to less tax might be deceiving   i recently had a discussion with a us based friend in the us petrol is way cheaper then in europe there were many examples in differences but when you actually sum up everything cost of living was kind of the same so you might gain on tax but loose on petrol or child care to just name some examples   for big companies who think globally it makes sense to seek the cheapest tax formula for them it does not matter where they are located for us mortals it does

if this was going on in the uk i would try to get a mental capacity assessment done on the father there are laws that stop you taking advantage of people that do n’t understand what is going on these laws could be used against the manager but only if you can clearly prove that the father does not understand that the business is losing money if the father does understand what is going on then there is nothing you can do as he has every right to waste his money and anyone that may inherit what is left has no rights until he is dead

welcome to the what should otherwise be a simple choice turns into a huge analysis debate if the choice were actually simple we 've have one golden answer here and close others as duplicate but new questions continue to bring up different scenarios that impact the choice   4 years ago i wrote an article in which i discussed the density of your ira in that article i acknowledge that with no other tax favored savings you can pack more value into the roth   in hindsight i failed to add some key points first let 's go back to what i 'd describe as my main thesis a retired couple hits the top of the 15 bracket with an income of    $ i include just the standard deduction and exemptions the    tax on this gross sum is $ for an average rate of the tax paid or avoided upon deposit is one 's marginal rate but    at retirement the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket i.e.    the std deduction and exemptions then 10 then 15 the above is the simplest snapshot i am retired and our return this year included sch a itemized deductions property tax interest insurance donations added up fast and from a gross income ira withdrawal well into the 25 bracket the effective average rate was reported as 7.3 if we had saved in roth accounts it would have been subject to 25   i 'd suggest that it 's this phenomenon the save at marginal 25 but withdraw at average effect that account for much of the resulting tax savings that the ira provides   the way you are asking this you 've been focusing on one aspect i believe the density issue that assumes the investor has no 401(k option if i were building a spreadsheet to address this i 'd be sure to consider the fact that in a taxable account long term gains are taxed at 15 for higher earners i take the liberty to ignore   that wealthier taxpayers will pay a maximum 20 tax on long term capital gains this higher rate applies when your adjusted gross income falls into the top 39.6 tax bracket and those in the 10 or 15 bracket pay 0 with median household income at $ 56 k in 2016 and the 15 bracket top at $ 76 k this suggests that most people gov data shows $ 75 k is percentile have an effective unlimited roth so long as they invest in a way that avoids short term gains they can rebalance often enough to realize lt gains and pay zero tax   it 's likely the $ earner does have access to a 401(k or other higher deposit account if they do n't i 'd still favor pretax iras with $ 11 k for the couple still 10 or so of their earnings it would be a shame to lose that zero bracket of that first $ 20 k withdrawal at retirement again working backwards the $ 78 k withdrawal would take nearly $ 2 m in pretax savings to generate all in today 's dollars

this answer will expand a bit on the theory a company as an entity represents a pile of value some of that is business value the revenue stream from their products and some of that is assets real estate manufacturing equipment a patent portfolio etc one of those assets is cash if you own a share in the company you own a share of all those assets including the cash in a theoretical sense it does n't really matter whether the company holds the cash instead of you if the company adds an extra $ 1 billion to its assets then people who buy and sell the company will think hey there 's an extra $ 1 billion of cash in that company i should be willing to pay $ 1 billion shares outstanding more per share to own it than i would otherwise granted you may ultimately want to turn your ownership into cash but you can do that by selling your shares to someone else from a practical standpoint though the company does n't benefit from holding that cash for a long time cash does n't do much except sit in bank accounts and earn small amounts of interest and if you wanted pathetic amounts of interests from your cash you would n't be owning shares in a company you 'd have it in a bank account yourself really the company should do something with their cash usually that means investing it in their own business to grow and expand that business or to enhance profitability sometimes they may also purchase other companies if they think they can turn a profit from the purchase sometimes there are n't a lot of good options for what to do with that money in that case the company should say i ca n't effectively use this money in a way which will grow my business you should go and invest it yourself in whatever sort of business you think makes sense that 's when they pay a dividend you 'll see that a lot of the really big global companies are the ones paying dividends places like coca cola or exxon mobil or what have you they just ca n't put all their cash to good use even after their growth plans many people who get dividends will invest them in the stock market again possibly purchasing shares of the same company from someone else or possibly purchasing shares of another company it does n't usually make a lot of sense for the company to invest in the stock market themselves though investment expertise is n't really something most companies are known for and because a company has multiple owners they may have differing investment needs and risk tolerance for instance if i had a bunch of money from the stock market i 'd put it in some sort of growth stock because i 'm twenty something with a lot of savings and years to go before retirement if i were close to retirement though i would want it in a more stable stock or even in bonds if i were retired i might even spend it directly so the company should let all its owners choose unless they have a good business reason not to sometimes companies will do share buy backs instead of dividends which pays money to people selling the company stock the remaining owners benefit by reducing the number of shares outstanding so they own more of what 's left they should only do this if they think the stock is at a fair price or below a fair price for the company otherwise the remaining owners are essentially giving away cash this actually happens often on the other hand if the company 's stock is depressed but it subsequently does better than the rest of the market then it is a very good investment the one nice thing about share buy backs in general is that they do n't have any immediate tax implications for the company 's owners they simply own a stock which is now more valuable and can sell it and pay taxes on that sale whenever they choose

probably the best way to investigate this is to look at an example first as the commenters above have already said the log return from one period is at time t price at time which is approximately equal to the percentage change in the price from time to time t provided that this percentage change is not big compared to the size of the price note that you have to use the natural log ie log to the base e button on a calculator here the main use of the log return is that is a proxy for the percentage change in the price which turns out to be mathematically convenient for various reasons which have mostly already been mentioned in the comments but you already know this your actual question is about the average log return over a period of time what does this indicate about the stock the answer is if the stock price is not changing very much then the average log return is about equal to the average percentage change in the price and is very easy and quick to calculate but if the stock price is very volatile then the average log return can be wildly different to the average percentage change in the price here is an example the closing prices for pitchfork oil from last week 's trading are 10 5 12 5 10 2 15 the percentage changes are 1.4 1 6.5 where means -50 etc the average percentage change is or on the other hand the log returns for the same period are 2 and the average log return is about if we used this as a proxy for the average percentage change in the price over the whole seven days we would get 6.8 instead of which is wildly wrong the reason why it is wrong is because the price fluctuated so much on the other hand the closing prices for united marshmallow over the same period are 10 11 12 11 12 13 15 the average percentage change from day to day is and the average log return is so in this case the log return is very close to the percentage change and it has the advantage of being from just the first and last prices because the properties of imply that it simplifies to notice that this is exactly the same as for pitchfork oil so one reason why you might be interested in the average log return is that it gives a very quick way to estimate the average return if the stock price is not changing very much another more subtle reason is that it actually behaves better than the percentage return when the price of pitchfork jumps from 5 to 12 and then crashes back to 5 again the percentage changes are + 140 and for an average of + 82 that sounds good but if you had bought it at 5 and then sold it at 5 you would actually have made 0 on your money the log returns for the same period do not have this disturbing property because they do add up to 0   what 's the real difference in this example well if you had bought $ 1 worth of pitchfork on tuesday when it was 5 and sold it on wednesday when it was 12 you would have made a profit of $ 1.40 if you had then bought another $ 1 on wednesday and sold it on thursday you would have made a loss of $ overall your profit would have been $ this is what the average percentage return is calculating on the other hand if you had been a long term investor who had bought on tuesday and hung on until thursday then quoting an average return of 82 is highly misleading because it in no way corresponds to the return of 0 which you actually got   the moral is that it may be better to look at the log returns if you are a buy and hold type of investor because log returns cancel out when prices fluctuate whereas percentage changes in price do not but the flip side of this is that your average log return over a period of time does not give you much information about what the prices have been doing since it is just price of periods since it is so easy to calculate from the initial and final prices themselves you commonly wo n't see it in the financial pages as far as i know   finally to answer your question does knowing this single piece of information indicate something about the stock i would say not really from the point of view of this one indicator pitchfork oil and united marshmallow look like identical investments when they are clearly not knowing the average log return is exactly the same as knowing the ratio between the final and initial prices

i am not going to discuss legality because with family members you are able to give a lot of guidance and assistance without running into legal issues   the biggest problem is that when they transfer the funds to you and you invest the money all the tax rates and tax limits are determined by your situation plus you have more investments than you should have so you hit those limits and brackets quicker for example in the united states a person can put $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 into a ira or roth ira each year if you combine the funds for three with your funds then you are giving up three quarters of the amount that you can invest in that type of account the decision regarding roth or not depends on age and income level but now their decision is related to what is best based on your situation the ability to even deduct ira deposits would be based on your situation of course for taxable accounts the tax rate is determined by your income not theirs if they want you to have the ability to make investment decisions for them then power of attorney is the way to go the money is deposited in their name and all the rules and tax rates are determined by their situation you make sure they have all the information they need to login and review the accounts but you make the all the moves within and between accounts

in the us dividends have special tax treatment similar to but not the same as capital gains no easy way to transform one to the other the very fact that you invested your money in a company that has returned part of your capital as income means it is just that income also in the us you could invest in master limited partnerships these are companies that make distributions that are treated as a return of capital instead of dividends throughout the life of the investment you receive tax forms that assign part of the operating expense loss of the company to you as a tax payer then at the end of the investment life you are required to recapture those losses as capital gains on sale of the stock in some ways these investments do exactly what you are asking about they transform periodic income into later capital gains basically deferring tax on the income until the sale of the security here is an article i found about mlps coming to the uk through an etf master limited partnerships in the uk

generally not however some brokers may allow it my previous cfd broker cmc markets used to allow you to adjust the leverage from the maximum allowed for that stock say 5 to 100 of your own money before you place a trade so obviously if you set it at 100 you pay no interest on holding open long positions overnight if you ca n't find a broker that allows this as i do n't think there would be too many around you can always trade within your account size for example if you have an account size of $ 20,000 then you only take out trades that have a face value up to the $ 20,000 when you become more experienced and confident you can increase this to 2 or 3 time your account size maybe if you are just starting out you should first open a virtual account to test your strategies out and get used to using leverage you should put together a trading plan with position sizing and risk management before starting real trading and you can test these in your virtual trading before putting real money on the table also if you want to avoid leverage when first starting out you could always start trading the underlying without any leverage but you should still have a trading plan in place first

a fund is generally speaking a collection of similar financial products which are bundled into a single investment so that you as an individual can buy a portion of the fund rather than buying 50 portions of various products e.g. a bond fund may be a collection of various corporate bonds that are bundled together the performance of the fund would be the aggregate of each individual item generally speaking funds are like pre packaged diversification rather than take time and fees to buy 50 different stocks on the same stock index you could buy an index fund which represents the values of all of those stocks a portfolio is your individual package of investments ie the 20k you have in bonds + the 5k you have in shares + the 50k you have in funds + the 100k rental property you own you might split the definition further buy saying my 401(k portfolio my taxable portfolio my real estate to denote how those items are invested the implication of portfolio is that you have considered how all of your investments work together ie your 5k in stocks is not so risky because it is only 5k out of your entire portfolio which includes some low risk bonds and funds another way of looking at it is that a fund is a special type of portfolio that is a fund is a portfolio that someone will sell to someone else see daniel 's answer below for example imagine you had $ 5,000 invested in ibm shares and also had $ 5,000 invested in apple shares call this your portfolio but you also want to sell your portfolio so let 's also call it a fund then you sell half of your fund to a friend so your friend let 's call him maurice pays you $ 4,000 to invest in your fund maurice gives you $ 4k and in return you given him a note that says maurice owns 40 of 's fund   the following month ibm pays you $ 100 in dividends but maurice owns 40 of those dividends so you give him a cheque for $ 40 some funds automatically reinvest dividends for their clients instead of paying them out immediately then you sell your apple shares for $ 6,000 a gain of $ 1,000 since you bought them but maurice owns 40 of that 6k so you give him $ 2,400 or perhaps instead of giving him the money immediately you reinvest it within the fund and buy $ 6k of microsoft shares why would you set up this fund because maurice will pay you a fee equal to let 's say 1 of his total investment your job is now to invest the money in the fund in a way that aligns with what you told maurice when he signed the contract ie maybe it 's a tech fund and you can only invest in big tech companies maybe it 's an index fund and your investment needs to exactly match a specific portion of the new york stock exchange maybe it 's a bond fund and you can only invest in corporate bonds so to reiterate a portfolio is a collection of investments think of an artist 's portfolio being a collection of their work usually people refer to their own portfolio of personal investments a fund is someone 's portfolio that other people can invest in this allows an individual investor to give some of their decision making over to a fund manager in addition to relying on expertise of others this allows the investor to save on transaction costs because they can have a well diversified portfolio see what i did there while only buying into one or a few funds

banks can not survive without the government   once people lose faith in the the banking system will fail   the banking system failing is a symptom of the issue not a cause   the banks protects the general populace and prevents runs which will actually destroy the banking system   the burden shifts from the banks to the government   but a is not an actual payment   the banks still operate as normal without any cash from the government but with the knowledge that if they are over extended the government will take on their debt   the government lowers the rates that the banks pay to raise debt to continue to operate   so let 's say piigs fully bail out their banking system paying off all debt that 's worse case   where does the money come from    revenues aka taxes   if the gov't takes on the bank debt and has revenue no problem a little less hand outs but the country as a whole benefits from having a functioning banking system   if revenues are poor or negative however it 's just adding to the deficit   gov't can print money do n't forget    but if revenues are poor and there 's no hope to see them improve boom all hell breaks loose and you get europe

i too am a full monthly statement balance payer and i received a balance transfer offer from my credit card company this one was quite different from many others that i have read about on this forum i could do a balance transfer for any amount up to $ x from another credit card or use the checks to pay   some other non credit card bills and i would not have to pay any interest for 12 months on the amount thus borrowed   but there would be a 2 service charge on the amount i was borrowing this amount would be billed on the next monthly statement and it would have to be paid in full by the due date of that month 's payment that is within the grace period allowed for payment of monthly statements else interest would start being charged on the unpaid part of the service charge at the usual rate of per month if i had not paid the previous month 's balance in full i would be charged interest at per month on the service charge starting from day one no free ride till the due date of the next month 's statement of course the balance carried over from last month would also be charged interest at if i had paid last month 's bill in full but there were any other charges purchases during the current month then   unless the entire amount due this month 's purchases plus service charge and that interest free for twelve months loan   balance was paid off within the grace period my purchases would be deemed unpaid and would start being charged interest in short the only way to avoid paying interest on the amount borrowed was to start with a card showing a $ 0 balance due on the previous month 's statement not make any charges on that card for a whole year and pay off that 2 service charge within the grace period it might also have required that one of that interest free loan be repaid each month but   i had stopped reading the offer at this point and filed it in the round circular file in short while @joetaxpayer 's tale of how as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage is undoubtedly how things worked once it is not at all clear that they still work that way at least they do n't work that way for me   heck once upon a time for a period of about 3 months you could earn 1.5 interest per month from the credit card company by overpaying your credit card bill considerably their computers then just added on 1.5 interest by multiplying your credit balance by and so you got 1.5 per month interest from the credit card company the credit card agreements and the software got changed in a hurry and all credit card agreements state in the fine print that if you overpay your bill you do n't earn any interest on the overpayment

couple of to start off index funds and etf 's are essentially the same investments   etf 's allow you to trade during the day but also make you reinvest your dividends manually instead of doing it for you   compare vti and vtsax for example   basically the same returns with very slight differences in how they are run   because they are so similar it does n't matter which you choose either index funds and etf 's can be purchased through a regular taxable brokerage account or through an ira or roth ira   the decision of what fund to use and whether to use a brokerage or ira are separate whole market index funds will get you exposure to us equity but consider also diversifying into international equity bonds real estate reits and emerging markets   any broker can give you advice on that score or you can get free advice from for example future advisor   now the advice for most people in your situation you current tax rate is currently very low   this makes a roth ira a very reasonable idea   you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2015 if you do it before april 15 and you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2016   repeat each year   you wo n't be able to get all your money into a roth but anything you can do now will save you money on taxes in the long run   you put after tax money in a roth ira and then you do n't pay taxes on it or the gains when you take it out you can use roth ira funds for college for a first home or for retirement a traditional ira is not recommended in your case   that would save you money on taxes this year when presumably your taxes are already low since you wo n't be able to put all your money in the ira you can put the rest in a regular taxable brokerage account if you do n't just want to put it in a savings account   you can buy the same types of things as you have in your ira    note that if your stocks in your regular brokerage account go up over the course of a year and your income is low enough to be in the 10 or 15 tax bracket and you have held the stock for at least a year you should sell before the end of the year to lock in your gains and pay taxes on them at the capital gains rate of 0 this will prevent you from paying a higher rate on those gains later   conversely if you lose money in a year do n't sell you can sell and lock in losses during years when your taxes are high presumably after college to reduce your tax burden in those years this is called tax loss harvesting sounds like crazy but the name of the game is legally avoiding taxes   this is at least as important to your overall wealth as the decision of which funds to buy ok now the financial advisor   it 's up to you   you can make your own financial decisions and save the money but it requires you putting in the effort to be educated   for many of us this education is fun   also consider that if you use a regular broker like fidelity you can call up and they have people who for free will give you advice very similar to what you will get from the advisor you referred to   high priced financial advisors make more sense when you have a lot of money and complicated finances   based on your question you do n't strike me as having those   to me 1 sounds like a lot to pay for a simple situation like yours

gt but we as a society do not even offer enough college courses to let people learn new skills   is this part of the problem we as a society seem to be fascinated by training i know of several people who are quite capable but feel inadequate in doing a job until what they are doing has been validated by someone else through formal training   i believe this is where 's coworker was coming from when the fit was r business comments learning a new skill in her coworker 's eyes means going back to a place of training and nobody wants to go back to college once they are in an established career not unless it is happening as part of the job on the company dime   a lot of these people grew up in a time where they were constantly reminded that college was the only way to find a job the idea that you can learn some real marketable skills over the weekend just by playing with a hobby project would never occur to these people because to them college = job

is this an unusual amount to pay for refinancing a home loan yes i would say it seems pretty high   although credit unions usually have pretty good deals i would shop around a bit is refinancing not worth it if you might move in the next year or two totally not worth it if you 'll be moving in a year or two   you need to think realistically about what you could sell your house for though   if you bought it 4 years ago it 's likely gone down in value significantly depending on your locale   are you prepared to take a significant loss to sell   if not you might be forced to stick it out for 3 5 years or more

my friend harry sit wrote an excellent article no tax advantage in rsu   the punchline is this the day the rsus vested it 's pretty much you got $ xxx in taxable income and then bought the stock at the price at that moment the clock for long term gain starts the same as if i bought the stock that day   historical side note in the insane days of the dotcom bubble people found they got rsus vested and worth say $ 1m. crash the shares are worth $ 100k. the $ 1 m was ordinary income the basis was $ 1 m and the $ 900 k loss could offset cap gains not ordinary income above $ let me be clear the tax bill was $ but the poor taxpayer had $ 100 k in stock to sell to pay that bill this is the origin of the sell the day it vests advice   the shares you own will be long term for capital gain a year after vesting after the year be sure to sell those particular shares and you 're all set no different than anyone selling the lt shares of stock when owning multiple lots but do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog if you feel it 's time to sell you can easily lose the tax savings while watching the stock fall waiting for the clock to tick to one year

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

gt;the odd thing about primary school education that i hear from talking to teachers is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide or even state wide in the case of texas decision for which program to use   it did n't used to be that way but yes that is pretty much how it is done these days basically central planning and one size fits all as i said   gt;for reading they generally include a set of books or single book with a sequence of things to be taught teacher 's who 've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material they might refer to them by names but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material    and of course none of that really has anything to do with actual reading   gt;when one teacher says to another i used $ x to supplement the required $ y it 'd be like a software engineer saying i used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case there 's a fair amount of baggage in the statement but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made   no that 's a rather poor analogy   a better analogy would be we used to use sap but then we got bought out by xyz corporation and now we have to build everything around oracle and the reality is that both choices are crap   gt;as to the master 's in reading there 's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the education departments at state schools a large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level they tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you 'd find in other subjects including mba take these classes part time and summers over the next 3 years and if you pass them all we give you a piece of paper that says masters of education reading or similar it comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something   it 's also a result of the requirement for continuing education to maintain teaching licenses certifications   and yeah it has created a lot of underwater basket weaving experts the problem is that they actually sincerely believe that they have some significant expertise even though it can not be shown in their results if it could they would be all about merit pay   gt;i actually doubt that it 's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching some work some do n't the structure of the system discourages unfortunately and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied   young beginning teachers feel they have their hands tied those types either leave teaching or they succumb to the system   the teacher in question with the masters in reading to the system long long ago   and that teacher 's whole concern was really just a brand x versus brand y thing the teacher knows brand x and so can and probably does teach it while half asleep   most long tenure teachers tend to get in a comfortable comfortable in no small because it is not only familiar but also because it then requires little work to update their or prepare anything new disrupting that i.e. switching from brand x to brand y is therefore nearly always met with either opposition or amp compliance   it is indeed the system but one must keep in mind that it is the teachers collectively in aggregate over time that have essentially created that system

this would be stupid and i wonder about the journalist who wrote that but google is hardly stupid   google does n't make money giving browsers away google makes money keeping you online as much as possible creating the biggest possible mess of online data private or public so that you need them to search through it in the process they get to know you best and display the most relevant ads for you   to keep you online google needs the online experience to be better than the desktop applications based experience they need to push web technologies progress forward as hard and fast as possible   to organize the web they need data to be fairly open and standard for instance facebook is completely closed and although it contains amazingly valuable information which google could turn into of advertising money they do n't make a dime because they ca n't read it   that 's why google subsidized firefox before getting a second life insurance with chrome if microsoft or apple or facebook ends up owning a browser with 90 market share they define de facto web standards and you can bet they 'll define them in a way which google google needs open browsers and it needs them to be good enough to keep a critical market share with this respect it does n't matter much whether it 's firefox or chrome it simply has to be neither ms nor apple 's nor fb 's   now chrome has a big advantage compared to firefox google decides exactly what goes in it it allows google to accelerate the adoption of new protocols such as or offline mode support by simply ordering its employees to put them in chrome it only works if chrome is good enough to maintain a critical market share of course and if a proposal is good enough and open sourced it will eventually end up in firefox which remember has nothing to refuse to google   so the only advantage google would get from killing the firefox deal is that they 'd save the $ what are the negative outcomes   they 'd lose the right to pretend they strive not to be evil among numerous impacts it 's not unlikely that geeks will boycott chrome in retaliation and there 's a risk that they find a smart way to seriously harm it   if they propose a new standard today they implement it in chrome if it 's picked up a year later by firefox that 's a momentum of adoption among leading web browsers if firefox dies and google puts an extension in chrome that 's just google putting a proprietary google extension into their google browser for their google websites nothing to write home about no momentum no adoption no risk that apple or ms will ever be pressured into supporting it in their browsers   i 'd bet they 'd rather go on paying than taking so much risks

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

for most banks this is not the case   transfers within the bank are usually instantaneous it is not uncommon for banks to draw out the length of transactions because while the money is transferring or settling it is actually sitting on the bank 's balance sheet being lent out but not earning any interest   a good deal for them when you aggregate over the millions of customers they have   your bank may be trying to squeeze a few pennies of interest out of you delays in transactions also allow their fraud team the flexibility to investigate transactions if they want to normally they probably do n't but if the bank delays all transactions then those being investigated will not be aware of it

two parties will agree to pay each other 's interest obligations this is generally for one of two reasons    one party wishes to swap a fixed interest rate eg coupons on a bond for a floating interest rate eg payments on a loan if their counterparty wishes the opposite and the rates are acceptable to both they will agree to swap their obligations   there are two firms based in countries a and b. each firm has a branch in the other 's country and these branches each have a loan denominated in that other countries currency to reduce each firm 's exposure to fx risk they can swap their obligations so a will pay interest on b 's loan which is in a 's currency and b on a 's loan which is in b 's currency   edit removed bracket

i 'm of your position    i reckon that people who put crazy long hours into a business that fails are lacking some intangible qualities of entrepreneurship   there are people you can just tell they do n't have what it takes they 're putting in loads of commitment or loads of money into an idea that just is n't right or they spend money in the wrong ways you know how all these internet companies spent money on champagne and $ 1000 chairs during the dot com bubble i 've seen the small scale version of that as people rent expensive offices when i 'm thinking why are n't you just working from home    as a small time entrepreneur i 'm obviously biased but if you 've got what it takes so i think there is an element of here and you work hard then you will succeed to some greater or lesser extent   i mean i know electricians and builders that have started their own contracting or supplies businesses they 're not rich by the standard of but they have a bloody nice house and a bloody nice car in the driveway and they probably take an afternoon a week off to play golf they 're doing better than most of the other guys they worked with as electricians or builders 20 years ago and i do n't see that they 're really doing anything too clever or sophisticated    also the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed failed here is a very dramatic word implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt often it 's not a case that the business lost them money they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing but more that it made a bit of money but not enough so they moved on to something else that something else might be regular employment for some people but there are plenty of entrepreneurs perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success

from getting rid of pmi per the federal homeowners protection act you can ask that your pmi be canceled when you 've paid down your mortgage to 80 of the loan if you have a good record of payment and compliance with the terms of your mortgage you make a written request and you show that the value of the property has n't gone down   what 's more when you 've paid down your mortgage to 78 of the original loan the law says that the lender must automatically cancel your pmi so in this case to prove it has n't gone down an appraisal is in order but all of this does n't answer the question the pmi is a separate line item once it 's removed your total monthly payment drops you are welcome to keep it in and indicate it should be a prepayment of principal if that 's your wish but that 's up to you it 's not automatic   in researching this the first time i ran into an article how to calculate pmi costs in which an example is given where a 91 ltv $ 200 k loan has a pmi cost of $ so the impact of not having that extra $ 20 k or so is to pay what amount to an extra 5 on the last $ 20 k of the loan the pmi does n't scale over time when you are $ 10 k away from 80 ltv you still pay the $ 1k yr for this reason if you absolutely must go over 80 ltv i 'd suggest shopping for a bank that will permit the excess to be a home equity loan   at least the payoff of that 2nd loan in totally in your control

p e alone would not work very well see for example and in short p e is affected too much by cyclical changes in profit margins or you might say booms inflate the e beyond sustainable levels thus making the p e look more favorable than it is here 's a random blog post that points to schiller 's normalized earnings measure i think even price to sales is supposed to work better than p e for predicting 10-year returns on a broad index because it effectively normalizes the margins normalized valuation explains the variance in 10-year returns better than the variance in 1-year returns i think i 've read you ca n't rely on things reverting to mean in only 1 year another issue with p e is that e is more subject to weird accounting effects than for example revenues for example whether stock compensation is expensed or one time write offs are included or whatever can mean you end up with an economically strange earnings number btw a simple way to do what you describe here would be to put a chunk of money into funds that vary equity exposure for example john hussman 's fund has an elaborate model that he uses to decide when to hedge say you invest 40 bonds 40 stocks and 20 in hussman strategic growth when hussman fully hedges his fund you would effectively have 40 in stocks and when he fully it you would have 60 in stocks this is n't quite the whole story he also tries to pick up some gains through stock picking so when fully hedged the fund is n't quite equivalent to cash more like a market neutral fund for hussman funds in particular he 's considered stocks to be overvalued for most of the last 15 years and the fund is almost always fully hedged so you 'd want to be comfortable with that there are other funds out there doing similar stuff there are certainly funds that vary equity exposure though most not as dramatically as the hussman fund some possibilities might be pimco all asset all authority pimco multi asset perhaps or just some value oriented funds with willingness to deviate from benchmarks definitely read the prospectus on all these and research other options i just thought it would be helpful to mention a couple of specific examples if you wanted to stick to managing etfs yourself morningstar 's premium service has an interesting feature where they take the by hand bottom up analysis of all the stocks in an etf and use that to calculate an or under valuation ratio for the etf i do n't know if the morningstar bottom up stuff necessarily works i 'm sure they make the pro case on their site on the con side in the financial crisis bubble bursting they cut their valuation on many companies and they had a high valuation on a lot of the financials that blew up while i have n't run any stats and do n't have the data in several specific cases it looked like their bottom up analysis ended up assuming too high profit margins would continue broad brush normalized valuation measures avoided that mistake by ignoring the details of all the individual companies and assuming the whole index had to revert to mean if you 're rich i think you can hire gmo to do a varied equity exposure strategy for you   you could also look at the fundamental indexing etfs that weight by dividends or p e or other measures of value rather than by market cap the bottom line is there are lots of ways to do tactical asset allocation it seems complex enough that i 'm not sure it 's something you 'd want to manage yourself there are also a lot of managers doing this that i personally am not comfortable with because they do n't seem to have a discipline or method that they explain well enough or they do n't seem to do enough backtesting and math or they rely on macroeconomic forecasts that probably are n't reliable or whatever all of these tactical allocation strategies are flavors of active management i 'm most comfortable with active management when it has a fairly objective and logical discipline to it such as style value investing hussman 's statistical methods or whatever it is   many people will argue that all active management is bad and there 's no way to distinguish among any of it i am not in that camp but i do think a lot of active managers are bad and that it 's pretty hard to distinguish among them and i think active management is more likely to help with risk control than it is to help with beating the market still you should know and probably already do know but i 'll note for other readers that there 's a strong argument smart people make that you 're best off avoiding this whole line of tactical allocation thinking and just sticking to the pure cap based index funds

i did read the article i 'm very surprised that such a simple and alternative idea was poorly received but i have a feeling it 's because you did n't read my response carefully enough the 3 5 years which you took to mean the training time was presented as the commitment in return for free training which i expected would take around 6 12 months the candidates suggested would already have master 's degrees in other fields and so it 's to be expected they 'll need around 30 60 hours to train them to an academic level full time this should only take a year    an h1-b visa takes around 6 months to process and when you factor in the amount of time it takes someone to actually move from a foreign country it can easily be faster to train than transport in any case you could do both while you transition to a training process   here 's an article on the processes that i am discussing where peter is interviewed by the wharton business school the gist of it is that because companies control every aspect of the hiring and job creation process it is a large part of the fault on their shoulders when they ca n't find the right person      thanks for playing

there is no right and wrong answer to this question what you and your business partner perceive as fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture   first regarding the two issues you have raised capital contributions the fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity in my opinion what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company the securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable for example you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20 50 or 200   annual interest   salary it is common that co founders of start ups forgo their wages at the start of the company i do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid i suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution also consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner whose idea was it talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept in general execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good full time vs. part time a person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a part time helper control it is important to talk about control and decision making of the company you can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership you can also check the following article about this topic at

first you are not exactly giving the brokerage $ 2000 that money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises if you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $ 6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $ 30/share sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account the way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines it is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse if you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower in your example you are selling 200 shares at $ 20 and later buying those at $ 19 thus your profit is $ 200 not counting any interest or fees you have paid it 's a bit confusing because you are selling something you 'll buy in the future selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially if i sell at $ 20/share the most i can make is if the stock declines to $ 0   your potential to lose is unlimited in theory there is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so i could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss   i used $ 20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order if you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway if someone says i would like to give you $ 20 for that item you are selling you are n't likely to tell them no i 'd really only like $ 19 for it

there are a few reasons dependent on the location of the company   the first as you mentioned is that it means that the employee is invested in the companies success in theory this should motivate the employee to work hard in order to increase the value of their holdings sometimes these have a period which requires that they hold the stock for a certain amount of time before they are able to sell and that they continue working at the company for a certain amount of time the second is that unlike cash providing stocks does n't come out of the companies liquid cash while it is still an expense and does devalue the shares of other shareholders it does n't effect the daily working capital which is important to maintain to ensure business continuity and the third and this is for the employee is tax reasons in particular for substantial amounts of course this is dependent on jurisdiction but you can often achieve lower tax rates on receiving shares vs a cash equivalent sum as you can draw out the money over time lowering your tax obligation each year or other methods which are n't possible to look into now hope this helps

you did n't identify the fund but here is the most obvious way some of the stocks they owned could had dividends therefore they would have had to pass them on to the investors if the fund sold shares of stocks they could have capital gains they would have sold stocks to pay investors who sold shares they also could have sold shares of stock to lock in gains or to get out of positions they no longer wanted   therefore a fund could have dividends and capital gains but not have an increase in value for the year some investors look at how tax efficient a fund is before investing

there really can not be a straightforward answer to this question it all depends on what lengths you take to make the situation advantageous   if you manage to have a constant flow of people living at the place during all of the times you are not living there and manage to find a cleaning service for a reasonable price then yes there is a chance that this could be advantageous for you   if you are simply looking for a way to offset some of the costs of the place you are n't living at full time then you need to draw a comparison between upkeep and how often you will actually have customers   it is likely you will have down time in which there will be no one staying at the house hiring a cleaning service will cut some of your profit and depending on how much that profit is it could be a pretty big cut now not being an expert on taxes i can not say how this will impact those but it is likely that you will have to pay taxes on money earned   all this in mind its a decision you will need to make taking all of the factors into consideration maybe give it a trial run see if after one tenant you make any kind of reasonable profit in the end and decide from there

if you are planning this as a tax avoidance scheme well it is not the gains will be taxable in your hands and not in the banks hands banks simply do n't cash out the stock at the same price there will be quite a bit of both lawyers and others so in the end you will end up paying more the link indicates that one would pay back the loan via one 's own earnings so if you have a stock worth usd 100 you can pledge this to a bank and get a max loan of usd 50 there are regulations that govern the max you can get against 100 you want to buy something worth usd 50 sell half the stock get usd 50 pay the gains tax on usd 50 pledge the usd 100 stock to bank get a loan of usd 50 as you have not sold anything there is no tax over a period pay the usd 50 loan via your own earnings a high valued customer may be able to get away with a very low rate of intrest and very long repayment period    the tax implication to your legal hier would be from the time the stock come to his her hands to the time she sold so if the price increase to 150 by the time mark dies and its sold at 160 later the gain is only of usd 10 so rather than paying 30 or whatever the applicable tax rate it would be wise to pay an interest of few percentages

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

first off i highly recommend the book get a financial life   the basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward and this book does a great job with it   it is very light reading and it really geared for the young person starting their career   it is n't the most current book pre real estate boom but the recommendations in the book are still sound   update new edition of the book came out now with that out of the way there 's really two kinds of investing to think about for most individuals it is best to take care of 1 first   most people should n't even think about 2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts established an emergency fund and gotten their debt under control there are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing both from your employer and the government   all the more reason to take care of 1 before 2 your employer probably offers some kind of 401k or equivalent like a 403b with a company provided match   this is a potential 100 return on your investment after the vesting period   no investment you make on your own will ever match that   additionally there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k   the money you contribute does n't count as taxable income the best way to start investing is to learn about your employer 's retirement plan and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching beyond this there are also individual retirement accounts iras you can open to contribute money to on your own   you should open one of these and start contributing but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k   the ira wo n't give you that 100 roi that the 401k will keep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much walled off from your day to day financial life   money that goes into a retirement account generally ca n't be touched until retirement age unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties   you generally do n't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account one other thing to note   your 401 k and your ira is an account that you put money into   just because the money is sitting in the account does n't necessarily mean it is invested   you put the money into this account and then you use this money for investments   how you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself   here is a good starting point   if you want to ask questions about retirement portfolios it is probably worth posting a new question

this bit of marketing like the zero percent introductory rates some banks offer is intended to make you more willing to carry a balance and they 're hoping you 'll continue that bad habit after the rate goes back up if you do n't think you 'll be tempted by the lower rate 's no reason not to accept unless there 's something in the fine print that changes your agreement in other ways read carefully but as you say there 's no reason to accept ir either i 'd ignore it

inflation is an increase in the money supply   increases in consumer prices follow from inflation   it 's not the same as inflation some inflation is necessary for a growing economy   if your gross national product is only $ 1,000 then you can get away with having less money than if your gross national product is $ 1 trillion inflation beyond this though is used to allow governments to live beyond their means   if there is more money chasing the same amount of goods prices will rise   there is truth in what says about this kind of inflation   it 's theft governments like inflation because it allows them to pay off their debts with cheaper money

it sounds like they are matching your ira contribution dollar for dollar up to 1 of your salary think of that as an instant 100 yield on your investment your money instantly doubles my 401(k has been doing pretty well over the last year but it will take several years before my money doubles   so you can let it sit in cash for a year then take some pretty hefty fees and you will probably still come out ahead of course it 's hard to say without knowing all of the fees

the is per year not per month not too bad for a regular savings but it 's just interest rates in general that are bad right now the inflation rate should be 3.8 currently so if you hide your money in a bank you 'll end up with a loss of 2 in buying power in a year if you open an cd certificate of deposit the best apy would be around 2.2 for a 5 years one and you will still get hit by the inflation you might want to invest those money somewhere else and in some other ways the stock market might give you excellent entry points soon if not right now but since you 're very young and inexperienced i strongly recommend to do tons of research and ask for advice from experienced people before you jump into these kind of things by yourself

technically of course almost any company can go bankrupt one small note a company goes bankrupt not its stock its stock may become worthless in bankruptcy but a stock disappearing or being delisted does n't necessarily mean the company went bankrupt bankruptcy has implications for a company 's debt as well so it applies to more than just its stock i do n't know of any historical instances where this has happened but presumably the warning signs of bankruptcy would be evident enough that a few things could happen   another company e.g. another exchange holding firm etc could buy out the exchange that 's facing financial difficulty and the companies traded on it would transfer to the new company that 's formed if another exchange bought out the struggling exchange the shares of the latter could transfer to the former this is an attractive option because exchanges possess a great deal of infrastructure already in place depending on the country this could face regulatory scrutiny however other firms or governments could bail out the exchange if no one presented a buyout offer the likelihood of this occurring depends on several factors e.g. political will the in question etc for a smaller exchange the exchange could close all open positions at a set price this is exactly what happened with the hong kong mercantile exchange that mentioned when the exchange collapsed in may 2013 it closed all open positions for their price on the thursday before the shutdown date i do n't know if a stock exchange would simply close all open positions at a set price since equity technically exists in perpetuity regardless of the shutdown of an exchange while many derivatives have an expiration date furthermore this might not be a feasible option for a large exchange for example the chicago mercantile exchange lists thousands of products and manages hundreds of millions of transactions so closing all open positions could be a significant undertaking   if none of the above options were available i presume companies listed on the exchange would actively move to other more financially stable exchanges these companies would n't simply go bankrupt contracts can always be listed on other exchanges as well considering the high level of mergers and acquisitions both unsuccessful and successful   in the market for exchanges in recent years i would assume that option 1 would be the most likely see the nyse deutsche merger talks and the nyse ice merger that 's currently in progress but for smaller exchanges there is the recent historical precedent of the that speaks to 3 also the above answer really only applies to publicly traded stock exchanges and not all stock exchanges are publicly held entities for example the shanghai stock exchange is a quasi governmental organization so i presume option 2 would apply because it already receives government backing its bankruptcy would mean something occurred for the government to withdraw its backing or that it became public and a discussion of those events occurring in the future is pure speculation

yes it makes sense like says the usefulness of technical indicators can not be answered with a simple yes or no some people gain something from it others do not aside from this applying technical indicators or any other form of technical analysis like order flow to instruments which are composed of other instruments such as indexes more accurately a derivative of it does make sense there are many theories why this is the case but personally i believe it is a mixture of self fulfilling prophecy that the instruments the index is composed of like the stocks in the s&p500 are traded in similar ways as the index or rather a trade able derivative of it like etfs and futures and the idea that ta just represents human emotion and interaction in trading this is a very subjective topic so take this with a grain of salt but in contrast to joetaxpayer i believe that yields are not necessary in order to use ta successfully as long as the given instrument is liquid enough ta can be applied and used to gain an edge on the other hand to answer your second question not all stocks in an index correlate all the time and not all of them will move in sync with the index

i 'm glad you did n't say they were the only causes of the bubble and i hope you did n't mean to   but i wo n't argue that those were not partially to blame   i also wo n't say i personally was not partially to blame   now i certainly do n't want to defend the banks at least not a lot of them but i disagree with some of your assertions for one thing they are getting blamed for making loans to readily available and now they are being blamed not by you for not making the money readily available     have you financed any homes   if so did you just go to a bank and get a loan   i 'm sure some people do that but i do n't know anyone who ever has   i go to a loan agent and get a much cheaper loan   and i think part of the problem is that many of these agents have only one overriding objective to enable you to qualify for a loan so they can get their commission   they know all the rules and reasons people get turned down so they play the system and get people loans who should not get them   i do n't really think the banks are as they allow this and in many cases know about it unofficially   but i do n't think it 's a conspiracy by the banks i think the banks were simply naive and thought that the past was a good indicator or the future so the loans were safe because they would get the house if the owner defaulted and the house would be worth at least the value of the equity the owner had after the down payment   lots of people made mistakes on both sides   you can call it a conspiracy if you want but i 've found that most conspiracy theories were simply not real     other than that i totally agree with you

it this a real situation or is it a made up example because for a stock that has a last traded priced of $ 5 or $ 6 and volume traded over $ 4 m i.e. it seems to be quite liquid it is hardly likely that the difference from bid to ask would be as large as $ 1 maybe for a stock that has volume of 4 to 5 thousand but not for one having volume of 4 to 5 million in regards to your question if you were short selling the order would go in exactly the same as if you were selling a stock you owned so your order would be on the ask side and would need to be matched up with a price on the bid side for there to be a trade

this is another semantics question   again what matters is how the words are commonly used as the usage came about long before the technical definitions in this case when people say mutual fund they are often including both unit investment trusts and closed end funds   despite the labels the sec has given in order to differentiate them i 'd say it 's common typical practice to think of a closed end fund as a type of mutual fund rather than a different category altogether   that 's the way i 've seen it used anyway

you 're not talking about capitalism you 're talking about hate for the bourgeois which you refer to as parasites thus making you the you do n't own a business you work for one if you wanted to create a company you could because you have the freedom to so do the opportunity to as this guy did through discipline and determination but you you prefer to debate religion and give people advice and make assertions on the internet   capitalism is an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit taken right from wikipedia   this guy built a company from the garage of a small house driving a 12 year old car while his friends drove new cars and enjoyed healthy salaries today his company has 7,000 employees and lots of revenue who did he exploit it sounds like he produced a service for profit    so what is the fact that his revenue and profit are larger than most his net profit is much lower than gross profit because of already high liabilities not only including various taxes but as much or more in mandatory insurances i 'd wager the net profit is less than half of the gross profit if his liability increases there is less incentive to continue operations    the fact is he created his business and he can do with it what he pleases

based on your numbers it sounds like you 've got 12 years left in the private student loan which just seems to be an annoyance to me   you have the cash to pay it off but that may not be the optimal solution you 've got $ 85k in cash   that 's way too much so your options are   40k 2.25 loan off mortgage 40k play around with this link mortgage calculator paying the student loan and applying the $ to the monthly mortgage reduces your mortgage by 8 years it also reduces the factor of the student loan prepaying the mortgage one time reduces it by 6 years but that reduces the total cost of the mortgage over it 's lifetime the most prepaying the mortgage and re amortizing it over thirty years at the same rate reduces your mortgage payment by $ 210 which you could apply to the student loan but you 'd need to come up with an extra $ 105 a month

my entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product idea and it is differentiated from what exists already you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can and their heart is nt in it the way yours is    i think ultimately it really depends on the product though you definitely do n't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100 beat their version of the product by a good margin either on price or quality and hopefully both and you can scale up quickly

i respectfully disagree with @johnfx 's comment regarding new vs used   john knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations the answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small loud cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years if you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now then a new car can be a fine choice   i just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 hyundai and a comparable 2012 hyundai was n't much   furthermore it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market   doing math in my head told me the reduced usage i will get out of the car was n't offset by the slightly lower price depending on the specific age insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars but you have to have carry more insurance so consider that as well   there might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012 but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013 new cars can be cheaper to operate   lower fuel costs better safety and possibly pollution costs   they are tuned up and you know everything about their history repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car so if you car turns out to be a problem your out of pocket is limited these programs do n't mean anything   get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy   if the dealer wo n't let you get the car checked out then they are n't worth your business   certified cars do n't justify their cost according to consumer reports they are more for marketing than reliability do n't waste money on a third party warranty   either the car is good and does n't need it or it needs a warranty and you should n't buy it   if you new car comes with a factory warranty that is fine   radio host clark howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately but never a third party just out of college you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car if for no other reason this likely is n't going to be your car in the near future   only you can answer that if you have a feeling you wo n't keep your tiny car well into your 30s then definitely do n't buy a new car    also my experience only applies to my make and model   certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used is n't much for the most recent model years but there are many more makes and models that do n't pan out that way

talk freely about what you can now do because of saving if you plan to retire sooner than most or more comfortably than most and can tie that to something you want them to do show them that if you buy a very nice car or install a pool and they wish they could afford that tell them it took 5 or 10 or 20 years to save up for it at x a week and now you have it with no loan or be a cautionary tale wish you had something and regret not having saved for it young adults are generally well served by knowing more of parental finances than they did while they were dependents ask them if they will want or need to fund parental leaves make a down payment for a house own vacation property put a child through post secondary education share the cost of theirs including living expenses if you paid them or go on amazing vacations fairly regularly tell them what those things cost in round figures explain how such a huge sum of money can accumulate over 2 5 10 years of saving x a month for example $ 10 a week is $ 500 a year and so on while they may not want to save 20 years for their downpayment doing this simple math should let them map their savings amounts to concrete wishes and timeframes finally if this is your own child and they live with you charge them rent this will save them from developing the habit of spending everything they earn along with the expensive tastes and selfish speaking habits that come with it some parents set the rent aside and give it back as a wedding or graduation present or to help with a downpayment later but even if you do n't making them live within their true means not the inflated means you have when you 're living rent free is truly a gift

lets say that college costs 100 k per kid and they you have 3 ages and expect tuition and fees inflation of 8 per year you are 40 and want to retire at age 65 and would have to replace 80 of you final years salary and expect your salary to increase 2 above inflation but you do have a pension that based on the number of years of service you will have if you do n't switch companies will replace 40 of you final salary but if you leave now will only cover 15 the equivalent of social security will replace 10 your spouse works part time and has no company provided pension your big single bucket of long term savings has are you on target you ca n't answer the question without first determining how much money each of those individual buckets kid 1 kid 2 kid 3 pension social security and retirement needs to have today and in the future then you take the money you do have and assign it to the buckets of course different accounts have different tax age deposit and use rules also what happens after the last child graduates so the amount of money available each year will change significantly the key to not stealing money from long term savings goals is to realize you also need an emergency fund and a life happens fund that way an engine repair does require you to pull money from the education fund

you did n't answer my questions above but the biggest factor if the two interest rates are similar is what it will cost you for mortgage insurance if you do not include a 20 down payment on your next house purchase i would take the extra money from the proceeds of the other sale to get to a 15-year loan on your next house then put all of your extra money into paying down the student loans ahead of the 7 year schedule

between 1 and 2 g is actually pretty decent for a high school student   your best bet in my opinion is to wait the next small stock market crash and then invest in an index fund a fund that tracks the sp500 or the 2000 would be a good choice by stock market crash i 'm talking about a 20 to 30 drop from the highest point the stock market is at an all time high but nobody knows if it 's going to keep going   i would avoid penny stocks at least until you can read their annual report and understand most of what they 're claiming especially the cash flow statement from the few that i 've looked at penny stock companies just keep issuing stock to raise money for their money loosing operations   i 'd also avoid individual stocks for now you can setup a practice account somewhere online and try trading your classmates probably brag about how much they 've made but they wo n't tell you how much they lost   you are not your money by not doing anything with it your classmates are gambling with it they might as well go to a casino   echoing what others have said investing in yourself is your best option at this point try to get into the best school that you can anything that gives you an edge over other people in terms of experience or education is good so try to get some leadership and team experience and some online classes in a field that interests you

i 'm not sure if you are including the use of credit cards in the intent of your   however i will give you some good reasons i use them even when i can pay cash 1 i get an interest free loan for almost 30 days as long as i do n't carry balances 2 i get a statement detailing where i am spending my money that is helpful for budgeting i 'd never keep track to this level of detail if i were using cash 3 many cards offer reward programs that can be used for cash back 4 it helps maintain my credit rating for those times i need to buy something and pay it off over time car house etc 5 not so much an issue for me personally but for people that live paycheck to paycheck it might help to time your cash outflows to match up with your inflows for a business i think it is mostly a cash flow issue that is in a lot of b2b type businesses customers can pay very slowly managing their own cash flows so your revenue can sometimes lag quite a bit behind the expenses that were associated with them e.g payroll a business line of credit can smooth out the cash flow especially for companies that do n't have a lot of cash reserves

gt;i do nt see what 's the big deal all the banks got bailed out govt printed over 7 trillion bucks not much inflation govt has to help private sector gave plenty of freebies to the rich mother in the banking sector   yes that was bullshit i agree the difference is that most of the money that went to the banks is held with the banks it did n't cause inflation because it is n't circulating in the economy the government also had to do something with the banks because it would have triggered a major depression if they did n't i do n't think they handled it the best way at all they should have nationalized the banks after the bailouts rather than let them keep thriving however students do n't need that extra debt that would be $ 1 trillion extra that actually is circulating in the economy which would cause serious inflation that would mean faqs the amount of money in circulation that is a lot different than the trillions the government printed mostly just to set monetary policy

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

the first thing you should do is write a letter to the collection company telling them that you dispute all charges and demand per section 809 of the fair debt collection practices act that they immediately validate and confirm any and all debts they you owe you should further request that that they only communicate with you by mail section 809 requires them to examine the legal documents showing you allegedly owe a debt and they are required to send this to you this all creates a useful paper trail when you send the letter be sure to send it as certified mail with a return receipt from your description it does n't sound like this will do anything but it 's important you do it within 30 days of them contacting you this is because the law allows them to assume the debt is valid if you do n't do it within 30 days of their initial contact i recommend you speak with an attorney most states have a statute of limitation on debt of about 4 or 5 years i do n't know if that applies to courts though whatever you do be very careful of the language you use when speaking with them always refer to it as the alleged debt or the debt you i owe you do n't want them your words later on as far as proving you paid it i would look through every scrap of paper i 'd ever touched looking for it if that proves fruitless try going to the courthouse and looking through their records if they 're saying you did n't pay that 's a long shot but still worth a try you could also try bank records from that time like if you have a visa statement showing $ paid to the nevada court or something like that if all else fails the law allows you to send the collector a letter saying that you refuse to pay the debt the collection company then legally must stop contacting you unless it 's to tell you they are suing you or to tell you they wo n't contact you again i strongly advise against this though your best bet is going to be speaking with a qualified attorney edit you should also pull your credit reports to make sure this is n't being reported there federal law gives you the right to have a free copy of each of your credit reports once every year if it is being reported send a certified letter with return receipt to each bureau which is reporting it telling them you dispute the information they then are required to confirm the information if they ca n't confirm it they must remove it if they do confirm it you are legally entitled to put a statement disputing the information next to it on your credit report i am not an attorney this is not legal advise you should consult an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

gt boeing 's union workers are overcompensated   compared to who some hypothetical unemployed north by that metric we 're all overcompensated i guarantee you that there 's someone somewhere probably many someones in many that would be happy to do your job for a lot less money does that mean that all publicly traded companies have a duty to demand tax incentives to not move to north carolina or poland or cambodia i may sound hyperbolic about this but i 'm completely serious in that question calling someone overcompensated means that the prevailing wage in the competitive labor market for the same quality of work is lower not just assuming that someone would be willing to do it if you offered them $ 40k and a wrench   the fact is boeing has not been able to produce any compelling data about overcompensated workers the nlrb just ruled that it has failed in doing so with it 's engineering union and has ordered it to back up their post nlrb judge boeing failed bargain good faith so all you 've got is a baseless assertion behind this whole argument   moreover the idea that boeing needs to reduce wages in order to remain competitive is baseless as well that 's easy to say and strikes an intuitive chord with the public but there 's no evidence that boeing needs to do this they may want to do it but they could save the same amount of money in countless other ways stopping making stupid decisions to outsource large components around the world would be a great way to save money for starters reducing wages is a desire not a need

i recently needed to compute a better balance that let us pick and choose what to include in the computed sum without losing information so i this topic and i 'm pleased to say that i 've found a solution that works at least for our data you may have transactions that this code does n't recognize but you can always modify it to match my solution was written for ms sql server 2008 or later it uses a a view and a aggregate sum over order by which means it should be almost syntax compatible with mysql does not support over but you can perform a running sum using a variable with arithmetic addition directly in the select clause create a database table with this feel free to exclude columns you 're not interested in such as create a unique index on you could use it as a primary key i suppose you might be tempted to create a foreign key relationship between and however this will fail if you enforce it we have many transactions where points to a transaction that does n't exist this is usually in the case of type = web accept payment received and status = canceled we also have some values longer than 17 characters some start with all pending money requests i suspect this indicates the transaction is unfinished re download your entire paypal history csv files so that you have the latest retroactive updates import these csv files into this table do a simple test to see how bad paypal 's default data is to find out where the differences are coming from run this query the order by is to ensure consistent ordering when multiple transactions share the same timestamp as you scroll through the results you 'll see how the naive sum is thrown off from the official paypal computed balance column so as you can see the net column value can not always be trusted what we need is to generate our own value which is accurate that is the value is 0.00 for rows which do not affect the balance instead of being what they are right now the problem is given a single row of data such as any single row from the example table in my original question we have no way of inherently knowing what its is i have devised two functions to help solve this problem the first function only looks at the type and status column values and generates accurate values for the vast majority of rows indeed in our dataset we only had one row for which this approach did not work i recommend you try this one first and compare the running sum value to ensure it works for your data you can use this function in the query like so below hopefully it should give you an accurate running sum and balance figure at the end 8 and here 's the view that ties it all together used like so i hope this helps anyone else wanting to do accurate bookkeeping with paypal transaction history files

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

earnings per share is the company profit or loss divided by the number of outstanding shares the number should always be compared to the share price so for instance if the eps is $ 1 and the share price is $ 10 the eps is 10 of the share price this means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10 yearly on your investment long term the stock price may fluctuate but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor if the eps is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved or because the business is expected to grow especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money if the company does n't grow fast enough even if it does make a healthy profit note that the listed eps like most key figures is based on the last financial statement recent developments could mean that better or worse is generally expected also note that the earnings of some companies will fluctuate wildly for instance companies that produce movies or video games will tend to have a huge income for a quarter or two following a new release but may be in the negative in some periods this is fine as long as they turn a profit long term but you will have to look at data for a longer period in order to determine this

if the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months it would mean banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the monthly billing cycle for example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th means if you swipe your card on 1st day one would effectively get a credit for 30 + 14 around 44 days if you swipe on last day one would get a credit for 14 days on an average 22 days of credit if we make this 3 months the credit period would increase on an average 90 + 52 days from a risk point of view on monthly cycle if there is non payment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle on offering different dates shop around in the older times the cycles were different however with individuals having several cards and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates

i asked my realtor but she recommends to go with just one banker    her friend and not to do any rate shopping you need a new realtor anyone who would offer such advice is explicitly stating they are not advocating on your behalf   i 'd do the rate shopping first when you make an offer once it 's accepted time becomes critical the seller expects you to go to closing in so many days after signing the the realtor is specifically prohibited from pushing a particular lender on you she should know better   in response to comment rate shopping can be as simple as making a phone call and having a detailed conversation 's list can be conveyed verbally is the next step where a bank actually writes a letter indicating they have a high confidence you will qualify for the loan

first would be that depending on the stuff you are selling you are likely to get a better response from craigslist or for many things the shipping cost will outweigh the value so any kind of local transaction would be preferred   the standard will combine shipping can be an ebay offered incentive for people who want more than one of your things smaller high value items would of course be the exception to the previous rule   there the broad reach of ebay might well bring you a better price   standard consumer electronics however would likely not fit into this category as they change so quickly depending on the amount of stuff you have two other ideas come to mind   there are likely local flea markets that charge just a few bucks for tables to sell whatever you like   and do n't forget the garage sale a favourite weekend pastime for many in canada

there are two primary reasons shares are sold short   1 to speculate that a stock 's price will decline and 2 to hedge some other related financial exposure the first is acknowledged by the question   the second reason may be done for taxes shorting against the box was once permitted for tax purposes for arbitrage positions such as merger arbitrage and situations when an outright sale of stock is not permitted such as owning restricted stock such as employer granted shares why would a shareholder lend the investor the shares the investor loaning his stock out to short sellers earns interest on those shares that the borrower pays   it is not unusual for the annualized cost of borrowing stock to be double digits when there is high demand for heavily shorted shares   this benefit is however not available to all investors

predictions especially doomsday predictions can go wrong quickly   i would be careful of anyone calling an end to a country like the u.s. especially if they have something to gain and a history of being wrong   on the other hand someone warning of something with a past of financial credibility can be quite useful   for instance compare frank stansberry to jesse colombo on twitter   jesse was one of the few who predicted the financial crisis in 2004 and is currently warning of new bubbles ie the higher education bubble even admitting to profiting off of some of them and encouraging others to do the same   however his assertions can be investigated to verify accuracy but they are hardly the end of the end in fact jesse likes to boast that he 's an and thinks eventually we 'll usher in a golden age   frank stansberry on the other hand does n't seem to carry the credibility a brief internet search generated some issues he 's had with the sec about misleading investors completely forgot to add mike mish also has made some predictions that have come true and with some other financial advisers over inflation vs. deflation   while people were screaming hyper inflation back in 2008 2009 mish constantly attacked them for being wrong and has continued to be right   some of his political views of course are n't popular but some of his financial predictions have been stellar anyone who warns of anything should always be checked out for both what they 've said what they are currently saying and what their agenda is   as one of my mentors warned me everyone has an agenda and that 's not always bad their agenda may align with yours just make sure it does on a humorous side note my father has predicted the end of the world every six months since 1994

a stock insurance company is structured like a normal company it has shareholders that are the company 's investors who elect a board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company the directors and thus the executives and employees have a legal responsibility to manage the company in a way which is beneficial for the shareholders since the shareholders are the ultimate owner of the company a mutual insurance company is similar except that the people holding policies are also the shareholders that is the policyholders are the ultimate owners of the company and there generally are n't separate shareholders who are just investing in the company these shareholders elect the board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company in practice it probably does n't really make a whole lot of difference since even if you 're just a customer and not an owner of the company the company is still going to want to attract customers and act in a reasonable way toward them also insurance companies are generally pretty heavily regulated in terms of what they can do because governments really like them to remain solvent it may be comforting to know that in a mutual insurance company the higher ups are explicitly supposed to be working in your best interest though rather than in the interest of some random investors some might object that being a shareholder may not give you a whole lot more rights than you had before see for example this article from the boston globe at mutual insurance firms big money for insiders but no say for policyholders it has grown into something else entirely an opaque poorly understood and often immensely profitable world in which some executives and insiders operate with minimal scrutiny and no coincidence often reap maximum personal rewards policyholders despite their status as owners have no meaningful oversight of how mutual companies spend their money whether to lower rates pay dividends or fund executive salaries and perks and few avenues to challenge such decisions another reason that one might not like the conversion is the specific details of how the current investor shareholders are being paid back for their investment in the process of the conversion to mutual ownership and what that might do to the funds on hand that are supposed to be there to keep the firm solvent for the policyholders from another boston globe article on the conversion of sbli to a mutual company insurer sbli wants to get banks out of its business professor robert wright is cautiously optimistic but wants to ensure the prior shareholders are n't overpaid robert wright a professor in south dakota who has studied insurance companies and owns an sbli policy said he would prefer the insurer to be a mutual company that does n’t have to worry about the short term needs of shareholders but he wants to ensure that sbli does n’t overpay the banks for their shares it ’s fine as long as it ’s a fair price he said that article also gives sbli 's president 's statement as to why they think it 's a good thing for policyholders if the banks remained shareholders they would be likely to demand a greater share of the profits and eat into the dividends the insurance company currently pays to the policyholders about half of whom live in massachusetts said jim morgan president of based sbli we ’re trying to protect the policyholders from having the dividends diluted morgan said i 'm not sure there 's an obvious pros cons list for either way but i 'd think that i 'd prefer the mutual approach just on the principle that the policyholders ought to be the owners because the directors and thus the executives and employees are then legally required to manage the company in the best interest of the policyholders i did cast a yes vote in my proxy on whether sbli ought to become a mutual company i 'm a sbli term life but policy terms are n't changing and it 'd be hard to tell for sure how it 'd impact any dividends i assume the whole life policies must be the ones to pay dividends or company solvency either way since it 's not like we 'll get to run a scientific experiment trying it out both ways i doubt you 'd have a lot of regrets either way whether it becomes a mutual company and you wish it had n't or it does n't become one and you wish it had

as other answers have pointed out professional real estate investors do own residential investment properties however small residential units typically are not owned by professional real estate investors as your experience confirms this has a fairly natural cause the size of the investment opportunity is insufficient to warrant the proper research due diligence to which a large investment firm would have to commit if it wanted to properly assess the potential of a property for a small real estate fund managing say $ 50 mm it would take 100 properties at a $ 500 k valuation in order to fully invest the funds this number grows quickly as we decrease the average valuation to reflect even smaller individual units it is unlikely that you will find large institutional investors buying stocks with market caps of $ 20 mm they simply can not invest a large enough portion of total aum to make the diligence make economic sense   as such institutional real estate money tends to find its way into large multi family units that provide a more convenient purchase size for a fund

even if we accept these claims as being true neither the fact that their clients are more confident nor the fact that people who use an investment professional have a higher net worth tells you anything about the value of the service that such professionals provide   judging a service provider is a complex matter where you take into account multiple variables but the main ones are the cost and quality of the service the cost and quality of doing it yourself and the value you assign to your time and effort i think it 's highly likely that professional gardeners will on average maintain larger gardens than those who do their own garden work and any professional will have more experience at his profession than an average member of the public but to determine if hiring a professional is objectively better requires defining what that word means finance is a bit weird in that respect since we actually do have objective ways of measuring results by looking at performance over time but since the quotes you give here do n't address that at all we can simply conclude that they do not make the case for anything related to financial performance

as you 've observed when you 're dealing with that amount of money you 're going to have to give up fdic guarantees that means that keeping the money in a bank account carries some risk with it if that particular bank goes bust you could lose most of your money there are a few options to stretch the fdic limit such as cdars but likely ca n't handle your hypothetical $ 800 million so what 's a lucky winner to do there are a few options including treasury securities money market funds and more general capital investments such as stocks and bonds which are best depend on what your goals are and what kind of risks you find acceptable money in the bank has two defining characteristics its value is very stable and it is liquid meaning you can spend it very easily whenever you want without incurring costs treasury securities and money market funds each focus on one of these characteristics a treasury security is a piece of paper or really an electronic record saying that the us federal government owes you money and when they will pay it back they are very secure in that the government has never missed a payment and will move heaven and earth to make sure they wo n't miss one in the future even taking into account recent political history you can buy and sell them on an open market either through a broker or directly on the treasury 's website the major downside of these compared to a bank account is that they 're not as liquid as cash you own specific amounts of specific kinds of securities not just some number of dollars in an account the government will pay you guaranteed cash on specified dates if you need cash on different dates you will need to sell the securities in the open market and the price will be subject to market fluctuations the other cash like option is money market funds these are a type of mutual fund offered by financial companies these funds take your money and spread it out over a wide variety of very low risk very short term investments with the goal of ensuring that the full value will never go down and is available at any time they are very liquid you can typically transfer cash quickly and easily to a normal bank account write checks directly and sometimes even use online bill pay like features they have a very good track record for stability too but no one is guaranteeing them against something going terribly wrong they are lower risk than a non fdic insured bank account since the investments are spread out across many institutions beyond those two somewhat cash like options there are of course other more general investments such as stocks bonds and real estate these other options trade away some degree of stability liquidity or both in exchange for better expected returns

whenever you put less than 20 down you are usually required to pay private mortgage insurance pmi to protect the lender in case you default on your loan   you pay this until you reach 20 equity in your home   check out an amortization calculator to see how long that would take you   most schedules have you paying more interest at the start of your loan and less principal   pmi gets you nothing no interest or principal paid it 's throwing money away in a very real sense more in this answer   still if you want to do it make sure to add pmi to the cost per month it is also possible to get two mortgages one for your 20 down payment and one for the 80 and avoid pmi   lenders are fairly cautious about doing that right now given the housing crash but you may be able to find one who will let you do the two mortgages   this will raise your monthly payment in its own way of course also remember to factor in the costs of home ownership into your calculations   check the county or city website to figure out the property tax on that home divide by twelve and add that number to your payment   estimate your homeowners insurance of course you get to drop renters insurance so make sure to calculate that on the renting side of the costs and divide the yearly cost by 12 and add that in   most importantly add 1 2 of the value of the house yearly for maintenance and repair costs to your budget   all those costs are going to eat away at your 3 400 a little bit   so you 've got to save about $ 70 a month towards repairs etc for the case of every 10 50 years when you need a new roof and so on many experts suggest having the maintenance money in savings on top of your emergency fund from day one of ownership in case your water heater suddenly dies or your roof starts leaking   make sure you 've also estimated closing costs on this house or that the seller will pay your costs   otherwise you loose part of that from your down payment or other savings once you add up all those numbers you can figure out if buying is a good proposition   with the plan to stay put for five years it sounds like it truly might be   i 'm not arguing against it just laying out all the factors for you the nyt rent versus buy calculator lays out most of these items in terms of renting or buying and might help you make that decision edit as tim noted in the comments below real monthly cost should take into account deductions from mortgage interest and property tax paid   this calculator can help you figure that out   this question will be one to watch for answers on how to calculate cost and return on home buying with the answer by mbhunter being an important qualification

the first thing that it is important to note here is that the examples you have given are not individual bond prices   this is what is called the generic bond price data in effect a bond with the indicated maturity period   you can see individual bond prices on the uk debt management office website the meaning of the various attributes price yield coupon remains the same but there may be no such bond to trade in the market   so let 's take the example of an actual uk gilt say the 4.25 treasury gilt 2019   the uk debt management office currently lists this bond as having a maturity date of and a price of gbp   this means that you will pay to purchase a bond with a nominal value of gbp 100.00   here the nominal price is the price that hm treasury will buy the bond back on the maturity date    note that the title of the bond indicates a nominal yield of 4.25   this is called the coupon so here the coupon is 4.25   in other words the treasury will pay gbp 4.25 annually for each bond with a nominal value of gbp 100.00   since you will now be paying a price of gbp to purchase this bond in the market today this means that you will be paying to earn the nominal annual interest of 4.25   this equates to a yield where =    it is very important to understand that the yield is not the whole story   in particular since the bond has a nominal value of gbp100 this means that as the maturity date approaches the market price of the bond will approach the nominal price of 100 in this case this means that you will witness a loss of capital over the period that you hold the bond   if you hold the bond until maturity then you will lose gbp for each nominal gbp100 bond you hold   when this capital loss is netted off the interest recieved you get what is called the gross redemption yield   in this case the gross redemption yield is given as approximately 0.75 per annum nb   the data table you have included clearly has errors in the pricing of the 3 month 6 month and 12 month generics

and he pays taxes which contribute to that in an absolute dollar amount he probably pays more than most do combined and since his income is from a company and not capital gains his tax rate is definitely above 30 thus providing for the next generation    he 's not suggesting that he should n't pay any taxes at all just not increased taxes or liabilities those roads schools police were all funded just fine before this debate not to mention these are all local taxes and the increased liabilities we are talking about are federally mandated not locally    we have a spending problem not a revenue problem and the solution begins with gutting military spending and it ends with a very serious discussion and long term look at social security and medicare it 's only when the government wants military and those other services that private individuals and industries are squeezed with additional overhead cost liabilities    thing is this guy has done what he has done for 40 + years and has seen 5 10 presidential administrations and the message and policy goals change everytime his resistance is related to additional burdens put on him and his company it is then his to decide whether that extra weight is worth it plain and simple just as you would do just as any company would and does do    this particular event has been by his own and observer 's emotions but i do n't think he 's in the wrong here most of the people criticizing him will never come anywhere close to contributing in tax revenue the amount that he does not to mention jobs    we need more passionate people debate but unfortunately so many people on reddit especially feel the economy government and business has not served them well but the government is the only one offering them the promise of a tiny bit better private industry can not yield confidence or national attention the way the government can but the government is notoriously at and programs but the net result is people will vote for a populist agenda such as letting young people stay on their parent 's health insurance while living at home when what they really want is a $ 75,000 job and the freedom that brings to go after your ambitions

in a free market supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity price is one of the variables that demand   but the problem is employment is n't a free market you can not freely decide not to accept a job because you need some income to live    the wage of an employee especially at the unskilled tier is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs and better yet those jobs can be into shifts and so you can employ more people for less hours or vice versa    the employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result and it 's only connected to the free market of the value of service of a burger    so i 'd guess the market value would steadily drop to about the cost of living in the local area maybe a little below even because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family and further still you can have people themselves by working additional hours    so i reckon you 'd get equilibrium at about 90 of local cost of living if you work an 80 hour week

you raise a good point about the higher marginal rates for 401 k but things will be different in retirement than they are for you now   first off you are going to have a boat load of money   like probably a multi millionaire   also your ability to invest will probably increase greater than the maximum allowable to invest   for this money you might choose to invest in real estate debt payoff or non qualified mutual funds    so fast forward to retirement time   you have a few million in your 401 k you own your house and outright and maybe a couple of rental properties   for one your expenses are much lower   you do n't have to invest pay social security taxes or service debt   clothing gas dry cleaning are all lower as well    you will draw some income off of non qualified plans   this might include rental real estate business income or equity investments   you can also draw social security income   for most of us social security will provide sustenance living   enough for food medical transportation etc   add in some non qualified income and the fact that you are debt free or nearly so and you might not need to draw on your 401k.    plus if you do need to withdraw you can cherry pick when and what amount you withdraw   compare that to now your employer pays you your salary   most of us do not have the ability to defer our compensation   with a 401 k you can for example lets say you want a new car where you need to withdraw from your 401 k to pay for it    in retirement you can withdraw the full amount and pay cash   part of this money will be taxed at the lowest rate part at higher rates   car price dependent in retirement you can take a low interest or free loan and only withdraw enough to make the payments this year   presumably this will be at the lowest rate now you only have one choice   using your top marginal rate to pay for the car   it does n't matter if you have a loan or not

yes your basic math is correct if your tax bracket never changes then either type of retirement account will end up in the same place assuming that there are no income restrictions that will limit your ability to contribute to the type of account you want now your job is to guess what your tax bracket will be each and every year for the next 3 or 4 decades events that will influence your bracket getting married having children buying a house selling a house paying for college the cost of medical care moving to a state with a different state tax structure of course that assumes that you do n't get a big bonus one year or that congress changes the tax brackets that is why many people have both types of retirement accounts roth and non roth

it would help if we had numbers to walk you through the analysis current balance rate remaining term and the new mortgage details   to echo and elaborate on part of ben 's response the most important thing is to not confuse cash flow with savings if you have 15 years to go and refinance to 30 years at the rate rate your payment drops by 1/3 yet your rate is identical in this example   the correct method is to take the new rate plug it into a mortgage calculator or spreadsheet using the remaining months on the current mortgage and see the change in payment this savings is what you should divide into closing costs to calculate the breakeven it 's up to you whether to adjust your payments to keep the term the same after you close   with respect to keshlam rules of thumb often fail there are mortgages that build the closing costs into the rate not the amount loaned the rate this means that as rates dropped moving from 5.25 to 5 made sense even though with closing costs there were 4.5 mortgages out there because rates were still falling and i finally moved to a 3.5 loan at the time i was serial refinancing the bank said i could return to them after a year if rates were still lower in my opinion we are at a bottom and the biggest question you need to answer is whether you 'll remain in the house past your own breakeven time last with personal finance focusing on personal the analysis should n't ignore the rest of your balance sheet say you are paying $ with 15 years to go your budget is tight enough that you 've chosen not to deposit to your 401(k assuming you are in the us or country with pretax retirement account options in this case holding rates constant a shift to 30 years frees up about $ 500/mo in a matched 401(k your $ is doubled to $ 12k year   of course if the money would just go in the market unmatched members here would correctly me for suggesting a dangerous game in effect borrowing via mortgage to invest in the market the matched funds however are tough to argue against

healthcare for the employee is more valuable to the employer than is providing healthcare for the rest of the family members   depending on the family situation you 're going to see significant differences in price between out of pocket costs for insurance of just the employee vs cost for insuring the entire family   this is because in the first instance the insurance is more subsidized by the company as a percentage of the total cost    the costs to the company for insuring just the individual mid career are in the neighborhood of $ 5000 per year   if this is all that 's being negotiated single person coverage then i would use that amount as a baseline

yes and the reason for that is because things that are above the market eg regulators politicians et al manipulate it constantly   i think personally the market is still a price discovery mechanism the rules of the game have just changed i.e. risk now has taken on additional dimensions so a lot of conventional theories of asset pricing can effectively be out the window    whether we ever see the return to a more econ driven reality in market expectations and by that extent therefore asset pricing is anyone 's guess for now bye bye to the established light touch framework of decades past hello to randomness

unfortunately you ca n't use your hsa to pay for expenses in year a. qualified medical expenses for an hsa must occur after the date the hsa account was established established typically means the date the account was opened in your name the other answers already mostly answered your other questions but i want to really hit home some particular points that many people may not realize the most important thing to do when you are eligible to have an hsa account is to open an hsa account asap this is true even if you do n't put any money in it and you leave it empty for years the reason is that once the account is established all qualified medical expenses that occur after that date are eligible for distributions even if you wait years before you fund your hsa account the second most important thing to do is to keep track of all out of pocket medical expenses you incur after you open the hsa account all you need is a simple spreadsheet and a place to store your receipts once you have the account and are tracking expenses now you can put money into your hsa and take it out whenever you 'd like with you ca n't put in more than the contribution limit for a single tax year and you ca n't take out more than your eligible expenses to date helpful tip many people do n't fund their hsa because they ca n't afford to set aside extra money to do so fortunately you do n't have to for example suppose you have some dental work and it costs you $ 500 once you get the bill before you pay it put the $ 500 into your hsa account the next day take the $ 500 back out and pay your dental bill with it most hsa accounts will give you a debit card to make this even easier to pay the bill by putting the money into your hsa for 1 day you just received a $ 500 tax deduction alternatively you can always pay out of pocket like you normally would track your receipts and wait until the end of the year or up until april 15 of the next year i like this option because i can pay all of my medical bills with a credit card and get cash back then at the end of the year i add up the expenses deposit that much into my hsa and if i 'd rather put that money somewhere else i just pull it out the next day if you decide you do n't need the money right away that 's even better since you can leave it in the hsa account and invest it like a roth account you do n't pay tax on the growth you achieve inside of an hsa another tip if your employer offers the service of automatically making deposits into your hsa by reducing your paycheck you should definitely try to do that if you can afford it rather than manually making contributions as i described in the previous tip when your employer makes the contributions for you your wages are reduced by that amount on your w2 so you end up saving an additional 7 in fica taxes

some of the items required as part of the home buying and mortgage process are traditionally paid prior to closing these are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process home inspection credit check these expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller does n't want to get stuck paying for the buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition even for the items that the buyer has to pay for there can be a negotiation between the   buyer and the lender sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years but not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand this is in addition to the down payment and the costs of moving    the closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal how many other bidders there were and do they need the cash to buy their next house at settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it then each side is credited for the items they paid for already then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer real estate commissions there are also items such as interest for the current month and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year   sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing   though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan

it is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate that is how the bank gets its money   usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks so that means that typically the money you have in the bank is gradually losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate   so if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds

as well as paying 8 interest on your loan i.e. $ you 're also wasting money on the car depreciation insurance etc so it 's worth a lot to you to get out of it set against that is the risk of having to borrow the $ 3000 you 'll be taking from your emergency fund at a higher interest rate say 30 for at most 6 months which would only cost you $ 300-$400 even if it happens you 'll also be giving up a small amount of interest on the $ 3000 but at current interest rates that pretty much negligible there is a small chance that an emergency would also cause the available credit on your credit cards to disappear but in the short term that should be pretty unlikely so i think the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of getting out of the loan as soon as you can

a futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date   in the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined in your example the s&p 500 spx is a price return index that is it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value   dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value   since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated this has already been factored into the futures price by the market in terms of the impact of a dividend by aapl aapl is 3.6 of the index   apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out $ dividends   assuming the market is otherwise steady and aapl drops by $ due to the dividend and apple is priced at around $ 105 this would result in a drop in the index of or around 0.35 points interesting fact   there are some futures contracts that are based upon total return indexes such as the german dax and the above logic would need to be reversed

the reason is that although the american economy is functioning normally mortgage rates are stupid low and are below a prudent expectation of long term 30 year rates of return in the market    i manage endowments so i say prudent in the context of endowment investment which is the picture of caution and subject to law the p being prudent     what 's more there are tax benefits   yes you pay 15 long term capital gains tax on investment income   but your mortgage interest is tax deductible at your tax bracket rate of 25 28 or 33 this being the tax you would pay on your next dollar of earned income   and in the early years of a mortgage mortgage payments are nearly 100 interest   so even if it 's a wash you gain $ 10k in the market but pay $ 10k in mortgage interest you pay $ 1500 tax on the gains but the interest deduction tax by $ 2800 so you are still $ 1300 ahead    tldr the government pays us to do this

the general idea is that if the statement was n't true there would be an arbitrage opportunity   you 'll probably want to do the math yourself to believe me   but theoretically you could borrow money in country a at their real interest rate exchange it then invest the money in the other country at country b 's interest rate   generating a profit without any risk   there are a lot of assumptions that go along with the statement like borrowing and lending have the same costs but i 'm sure that is assumed wherever you read that statement

insurance is bought for peace of mind and to divert disaster    diverting disaster is a good great thing   if your house burned down if someone hit your car or some other devastating event think medical happened that required a more allocation than you could afford the series of issues may snowball and cause you to lose a far greater amount of money than the initial incident   this could be in the form of losing work time losing a job having to buy transportation quickly paying a premium having to incur high rate debt and so on    for the middle income and lower classes medical house and medical insurance certainly falls into these categories   also why a lot of states have buyout options on auto insurance some will let you drive without insurance by proving bonding up to 250k.    now the other insurance as i have alluded to is for peace of mind mainly   this is your laptop insurance vacation insurance and so on   the premise of these insurances is that no matter what happens you can get back to even by paying just a little extra    however what other answers have failed to clarify is the idea of insurance   it is an agreement that you will pay a company money right now   and then if a certain set of events happen you follow their guidelines they are still in business they still have the same protocols and so on that you will get some benefit when something happens to you   we buy insurance because we think we can snap our fingers and life will be back to normal   for bigger things like medical home and auto there are more regulations but i could get 1000 comments on people getting screwed over by their insurance companies   for smaller things almost all insurance is outsourced to a 3rd party not affiliated legally with a business   therefore if the costs are too high they can simply go under and if the costs are low they continue helping the consumer that does n't need help    so we buy insurance divert catastrophe or because we have fallen for the insurance sales pitch   and an easy way to get around the sales pitch as the person selling you the insurance if you can have their name and info and they will be personally liable if the insurance company fails their end of the bargain

i worked for a major car rental company not but comparable for quite a while taking reservations by phone i completely agree that the reservation system is terrible and is only vaguely based on the reality of their vehicles in stock at best the problem is from a strictly business perspective taking more reservations than they have cars is currently considered the most profitable model for them   to play devil 's advocate just a little switching to a take only one reservation per vehicle reserve it to 100 lock it in model is a bit more complicated than it sounds in order to guarantee a specific car for a customer at a specific time they either have to leave that car sitting on their lot until you rent it not making money or keep renting it out to other people in the interim if they rent it out to someone else before your rental comes up that removes the vehicle from their control bordering on constantly renters do n't return the vehicle within their promised schedule or return it in a damaged or otherwise unsuitable condition to be clear i 'm not trying to make excuses for the rental car company there are many reasons i no longer work there but it 's objectively hard for them to get a specific vehicle if say all but one of them were in wrecks the previous night and the person renting the last one drove it across the country without warning the rental office and refuses to come back those problems all get solved eventually but that does n't help you when you show up and ca n't get the car you reserved   so they continue to take excessive reservations and just give people whatever they happen to have when they show up if they have any cars at all    there 's definitely better ways to do it for the customer but like many businesses they 'll continue to do it whatever way they determine is best for their profits   edit words

first off inflation does n't necessarily imply that goods and services will rise in price   the amount of goods amp services increases over time as well and this is balanced partly by an increase in the money supply   without inflation you lose the incentive to invest as your dollar would become more valuable over time   why invest in a risky venture if i know that my dollar will buy more if i just wait it out   might as well stick the money under the mattress this is bad

though i do think it is important to have a diversified portfolio for your retirement i also think it 's more important to make sure you are at no point touching this money until you retire taking money out of your retirement early is a sure fire way to get in a bad habit of spending this money when you need a little help here 's a tip if you consider this money gone you will find another way to figure out your situation   with that said i also would rather not put a percentage on this start by building your emergency fund you 'll want to treat this like a bill and make a monthly payment to your savings account each month or paycheck when you have a good nine times your monthly income in here stop contributing to this fund instead start putting the same amount into your ira instead at this point you should no longer have to add to your emergency fund unless there is a true emergency and you are replacing that money keep in mind that the amount of money in your emergency fund changes significantly in each situation sit down with your bills and think about how much money you would need in the event you lost your job how long would you be out of work how many bills do you have each month that would need to be covered

there 's an old adage in the equities business buy on rumor sell on fact   sometimes the strategy is to buy as soon as the rumor is out about a potential merger and then sell off into the news when it is actually announced since this is normally when the biggest bounce occurs as part of a merger the other part of the analysis you should do is to understand which of the companies benefits most or is hurt the worst by the merger and then make your play accordingly   sometimes the company being acquired will see a bounce while the acquiring firm takes a hit which is an indication the experts think the acquisition will be a drag on the acquiring company perhaps because it is taking on a great deal of debt to make the acquisition or because the acquiring firm is paying too much of a premium for what it 's getting in return   other times the exact opposite is true where the company being acquired takes a hit while the buyer bounces and again the reasons for this can vary widely if you wait until the merger is actually announced then by the time you get in most of the premium from the announcement will likely have already been realized and you 'll be buying near the top of the market for the stock   the key is to be ahead of the other sellers by seeing the opportunities before they do and then knowing when to get out before everyone else does   not an easy thing to pull off when you 're trying to anticipate the markets but it can be done if you do the right research and have patience good luck

you would n't have to pay income taxes on the portion for health insurance   think of high deductible health plans the employer puts the deductible into a healthcare savings account which is tax free as long as it 's for medical care   right now you can also deduct the portion of your overall expenses that are medical over a portion of your income   2 issues with your idea though   1   right now there are people who ca n't get health insurance except through an employer   send them out into the marketplace and they will get turned down   obamacare is supposed to fix this but if romney is elected it will continue 2   healthcare inflation rises much higher than regular inflation so if your benefits were included as part of wages and you had to buy it on your own you would face a continually decreasing amount of money over time to purchase healthcare a spiral   this is the issue that many have with the voucher system the republicans are proposing for medicare the voucher will rise at inflation while healthcare rises much higher than inflation right now i think it 's a difference of 1 versus 8 9 off the top of my head   also for many industries it 's in the best interest of the company to have a healthy workforce

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

these are the things to focus on do not put yourself in debt with a car there are other better solutions   1 get a credit card unless you already have one this and get the best cash back or points card you can get at the best rate   start with buying gas and groceries every month do not run the balance up pay the card off every single month this is important never carry a balance above 25 of your credit limit   every 8 months or so call your credit card company and ask for a credit line increase they should be able to do this without pulling your credit you are only looking for the automatic increment that they can automatically approve this will help increase your available credit and will help keep your credit utilization low only do this is you are successfully doing the other bullet points above   2 pay all of your bills on time this includes everything from water electricity phone bill etc never be late setup automatic payments if you can   3 minimize the number of hard credit inquiries is particularly important when you are looking for your mortgage lender do not let them pull your credit automatically you should be able to provide them your credit score and other information and get quotes from those lenders do not let them tell you then ca n't do this they can   plan when you close a credit line closing them will do two things lower your credit limit often times increasing your credit utilization and it may hurt your average age of credit open one credit card and keep it forever   note credit karma is a great tool you should check your score monthly and see how your efforts are influencing your score i also like citi credit cards because they will provide you monthly with your fico score which credit karma will only provide transunion and equifax   this is educational information and you should consider talking to a banker lender who can also give you more detailed instructions on how to get your credit improved so that they can approve you for a loan   many people can get their score above 720 in 1 2 years time going from no credit doing the steps described above it does take time be patient and do n't fall for gimmicks

there are many different methods for a corporation to get money but they mostly fall into three categories earnings debt and equity   earnings would be just the corporation 's accumulation of cash due to the operation of its business perhaps if cash was needed for a particular reason immediately a business may consider selling a division or group of assets to another party and using the proceeds for a different part of the business debt is money that to put it simply the corporation legally must repay to the lender likely with periodic interest payments apart from the interest payments if any and the principal original amount the lender has no additional rights to the value of the company there are basically 2 types of corporate debt bank debt and bonds   bank debt is just the corporation taking on a loan from a bank bonds are offered to the public ie you could potentially buy a tesla bond where you give tesla $ 1k and they give you a stated interest rate over time and principal repayments according to a schedule which type of debt a corporation uses will depend mostly on the high cost of offering a public bond the relationships with current banks and the interest rates the corporation thinks it can get from either method equity or shares is money that the corporation to put it simply likely does not have a legal obligation to repay until the corporation is liquidated sold at the end of its life and all debt has already been repaid but when the corporation is liquidated the shareholders have a legal right to the entire value of the company after those debts have been paid so equity holders have higher risk than debt holders but they also can share in higher reward that is why stock prices are so volatile the value of each share fluctuates based on the perceived value of the entire company   some equity may be offered with specific rules about dividend payments maybe they are required a preferred share likely has a stated dividend rate almost like a bond but also likely has a limited value it can ever receive back from the corporation maybe they are at the discretion of the board of directors maybe they will never happen there are 2 broad ways for a corporation to get money from equity a private offering or a public offering a private offering could be a small mom and pop store asking their neighbors to invest 5k so they can repair their business 's roof or it could be an angel investor think shark tank contributing significant value and maybe even taking control of the company perhaps shares would be offered to all current shareholders first a public offering would be one where shares would be offered up to the public on the stock exchange so that anyone could subscribe to them why a corporation would use any of these different methods depends on the price it feels it could get from them and also perhaps whether there are benefits to having different shareholders involved in the business ie an angel investor would likely be involved in the business to protect his her investment and that leadership may be what the corporation actually needs as much or more than money whether a corporation chooses to gain cash from earnings debt or equity depends on many factors including but not limited to 1 what assets earnings potential it currently has 2 the cost of acquiring the cash ie the high cost of undergoing a public offering vs the lower cost of increasing a bank loan and 3 the ongoing costs of that cash to both the corporation and ultimately the other shareholders ie a 3 interest rate on debt vs a 6 dividend rate on preferred shares vs a 5 dividend rate on common shares which would also share in the net value of the company with the other current shareholders   in summary earnings would be generally preferred but if the company needs cash immediately that may not be suitable debt is generally cheap to acquire and interest rates are generally lower than required dividend rates equity is often expensive to acquire and maintain either through dividend payments or by reduction of net value attributable to other current shareholders but may be required if a new venture is risky ie a bank bondholder may not want to lend money for a new tech idea because it is too risky to just get interest from they want access to the potential earnings as well through equity

well it certainly has the first mover advantage i imagine tesla has become pretty efficient in its production of electric cars and they are continuously driving down costs as production expands tesla is gaining economies of scale allowing it to produce electric vehicles for much cheaper than any other company might do with its patents i think it would be difficult for new entrants to achieve the same quality and cost that tesla does even if they are using tesla 's patents    furthermore tesla and electric vehicles have become synonymous if someone is going to buy an electric car the first thing they are going to think of is tesla owning a tesla has become and will likely continue to be a bit of a status symbol and because of that i think they will probably always have the dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and will likely be able to charge premium prices that competitors might not be able to justify similar to the way that despite the ubiquity of smartphones apple has a dominant position and an ability to charge premium prices largely because apple kind of drove the smartphone revolution    tesla wants the electric car market to grow as quickly as possible the more money automobile manufacturers pour into electric cars the less they will spend on cheaper fossil fuel vehicles secondly as more companies start producing electric vehicles more people will end up owning one hence more infrastructure will be built to support those people making owning an electric car a lot easier hence increasing the value of a tesla making electric cars accessible to the mainstream public is tesla 's ultimate goal because they know they will likely always have the lion 's share of that industry

the more i think about this the more i think you are actually better off letting it go to collections at least then you would be able to agree an affordable repayment schedule based on your real budget and having a big dent in your credit score because it 's gone to collections does n't actually put you in any worse position in terms of acquiring credit in the future than you are now   whoever is the creditor on your original loan is imo quite unreasonable demanding a payment in full on a given date especially given that you say you 've only been made aware of this debt recently the courts are usually much more reasonable about this sort of thing and recognise that a payment plan over several years with an affordable monthly payment is much more likely to actually get the creditor their money back than any other strategy they will also recognise and appreciate that you have made significant efforts to obtain the money i 'm also worried about your statement about how panicked and ready to give up you are is there someone you can talk to around here uk we have debt counselling bureaus they ca n't help with money for the actual debt itself but they can help you with strategies for dealing with debt and will explain all parts of the process to you what your rights and responsibilities are if it does go to court etc if you have something similar i suggest you contact them even just to speak to someone and find out that this is n't the end of the world it 's a situation but in a few years you 'll be able to look back and at least laugh at it

gt instead we give money to banks tax breaks for the already wealthy and then deregulate finance when the problem seemed to stem from deregulation and non enforcement   what deregulation there is no deregulation in the banking sector the fact that the banks got bailed out with taxpayer dollar is proof that the market is far too regulated failed banks are not allowed to fail you can not possibly have a more regulated market than that    we need to deregulate the market therefore letting shitty banks fail

my wife and i chose to share all bank accounts and credit cards we did so because we realized that over the course of a marriage the pendulum of who is the primary may shift repeatedly having one account gets us in the habit of thinking about our needs and wants together and any transitions that may come as one or the other of us quits a job returns to school reduces hours i should also say that this system would likely not work well if either partner has semi compulsive spending consumption habits i 'd recommend separate bank accounts with a joint account for your mortgage in that situation

i bought a house 6 months ago for $ 240,000 on an $ 80k salary am getting by just fine and am able to save money and i live on long island an extremely expensive area to live i would look at finding a few more interest rate quotes for instance wells fargo is offering 4.25 right now for fha first time home buyers loan which only require 3.5 down a lower interest rate will lower your monthly payment make the banks compete with one another this little bit of leg work will save you thousands upon thousands of dollars in the long run also try to negotiate to not paying a point down on the mortgage most of the time they are bull especially in this economy banks are desperate for new loans   however as others have said do not assume or count on rent coming in to be able to afford your mortgage unless you are married what if your friend moves out and you can not find another tenant   however i strongly recommend you talk to a financial adviser and your bank mortgage loan officer to work out the numbers you will be surprised what you can afford when you factor in your income tax and mortgage interest write offs

this is a purely numerical statement that you should be able to check and you cpa friend should be able to prove if true   the general advice i think is that you should not use your retirement funds this way but general advice does not apply equally well to everyone    you did n't give enough information for us to compute the answer so you 're on your own there   if you do this or have the cpa do it make sure that it accounts for all pluses and minuses that you 'll have   on the minus side you get any direct penalties in addition to potential loss of right to contribute for a period of time so make sure you consider both aspects especially to any degree that you would lose an employer contribution or match   also consider the fact that the money already in is tax advantaged and you wo n't be able to replace that amount later   so there will be a compounding effect to what was lost this may or may not be balanced by a mortgage interest deduction down the road my guess is that it will not but again the details of your situation may dictate a different path   the mortgage interest deduction decreases each year as you pay more principal whereas the compounding from being tax deferred tends to increase each year

generally i would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available why pay interest if you have the money that is of course if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay which can happen if you got a very low apr for your car loan but then you probably have excellent credit already and should n't care about the history of the loan on your report re the 7 years vs 2 years to the best of my knowledge its not true it will stay 7 years even if its closed during the first year

personally i buy newer luxury cars for two reasons    1 status symbol newer cars have the latest looks performance and features like heated side mirrors and sensors that adjust control speed when in heavy traffic etc    2 older cars have more wear and tear no one has spent any significant amount of time in the car before and therefore you know the history of what the car has been through like buying a new pair of pants   you know that no one has pissed in them after i have pissed in and up my now older luxury car i sell it off and get a new one   cars wear out and as they get older they need parts replaced   my brother 's mazda for example just blew the head after buying the car new and driving 130k miles over a four year period   part of the luxury for owning a new car is the luxury of time not having your car spend any significant amount of time in a garage being worked on unless you buy a land of course

if you 're sure you want to go the high risk route you could consider hot stocks or even bonds for companies countries with lower credit ratings and higher risk i think an underrated cost of investing is the tax penalties that you pay when you win if you are n't using a tax advantaged account for your speculating account you might want to open a self directed ira so that you can get access to more of the high risk options that you crave without the tax liability if any of those have a big payout you want your high growth money to be in a roth because it would be a shame to strike it rich while you 're young and then have to pay taxes on it when you 're older if you choose not to make these investments in a tax advantaged account try to hold your stocks for a year so you only get taxed at capital gains rates instead of as ordinary income if you choose to work for a startup buy your stock options as they vest so that if the company goes public or sells privately you will have owned those stocks long enough to qualify for capital gains if you want my actual advice about what i think you should do i would increase your 401k percentage to at least 10 with or without a match and keep that in low cost index funds while you 're young but moving some of those investments over to bonds as you get closer to retirement and your risk tolerance declines assuming you 're not in the 25 tax bracket all of your money should be in a roth 401k or ira because you can withdraw it without being taxed when you retire   the more money you put into those accounts now while you are young the more time it all has to grow the real risk of chasing the high risk returns is that when you bet wrong it will set you back far enough that you will lose the advantage that comes from investing the money while you 're young you 're going to have up and down years with your self selected investments why not just keep plugging money into the s&p which has its ups and downs but has always up over time

only if your work on the side is making you at least £ 60,000 profit a year the overheads are just not worth it if you make less working as a sole trader you can still claim for expenses incurred in the course of your business you can also claim a percentage of your computer costs even though you may use the computer for gaming this is not unreasonable as the computer is necessary for your work the inland revenue accept the fact that some assets are part work related in your case as a web and mobile phone developer i expect the percentage to be at least half if not a lot more if you need to travel in the course of your work you can claim a percentage for your car you can include other small expenses such as telephone electricity etc but do n't go overboard the important point to remember is that you must be able to defend the expenses claimed as work related so long as you can do this there is no problem remember to keep good records of all your expenses this is on going throughout the year and is much more work than filling out your tax return the software on the ir self assessment site is excellent so it 's conceivable that you may not need an accountant if you are prepared to do your own tax return however if you feel unsure employ an accountant initially and take it from there

the prices seem very low even considering the risk the prices are low because of the risk nothing happens to the banks if the sovereign defaults however the sovereign debt holders lose some or all the money they lent to that sovereign incidentally many banks invest in the treasury bonds of various countries especially those they 're located in they also invest in other companies that rely on the government or the currency if that dependency is too high the bank may fail if the dependency is not high or non existent the bank will survive if the bank fails yes your shares will be wiped out that 's what happens with bankrupt companies if you considering investing in banks in a country that you think may default research them and see how much investments they have that will be affected by that default

while i would be very of making any investments in greece and if i lived there might want to strongly consider a larger than average investment in international funds such as an index fund on the us uk or german exchanges having debt in greece might not be such a bad thing if only it was denominated in local currency the big issue is that right now you 'd be taking out a loan on property in greece that would be denominated in euros   if worse comes to worse and greece is kicked out of the eu and forced to go back to the drachma then you might be in a situation where the bank says this loan is in euros we want payment in the same and if the drachma is plummeting vs the euro you could find your earning power presuming you were then paid in drachma greatly diminished and since you 'd be selling the house for drachma you might be way under water in terms of the value of the house due to currency exchange vs what you owed now if greece were currently on the drachma and you were talking about a mortgage in the same i 'd say go for it   since what tends to happen when a government has way overspent is they just print more money rather than default that tends to lead to inflation and a falling currency value vs other countries   none of which is bad for someone with a debt which would be rapidly shrinking due to the effect of inflation but right now safer to rent

no because of the balance transfer fees which could be 4 unless of course you get a deal for 12 months of no payment and you pay it back in 12 months in which case a 4 annual interest rate is much less than a loan at that point you are gambling that you will be responsible with the payments and the card company is taking the opposite bet

you need a cosigner someone prepared to repay the if you should fail to needless to say this is going to have to be someone who knows you and trusts you very much one way is to find someone prepared to share a house with you buy a bigger house than you would otherwise need you would own half each and the sharing agreement would specify that if one of you defaulted on their payments the other would get a larger share according to how much extra they end up paying the other way is to find a silent partner who does n't live there they put up no money unless you actually default they would almost certainly have to be part owners but you can structure the agreement so that you end up with the whole house if you succeed in paying off the mortgage or miss no payments until you sell parents sometimes do this for their kids

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

right in that case disregard most of what i 've said that 's specific especially on the law bits check with someone local or check the court websites if small claims court is an option and if you get a judgement what options there are to collect a collection agency can also take the legwork out of that mostly at the customer expense and selling off debt is still an option the us industry for that is even bigger than in the netherlands and your loss on that is most likely tax deductible so ask yourself how much your time and is worth

you said should i make a side contract with the realtor to pay me the commission at closing i would imagine that in most if not all states that is illegal this is because selling real estate is an activity that requires passing an exam on real estate laws and obtaining a state issued license you are not bringing a buyer because you are not an agent   if you decide to go directly to the realtor that has the listing there is a possibility that the agent might agree to lowering their commission in order to make the sale however the agent is entitled to both sides of the commission because they bear all the administrative and marketing costs of the transaction   the listing agent might choose to enter into a dual agency agreement where they would have to fairly represent both sides but they can not reveal information that would be helpful to you as a buyer e.g. why the seller is choosing to sell other material facts about the property that are not public knowledge etc if there is no written dual agency agreement then the listing agent only represents the seller   in either scenario you lose the benefit of a full fiduciary relationship with an agent so if you choose to deal directly with the listing agent you are making one of the biggest purchases of your lifetime without the benefit of professional representation do you really want that put another way would you use your spouse 's attorney in a divorce so that you could save money

i think our definition of investor is different i do n't typically think of the pre school teacher who pays into union pension is an investor but they technically are which is where this disagreement stems from right the person who does n't know what the dow and s&amp;p are probably do n't need to see statements periodically although can still invest with an advisor so what develops trust other than track record clients stay with him for a long time could be an answer but why do they stay with them b c performance will a money manager who consistently loses money not get fired bc performance is a bad indicator how do people determine good vs bad job other than based on their performance of that job

not necessarily you can issue credit cards without a bank involved although companies which do so may have additional legal complications such as usury regulations as an example amex is a network which also issues cards themselves the company is not a bank they sold their banking subsidiary in 2007 it 's also possible to get a bank issued credit card without banking with that same company

i do n't know if it 's common or necessary to include capital stock as a liability yes if you look at the title of the part of the balance sheet it actually is titled liabilities and shareholders equity   your capital stock is a component of equity   this sounds like it was reported in a reasonable manner $ listed under loans from shareholders line 19 did you have a basis issue with your distributions   that is did you take shareholder distributions more than your adjusted basis that you have been taxed on   i have seen the practice of considering distributions in excess of basis as short term loans to prevent the additional taxation of the excess distribution be careful when you adjust this entry your balance sheet had to roll from one year to the next   you must have a reasonable transaction to substantiate the removal of the shareholder loan

to be confident in your solution and get the best solution for you consult a local accountant preferably one who is specialized in taxes for businesses   or muddle through the code and figure it out for yourself   the primary advantage in consulting with an accountant is that you can ask them to point out ways you can restructure your expenses debts and income in order to minimize your tax burden   they can help you run the numbers for the various options and choose the one that is right numerically

this is going to depend on the tax jurisdiction and i have no knowledge of the rules in illinois   but i 'd like to give you some direction about how to think about this    the biggest problem that you might hit is that if you collect a single check and then distribute to the tutors you may be considered their employer   as an employer you would be responsible for things like   this is not meant as an exhaustive list    even if not an employer you are still paying them   you would be responsible for issuing 1099 forms to anyone who goes above $ 600 for the year source    you would need to file for a taxpayer identification number for your organization as it is acting as a business   you need to give this number to the school so that they can issue the correct form to you   you might have to register a doing business as name   it 's conceivable that you could get away with having the school write the check to you as an individual   but if you do that it will show up as income on your taxes and you will have to deduct payments to the other tutors    if the organization already has a separate tax identity then you could use that   note that the organization will be responsible for paying income tax   it should be able to deduct payments to the tutors as well as marketing expenses etc    if the school will go for it consider structuring things with a payment to your organization for your organization duties   then you tell the school how much to pay each tutor   you would be responsible for giving the school the necessary information like name address social security number and cost or possibly hours worked
