of course you do n't have to pay them you just might not like the result as a matter of law given that i am not a lawyer i am not aware of any requirement for a company to pay employees business related expenses an example might be having a cell phone and according to this article companies are n't required to pay for you to have a cell phone even if they require you have one and use it as part of your employment the primary areas where law does exist relates to company uniforms with a logo in a very limited number of us states and necessary personal safety equipment in california and maybe only few other states all other tool requirements for a job are not prohibited by law so long as they are not illegally discriminatory such as requiring people of a certain race or sex to buy something but no one else etc so a company can require all sorts of things from having an internet connection to cell phone to laptop to specialty tools and equipment of all sorts and they are even allowed to deduct the cost of some things from your pay just so long as you still get paid minimum wage after the deductions with all that said the company 's previous payments of fees and willingness to pay a monthly internet fee does not them to pay other fees too such as moving installation etc they may even decide to no longer provide internet service at their expense and just require you to provide it as a condition of employment you can insist on it with your employer and if you do n't have an employment contract that forbids it they can fire you or possibly even deduct it from your pay anyway and this reason might not be one that allows you to collect unemployment insurance benefits but you 'd need to check with an expert on that you can refuse to pay at&t directly and they can cancel the internet service and your employer can then do the same as in the previous condition or you can choose to pay it or ask your employer to split the cost over a few checks if it is rather high and that 's about it like the cost of anything else you have to pay   from your own food to your computer clothes etc it 's best to just consider it your own cost of doing business and decide if it 's still in your interest to keep working there and for something to consider in future pay negotiations you may also qualify for an itemized employee business expense deduction from the irs but you 'll need to read the requirements carefully and get keep a receipt for such expenses

it appears so i suppose you could try saying that you do n't want to pay for it and wo n't have internet installed but that could be detrimental to your career there is no law that says your company has to pay for your internet unless you have some kind of contract with them that says you will if anything your best option might be to try to claim it is a business expense and deduct it on your taxes

debt can be denominated either in a currency the country controls or a currency the country does n't control if the debt is denominated in a currency the country controls then they have the option of printing their way out of it that option does n't come for free it will devalue their currency on the global market and hurt savers in their country but it is an option if the debt is denominated in a currency the country does not control then they do n't have that option as i understand it the us debt is in the first category it 's denominated in us dollars so the us government could if they so wished print their way out of it on the other hand greece 's debt is denominated in euros putting them at the mercy of european bankers

interesting thing is not all of this analysis is typically done by the person you are speaking with re your mortgage   likely there is an economic team at some institution or another as many many loans are sold distributed in some fashion finance team and all of them are looking at various rates etc   typically what is offered is matching an offsetting liability somewhere else   so there may be cases where the spread someone is looking to pick up might be tighter or looser within institutions or types of institutions vs others even though the overall market is at one place   e.g. banks vs. insurance companies     so you may have negotiating room at a certain term but not another or the reverse at another firm   one firm might have lots of 10 year money while another might be limited so will be picky in what they choose   either more conservative loan terms ltv or a higher spread for example   so many things go into the ultimate rate someone can get but in theory the blog did a decent job

simple   say in 2012 you were up 50 brilliant but then in 2013 you were down 50 sorry i.e. if you started with $ 1000 you were up to $ 1500 then down to $ 750 you lost $ 250 overall if you were to compute the mean of the percentages using each method then arithmetic mean the average of + 50 and -50 really 150 and 50 of each period 's initial value is zero not up or down geometric mean 1.5 .5 = .75 i.e. you are down 25 over 2 years or about 13.4 per year it should be clear the geometric makes more sense in such a case

the short answer is that banking is complicated but the bank really does n't need your money because it can get it from the fed almost free it can only use 90 of the money you give the bank it can only make money on that 90 from very low risk and thus low return investments and as it has to show a profit to its shareholders it will take whatever cut it needs to off the top of the returns all of these things combine to make savings account interest roughly .05 in the us right now the longer answer all fdic insured banks which the us requires all depositor banks to be are subject to regulation by the federal reserve the very first rule that all banks must comply with is that depositor money can not be invested in things the fed terms risky this limits banks from investing your money in things that have high returns like stocks commodities and hedges because along with the high possible returns come high risk banks typically can only invest your savings in t debt and in certain fed approved aaa bonds which have very low risk and so very little return the investment of bank assets into risky market funds was a major contributor to the financial crisis with the repeal of the glass steagall act banks had been allowed to integrate their fdic insured depositor business with their investment banking business not fdic insured while still not allowed to bet on risky investments with deposits banks were using their own money retained profits corporate equity bond money to bet heavily in the markets and were investing depositor funds in faulty aaa rated investment objects like cdos when the housing market crashed banks had to pull out of the investment market and cash in hedges like credit default swaps to cover the depositor losses which sent a wave through the rest of the market banks really ca n't even loan your money out to people who walk in like you 'd think they would and which they traditionally used to do that 's how the savings and loan crisis happened when speculators took out huge loans to invest lost the cash declared bankruptcy and left the s&ls and ultimately the fdic on the hook for depositors money   so the upshot of all this is that the bank simply wo n't give you more on your money than it is allowed to make on it   in addition there are several tools that the fed has to regulate economic activity and three big ones play a part first is the federal funds rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges on loans made to other banks which is a primary source of day to day liquidity for these banks money paid as interest to the fed is effectively removed from the economy and is a way to reduce the money supply right now the ffr is .25 that 's one quarter of one percent which is effectively zero borrow a billion dollars $ from the fed for one month and you 'll pay them a $ banks lend to other banks at a rate based on the ffr called the interbank rate usually adding some fraction of a percent so the lending bank makes money on the loan this means that the banks can get money from the fed and from other banks very cheaply which means they do n't have to offer high interest rates on savings to entice individual depositors to save their money with the bank second is quantitative easing which just means the fed buys government bonds and pays for them with new money this happens all the time remember those interest charges on bank loans to keep the money supply stable the fed must buy t debt at least in the amount of the interest being charged otherwise the money leaves the economy and is not available to circulate the fed usually buys a little more than it collects in order to gradually increase the money supply which allows the economy to grow while controlling inflation having too much money and so making money worth less than what it can buy   what 's new is that the fed is increasing the money supply by a very large amount by buying bonds far in excess of the low rates it 's charging and at fixed prices determined by the yield the fed wants to induce in the markets in the first place with the fed buying so many there are fewer for institutions and other investors to buy this increases the demand driving down yields as investors besides the fed are willing to pay a similar price and remember that t debt is one of the main things banks are allowed to invest your deposits in inflation is n't a concern right now despite the large amount of new money being injected because the current economy is so lackluster right now that the new cash is just being sat upon by corporations and being used by consumers to pay down debt instead of what the fed and government want us to do hire update equipment buy houses and american cars etc in addition the spot market price for a t bond or any investment security is generally what the last guy paid by buying treasury debt gradually at a fixed price the fed can smooth out in the spot price that speculators may try to induce by making low buy offers on t debt to increase yields lastly the fed can tell banks that they must keep a certain amount of their deposits in reserve basically by keeping them in a combination of cash in the vault and in accounts with the fed itself this has a dual purpose higher reserve rates allow a bank to weather a run more people than usual wanting their money and thus reduces risk of failure an increased reserves amount also reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy because obviously if the banks have to keep a percentage of assets in cash they ca n't invest that cash banks are currently required to keep 10 of deposited assets the sum of all checking and savings accounts but not cds in cash this compounds the other problems with banks investing not only are they not getting a great return on your savings they can only use 90 of your savings to get it

if you are able to buy a 150 k home for 50 k now that would be a good deal   however you ca n't you have to borrow 100 k in order to make this deal happen   this dramatically increases the risk of any investment and i would no longer classify it as passive income    the mortgage on a 150 k place would be about 30 year fixed   reasonably i would expect no more than in rent or   a good rule of thumb is to assume that half of rental revenue can be counted as profit before debt service   so in your case 7200 but you would have a mortgage payment of   leaving you a profit of after debt service   this is like 2 k per year   things in the financial world tend to move toward an equilibrium the benefit of rental property you can make a lot more than the numbers suggest   for example the home could increase in value and you can have fewer than expected repairs   so you have two ways to profit   rental revenue and asset appreciation however you said that you needed passive income   what happens if you have a vacancy or the tenant does not pay   what happens if you have greater than expected repairs   what happens if you get a fine from the hoa or a special assessment   not only will you have dip into your pocket to cover the payment you might also have to dip into your pocket to cover the actual event in a way this would be no different than if you borrowed 100 k to buy dividend paying stocks   if the fund company does not pay out that month you would still have to make the loan payment   where does the money come from   your pocket   at least dividend paying companies do n't collect money from their shareholders yes you can make more money but you can also lose more   leverage is a two edged sword and rental properties can be great if you are financial able to absorb the shocks that are normal with ownership

generally most businesses will not but it 's not uncommon not sure about other countries but in australia merchants here generally have to pay visa or mastercard a commission if the consumer chooses to use credit so even if they do n't levy a charge they may have a minimum purchase amount which you can use credit cards for amongst some of the ones who do include pretty much all of the budget airlines like virgin airlines   i think there 's been some outrage with them cause they charge $ 4.50 per person per trip which in some cases is greater than the transaction cost they have to pay to the credit card companies aldi supermarket link they 're kind of a budget supermarket you got to pay for shopping bags and also charge 1 more for credit card on a side note we also have a thing called here which is a debit card network i think this network charges less commission because generally a of businesses that charge for credit may not charge for i also feel is also more secure as it requires a pin number unlike a credit card which requires a signature

it would seem that the best method of bank robbery involves an inside man or woman someone in the bank who can provide information about where the largest amount of cash is and when to hit the bank $ 20,000 does not seem to be worth the risk of jail time i 'd say anything south of $ 100,000 per bank robber probably would n't be worth it and getting that amount of cash would require more than a simple walk in pull a gun empty a register robbery    the trick would either be proving an iron clad for the inside person or the group of robbers collectively contributing to the cost of that person disappearing at the very least that individual should get the largest share of the score    escape is undoubtedly the biggest issue one would need immediate transportation from the scene of the crime which could leave the area then be dumped fully for prints dna etc then the group would all go their separate ways    regardless i do n't think it 's worth the risk or the effort first off when you rob a bank the greedy bankers does n't lose the money it 's paid by the fdic which is founded by taxpayers so what you 're doing is taking money that might otherwise be spent on social services for people who need them moreover it 's expensive and time consuming to launder large amounts of money if you manage to get $ 120,000 out of a robbery which is hugely optimistic that number would take years and a significant fraction of the take just to clean for personal use and the risk of not only prison but possibly death seems rather extreme when compared to the admittedly more dull alternative of finding and holding down career    i think there are probably more efficient criminal methods of obtaining large quantities of money wealth too illegal narcotics for example are a $ 300 billion a year industry while it 's not the easiest business to get into one the potential for someone who is n't just some moron off the street to climb the cartel ladder could be significant and could lead to a high income there are significant risks of course and there 's a serious moral question as to whether selling illegal drugs is acceptable or not but if you 're morally flexible or have the opinion that illegal narcotics are not something that should be prohibited it could work    and there 's always money in the banana stand

writing a put for a stock means you are selling the right to sell you stock simply put er no pun intended writing put options means you are selling somebody else the right a contract to sell you a specific stock at a specific price before a specific date   i imagine the word write to refer to the physical act of creating a contract    the specific price is called the strike and the specific date is the expiration   by writing a put you are agreeing to purchase the stock at a particular price the strike price before the expiration   you get paid a fee the premium for agreeing to purchase the stock at the strike price if asked to   if the holder of the contract decides to make you buy the stock at the strike price you have to do it      if the stock never dips below the strike price then the holder of the put contract a contract you wrote will never exercise their right because they 'd lose money   but if the stock drops to zero you could potentially lose up to your strike price times the number of shares at stake if the holder of the contract decides to exercise    therefore writing puts is a long position meaning you stand to gain if the stock goes up   fyi long refers direction up not duration

for federal taxes the rule is fairly straight forward assuming that nothing else changes during the year   if you know your marginal tax rate the rate that your last dollar of income is taxed at last year then adding or subtracting an allowance on the w-4 form will move the amount withheld by rate x personal exemption amount the personal exemption for federal taxes in 2017 is $ 4,050 lowering the number of allowances on the federal w-4 increases the amount of money withheld during the year   so for your federal w-4 form lowering the number of allowances by one if you are in the 25 bracket will cause an additional or   a year to be withheld of course making the change of the way trough the year will mean that it will only increase the   the amount withheld the rest of the year by $ or for the rest of the year state taxes can be more complex due to issues regarding tax brackets and the differences in how they calculate their taxes most state websites have a worksheet for making an adjustment   to their version of the w-4 here is the form form for california in your situation getting the numbers on the federal and state forms will be much more complex because your combined   income for 2017 will be significantly different than your combined income for 2016   in the case of multiple incomes getting the withholding correct is much harder even with stable income the trick is that making the adjustment on the job with the highest income may not move the amount withheld as much as you expect for example if the largest income is only withheld at the 15 rate but your combined income from all your combined jobs results in you being in the 25 bracket then the above calculation would only move the amount withheld by $ instead of $ 590 a couple of notes the number of allowances on the federal and state w-4 forms do n't have to match mine almost never do the number of allowances on the w-4 forms does n't have to match the number of exemptions on the 1040 form

the short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years for independent identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally so for any number of monthly returns t setting the factor m = 12 the volatility   it should be the same for all time scales   however note the discussion here scaling volatility like this only is mathematically correct when the    underlying price model is driven by geometric brownian motion which    implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are    normally distributed particularly the comment its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such long term volatility now a demonstration   i have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3 and standard deviation = 2 so the annualised volatility should be 2 =    calculating annualised volatility for return of various lengths 3 6 12 60 months etc reveals an for shorter   the five year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure and as the commenter noted volatility is slightly overestimated when scaled over long periods of time annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths   edit re comment reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much   for instance comparing some data i have handy the dow jones industrial average capital returns cr versus net returns nr   the return differences are somewhat 0.1 each month 0.25 every third month   more erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility

incorrect as a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support the cost of entry into that marketplace increases    any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation   increased barrier to entry requires larger investment means more risk means increased difficulty finding investment   consider computer processors in the 80s creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million   today creating a processor thousands of times more complex requiring much more complex chip of which there are a mere handful and bringing it to market to compete against that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions   or you know you could look at the whole microsoft and intel locking out their competition from pc manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives leading to a de facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force pc manufacturers to deal on their terms all possible without regulation

crank out expensive shares when markets are corporations go public sell their shares for the first time in market conditions that have a lot of liquidity a lot of people buying shares and when they have to make the concessions to appease an investing public when people are greedy and looking to make money without using too much due diligence think 's ipo in 1995 or snapchat 's ipo in 2017 they also issue more shares after already being public in similar circumstances think tesla 's 1 billion dollar dilution in 2017 dilution results in the 1 share owning less of the company so in a less investing environment share prices go down in response to dilution see 's stock for an example if you can find a chart issue debt non financial companies create bonds and sell bonds why is that surprising to you cash is cash this is called corporate bonds or corporate debt you can buy apple bonds right now if you want from the same brokers that let you buy stocks mutual fund investor bernstein is making a cynical assessment of the markets which carries a lot of truth dumping shares on your mom 's 401k is a running amongst some financial professionals basically mutual fund investors are typically the least well researched or most gullible market participants to sell to influenced by brand name more than company fundamentals who will balk at the concept of reading a prospectus financial professionals and have more information than their investors and can gain extended advantages because of this just take the emotions out of it and make objective assessments

if you can still work i think a very good course of action would be to invest the majority of the money in low cost index funds for many years the reason is that you are young and have plenty of time to build a sizable retirement fund how you go about this course of action depends on your comfort level with managing your money taxes retirement accounts etc at a minimum open an investment account at any of the major firms schwab fidelity for example they will provide you with a free financial advisor ideally s he would recommend something like open a retirement account and invest as much as you can tax free or tax deferred since you already received the money tax free a roth ira seems like a no brainer pick some low fee equity funds like an s&p 500 index fund for a large chunk of the money avoid individual stocks if you are n't comfortable with them alternatively get a recommendation for a fixed fee financial planner that can help you plan for your future above all do n't spend beyond your means you have an opportunity to fund a very nice future for yourself especially if you are able to work while you are still so young

generally it goes by when they receive the check not when they cash the check though if the check was received prior to midnight on december 31st but after the bank closes they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year of course if the check is from person a to person b then the only issue is gift tax or annual limit calculations   if it is company to person then income tax could be involved   the irs calls this constructive receipt income    under the cash method include in your gross income all items of    income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year if    you receive property or services you must include their fair market    value in income example    on december 30 2011 mrs. sent you a check for interior    decorating services you provided to her you received the check on    january 2 2012 you must include the amount of the check in income    for 2012   constructive receipt    you have constructive receipt of    income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to    you without restriction you do not need to have possession of it if    you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you you    are treated as having received it when your agent received it example     interest is credited to your bank account in december 2012 you do not    withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013 you must    include it in your gross income for 2012   delaying receipt of income     you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction example    jones a service contractor was entitled to receive a $ 10,000    payment on a contract in december 2012 she was told in december that    her payment was available at her request she was not paid until    january 2013 she must include this payment in her 2012 income because    it was constructively received in 2012   checks    receipt of a valid    check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in    that year even if you can not cash or deposit the check until the    following year example dr. received a check for $ 500 on december 31 2012 from a    patient she could not deposit the check in her business account until    january 2 2013 she must include this fee in her income for 2012 in general it is best not to cut it close if the check is to be counted as an january event it is best to send it in january if it is to be december event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year

funds especially index funds are a safe way for beginning investors to get a diversified investment across a lot of the stock market they are not the perfect investment but they are better than the majority of mutual funds and you do not spend a lot of money in fees compared to the alternative buying individual stocks based on what a friend tells you or buying a hot mutual fund it 's a great choice for a lot of people if you are willing to do some study you can do better quite a bit better with common stocks as an individual investor you have some structural advantages you can take significant to you positions in small cap companies while this is not practical for large institutional investors or mutual fund managers   however you can also lose a lot of money quickly in individual stocks it pays to go slow and to your homework however and make sure that you are investing not speculating i like as a good place to start and subscribe to a couple of their newsletters i will note that investing is not for the faint of heart to do well you may need to do the opposite of what everybody else is doing buying when the market is down and selling when the market is high a few people mentioned the efficient market hypothesis there is ample evidence that the market is not efficient the existence of the .com and mortgage bubbles makes it pretty obvious that the market is often not rationally valued and a couple of hedge funds profited in the billions from this

how often should one use dollar cost averaging trivially a dollar cost averaging dca strategy must be   used at least twice more seriously dca is a discipline that people typically investors with relatively small amounts of money to invest each month or each quarter   use to avoid to the temptation to time the market   as mhoran_psprep points out it is well suited to 401k plans and the like e.g. 403b plans for educational and non profit institutions 457 plans for state employees etc and indeed is actually   the default option in such plans since a fixed amount of money gets invested each week or every   two weeks or every month depending on the payroll schedule many plans offer just a few mutual funds in which to invest though far too many people having little knowledge or understanding of   investments simply opt for the money market fund or guaranteed annuity fund in their plans   in any case all your money goes to work immediately since all mutual funds let you invest in of a share some plans allow investments in stocks through a brokerage but i think that using dca to   buy individual stocks in a retirement plan is not a good   idea at all the reasons for this are that not only must shares must be bought in whole numbers but it is generally cheaper to buy stocks in round lots   of 100 or multiples of 100 shares rather than in odd lots of say 37 shares so buying stocks weekly or biweekly or monthly in a 401k plan means paying more or having the money sit idle until enough is accumulated to buy 100 shares of a stock at which point the brokerage executes the order to buy the stock and this is really not dca at all   worse yet if you let the money accumulate but you are the one calling the shots buy 100 shares of appl today instead of letting the brokerage execute the order when there is enough money you are likely to   be timing the market instead of doing dca so are brokerages useless in retirement fund accounts   no they can be useful but they are not suitable for dca strategies involving buying stocks stick to mutual funds for dca do people use it across the board on all stock investments as indicated above using dca to buy individual stocks is not the best idea regardless of whether it is done inside a retirement plan or outside dca outside a retirement plan works best if you not trust yourself to stick with the strategy i forgot to mail the check yesterday oh well i will do it next week but rather arrange for your mutual fund company to take the money out of your checking account each week month quarter etc and invest it in whatever fund(s you have chosen most companies have such programs under names such as automatic investment program etc why not have your bank send the money to the mutual fund company instead well that works too but my bank charges me for sending the money whereas my mutual fund company does for free but ymmv dollar cost averaging generally means investing   a fixed amount of money on a periodic basis an alternative strategy if one has decided that owning 1200 shares of co is a good investment to have is to buy round lots of 100 shares of each month the amount of money invested each month varies but at the end of the year the average cost of the 1200 shares is the average of the prices on the 12 days on which the investments were made of course by the end of the year you might not think is worth holding any more this technique worked best in the   good old days when blue chip stocks   paid what was for all practical purposes a guaranteed dividend each year and people bought these stocks with the intention of passing them on to their and children

the answer provide by @mbhunter is correct however there are contexts shorting in spot market and carrying the position over settlement usually does not entail payment of dividend to the broker one of the reason being post ex date the price of the share downward adjusts to the extent of the dividend so practically if you have shorted at 100 and post ex date assuming a dividend of 2 and no movement of the stock price the price would slide to 98 the party who the stock 100 now is sitting on a price of 98 and received a dividend of 2 which equates to 100 the above is also to the law of the country governing the exchange and the security exchange board regulations

the spot curve or yield curve demonstrates the different yields at which bonds of differing maturities are being purchased when the yield curve is upward sloping longer maturity bonds are being purchased at higher yields when it 's downward sloping longer maturity bonds are purchased at lower yields keep in mind that yield is inversely related to price so that a high yield bond will be at a lower price and vice versa the spot curve can also be used to determine the forward curve this is based on the concept that an investor given two options with identical cash flows will be indifferent in what to purchase i.e. their prices should be equal    to learn more about this stay here in /r finance to learn anything about your actual question try /r personalfinance

well if they have whole food locations to ship from seems pretty easy it 's just a shift in resources whereas before you paid checkout clerks you now pay 1 clerk to watch 6 self pay stations if delivery is available you might be able to assume that the number of people coming into the store would be less and certainly the numbers of items they 're purchasing would go down so you can reallocate labor to delivering orders rather than checking out customers    granted i do n't think this type of change would be sudden but certainly over time as millennials begin to manage their own households

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

i think the problem is that you 've made a math error this child would not be costing you 300 per month it will be costing you 1400 per month   1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash but you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable so if you are indeed splitting your expenses fifty fifty you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wife 's contribution   it would make the most sense i think to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses and if any is left over save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month when you need extra clothes or have to replace something they destroyed or want to pay for extra opportunities camps educational games lessons or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses higher education first car milestone celebrations safety net when starting out of course if your family is indeed a priority you might consider making an equal investment in your family say half your income 1800 to match half her time going into the building of the family   after all the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value not just a minimum bid for expenses   and again any extra can be spent on mutual expenses saved up for future costs or left as your child 's savings for major expenses or safety net i suppose i should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution 550 per month on the face of it as that should also balance out the monthly expenses   even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs   of course in this case you might want to take into account that while she 's working hours per week now running a household is i 've heard more closely equivalent to a week plus or minus being on call for a further 100 hours a week   trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked if you 're set on income ratios and splitting costs as they are also you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs unfair you mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a more stressful job well your job may well be more stressful than her job now but it is likely to be less so than raising a child her new job   as for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay again raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time money and anxiety than your education but her pay or even share of the costs does n't seem to be balanced in response   i 'm not gon na tell you what is fair that 's for you to work out just suggesting you really think it through before deciding what would be fair or not

volume 0 does n't mean that there are no buyers and sellers it just means that there has n't been any trades done yet what you need to look for are the bids and offers for selling and buying respectively for further expiration and or it options there will almost always be a bid and an offer but it may be very wide now in case where there is 0 bid no one is willing to buy you may still have a chance if the option has some value in it for that you need your broker to try to shop it to market making firms now depending on who your broker is this may or may not be possible alternatively if you have dma direct market access to the options exchanges you can try to put in an offer of your own and wait for someone to execute against you however do not expect to be traded with unless your price is out of line with the cost however in wide markets you can try options they may give you price improvement or try to offer very close to the bid you may save yourself a penny or two and perhaps get a rebate if you are using or markets if you have dma and pass through exchange fees

your plan will work to increase your total credit capacity good for your credit score and reduce your utilization also good   as mentioned you will need to be careful to use these cards periodically or they will get closed but it will work the question is whether this will help you or not   in addition to credit capacity and utilization your credit score looks at things like these factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts   you can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age btw you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score   it probably reduces average age may reduce maximum age reduces your capacity and increases your utilization

there are broadly two kinds of pension final salary defined benefit and money purchase   the text you quote above where it talks about pension it is referring to a final salary defined benefit scheme in this type of scheme you earn a salary of £ x during your working life and you are then entitled to a proportion of £ x the proportion depends on how long you worked there as a pension these types of scheme are relatively rare now outside the public sector because the employer is liable for making enough investments into a pot to have enough money to pay everyone 's pension entitlements and when the investments do poorly the liability for the shortfall ends up on the employer 's plate you might have heard about the black hole in public sector pensions which is what this refers to the investments that the government have made to pay public sector workers pensions has not in fact been sufficient the other type of scheme is a money purchase scheme in this scheme you and/or your employer make payments into an investment pot which is locked away until you retire once you retire that pot is yours but there are restrictions on what you can do with it you can use it to purchase an annuity i will give you my £ pension pot in return for you giving me an annual income of £ y say and you can take some of it as a lump sum the onus is on you to make sure that you and/or your employer have contributed enough to make a large enough pot to give you the income you want to live on and to make a sensible decision about what to do with the pot when you retire and what to use it as income with either type of scheme you can claim this pension after you reach retirement age whether or not you are still working in some schemes you are also permitted to claim the pension earlier than retirement age if you have stopped working it will depend on the rules of the scheme what counts as retirement age depends on how old you are now and whether you are male or female as the government has been pushing this age out as people have been living longer   in addition to both schemes there is also a state pension which is a fixed non means tested weekly amount paid from government funds again you are entitled to receive this after you pass retirement age whether or not you are still working

i am guessing your comprehensive deductible is around $ 500 and a totaling of your car would net only a $ 5000 payout the expected value of the insurance is payout chance of occurrence to keep things simple lets only analyze the chance of total event what percentage of occurrence would give you an expected value of the insurance of $ 300 $ = 6 this is simplified because it ignores smaller payouts but i think it 's probably not a good value for you as a totaling event would not be a desperate situation for you you can take it on faith that the expected value of any insurance product is less than the cost otherwise the company would n't sell it   you need to decide if the insurance product is something needed by you

i love john 's answer but i just ca n't help myself from adding my 2 cents even though it 's over 5 years later i sold cars for a while in the late 90s and i mostly agree with john 's answer where i disagree though is that where i worked the salesperson did not have any authority to make a sale a sales manager was required to sign off on every sale that does n't mean that the manager had to interact with the buyer that could all be handled behind the scenes but the pricing and even much of the negotiating strategies were dictated by the sales managers some of the seasoned salespeople would estimate numbers on their own but occasionally you 'd hear the managers still chew them out with i wish you would n't have said that of course every dealership is different additional purchase advice there is a strategy that can work well for the buyer but only in scenarios where the salesperson is trying to prevent you from leaving they may start you as you are packing up or blocking your path to the door or even begging if this happens they are obviously desperate for whatever reason in this case if you came prepared with research on a good price that you are comfortable with then shoot lower and hold firm to the point of near exhaustion not so low that that they realize you 're too far they will let you leave at that point it needs to be within a reasonable amount perhaps at most 1 2 of the purchase price once you detect the salesperson is desperate you finally move up to your goal number or possibly a little lower typically the salesperson will be so happy to have gotten you to move at all that they 'll accept and if the managers are fed up too like 45 minutes after close they 'll accept too i saw this happen multiple times in a high pressure scenario i also used it once myself as a buyer if you are planning to purchase options that can be added at the dealer rather than from the factory keep them up your sleeve at first get your negotiations down to where you are a little further apart than the invoice price of the option then make your move for example suppose the option you want for $ 350 with an invoice of $ 300 get within about $ 400 of the dealer then offer to pay their price but only if they throw in the option you want this will throw them completely off guard because they did n't expect it and all of their calculations were based on without it if they say yes you effectively moved $ 100 and they moved $ 300 it 's much more likely that they 'll agree to this than taking $ 300 off the price of the car i 'm guessing the reason for this is partially due to how their accounting works with sticker price vs aftermarket price and partially psychological note this works best with new cars and make sure you only do this if it 's for items they can add after the fact even if they do n't have the part in stock it 's ok they can give you an iou but if the option requires a car change to something they do n't have on the lot it will probably just make them mad

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

one way to do these sorts of calculations is to use the spreadsheet version of irs form 1040 available here   this is provided by a private individual and is not an official irs tool but in practice it is usually accurate enough for these purposes   you may have to spend some time figuring out where to enter the info   however if you enter your self employment income on schedule c this spreadsheet will calculate the self employment tax as well as the income tax   an advantage is that it is the full 1040 so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to enter ordinary w-2 income even capital gains etc of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this but in my experience the excel 1040 is more convenient as most websites and tax prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad hoc way for purposes like tax estimation   you can do whatever works for you but i would recommend taking a look at the excel 1040   it is a surprisingly useful tool

there are a few major risks to doing something like that first you should never invest money you ca n't afford to lose an emergency fund is money you ca n't afford to lose by definition you may need to have quick access to that money if you determine that you need for example $ 3000 in emergency savings that means that you need to have at least $ 3000 at all times if you lose $ 500 then you now only have $ 2500 in emergency savings imagine what could 've happened if you had invested your emergency savings during the 2008 crash for example you could easily have been in a position where you lost both your job and a good portion of your emergency savings at the same time which is a terrible position to be in if the car breaks down you ca n't really say now 's a bad time wait until the stock market bounces back second with brokerage accounts there may be a delay before you can actually access the money or transfer it to an account that you can actually withdraw cash from or write checks against but some of this depends on the exact arrangement you have with your bank this can be a problem if you 're in a situation where you need immediate access to the money if your furnace breaks in the middle of winter you probably do n't want to wait a few days for the sale and transfer to go through before you can have it fixed third you can be forced to sell the investments at an unfavorable price because you 're not sure when you 're going to need it you 'd also likely incur trading fees and/or early withdrawal penalties when you tried to withdraw the money think about it this way if you buy a bond that matures in 5 years you 're effectively betting that you wo n't have an emergency for the next 5 years if you do you 'll have to either sell the bond or if you 're allowed to get the money back early you 'll likely forfeit a good amount of the interest you earned in the process which kind of kills the point of buying the bond in the first place edit as pointed out in the comments you may also have to pay taxes on the profits if you sell at a favorable price in the u.s. at least capital gains on stuff held for less than a year is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and stuff held longer than a year is taxed at the long term capital gains tax rate so if you hold the investment for less than a year you 're opening yourself up to the risks of short term stock fluctuations as well as potential tax penalties so if you put your emergency fund in stocks you 're essentially betting that you wo n't have an emergency that year which by definition you ca n't know the purpose of an emergency fund is just that to be an emergency fund its purpose is n't really to make money

you ca n't run a business without making $ $ $    good will and good intentions only go so far and they do not always equate to positive results capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results fail and eventually go out of business these are facts which govern how capitalism works i.e. success is rewarded failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy    so if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time increased perks etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees    however if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under cut them in the market place nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive is unreasonable and flat out childish

not really on the corporate finance side so excuse me if my explanation seems a bit   nobody wants to give away control of their company but investors are going to demand a pretty steep discount on your equity if you do n't give them some way to steer management control is valuable and to this extent voting shares should always be worth at least as much as non voting shares   if the owner still retains 51 of the company however then the voting shares provide essentially no benefit over non voting barring the founder 's sudden with this in mind there 's basically no reason to issue voting shares in the first place   on the other hand with 40 of the voting power the founder 's still have a key vote and will rarely be overturned unless a 84 of the other investors disagree this still gives them de facto control while offering equity holders some degree of security if the founders were ever to suddenly lose their mind this added security allows the voting shares to trade at a premium over non voting which in turn allows the company to raise more money from their equity issuance

if you make $ 10 in salary $ 5 in interest on savings and $ 10 in dividends your income is $ 25 not $ 10 if you have a billion dollars in well invested assets you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets that means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain it makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static in that case you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges if you have a good enough rate of return on your investment you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity taking out loan after loan making the loan payments from the loan proceeds while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow at any given time though a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt if that happens you wo n't be getting another loan and the merry go round will stop spinning it 's a bit of a ponzi scheme in a way the u.s. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the world 's reserve currency you could always get a loan against the value of the u.s. currency in the past those days may be dwindling with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future if you have savings you can spend more than you make which will put you into debt then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt and at the end of the month you will be out of debt but have less in savings you can not do this forever eventually you run out of savings if you have no savings you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make this is simple arithmetic if you have no savings but you own assets real estate securities a collection of never opened beatles vinyl records a bicycle then you could spend more than you make and be in debt but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt this depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference if you have a car and you owe $ 10 on it but you can only find a buyer willing to pay $ 8 for the car that does n't help you unless you can refinance the $ 2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount but then you 're still $ 2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it and you 've still increased your debt by spending more than you made if you stay on this path sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt plain and simple as a wrinkle in the concrete example let 's say you have stock options with your employer this is a form of a call you could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market or for a commodity in the futures market that means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price usually with an expiration date you do n't own the stock you just have the right to buy it at the call price regardless of the current market value when you buy it in the case of employee stock options your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule you have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price the stocks vest on a certain date remain employed longer and more stocks may vest depending on your contract if you quit or are terminated before that date you forfeit your options if you stick around through your vesting schedule you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price it only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price if the current market value is lower than your option price you 're better off just buying the asset at the current market value or waiting and   hoping that the value increases before your contract expires you could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your call option and then re selling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it but you may have to wait for a vesting period to before you can exercise your option depending on the nature of your contract during this waiting period you are in debt and if you ca n't service your debt i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors your things could get repossessed oh do n't forget that you 'll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option further if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock or futures options then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call but you are unable to capitalize it and you 'll lose what you already paid if you can get a loan to exercise your option but you 're a bad credit risk chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of re selling the stock or other asset in fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them and stipulating that they 'll pay you what 's left after they subtract their fee even if you can get a traditional loan you will pay interest over time the end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt finally if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option but you 'll pay transaction fees to do that and the entire action would be pure speculation or investment but not an immediate means to pay off your debt unless you have reliable insider trading information but then you risk running afoul of the law frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an investment hoping the value will increase unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt or the risk of repossession of your belongings remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours not your house not your car not your bicycle not your smartphone most of the time your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowest interest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt up to the highest total payment you can tolerate set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case as you pay off the highest interest debt shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highest interest debt until that one is paid off and repeat on down the line until you 're out of debt then live within your means so that you do n't find yourself working at mcdonald 's because you do n't have a choice when you 're in your 80 's

i believe it is so   it does n't sound like they did anything outright illegal just a pushy upsell   you can complain to the bank manager   if you want you can mention the employee by name if you know who they are   ultimately you can change banks   from what you say it sounds like you are with this bank so i think you should at least begin evaluating other banks and consider switching   you can also let your current bank know you are planning to take all your money away from them specifically because of their poor customer service you could consider filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau alleging that the bank engaged in some kind of deceptive marketing of their financial products   of course you can also file a complaint with something like the better business bureau or even just write a negative yelp review   but these actions wo n't really result in any penalty for the bank as a result of what they did in your specific case they just express your in a way that will be recorded and possibly made public e.g. in a list of complaints to protect future consumers if you 're really gung ho and have time and money to burn you could hire a lawyer and get legal advice about whether it is possible to sue the bank for fraud or misuse of your personal information   needless to say i think this would be overkill for this situation   i would just cancel the credit card tell the bank you 're switch banks and move on

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i have n't seen the movie so i wo n't try to put anything in story context   sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice    in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have   or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those this is called a naked short   in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract   with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price   you could own an orange and plan to turn your oranges into juice   or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice   or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what they 're doing here    in general people make profits by buying low and selling high   in this case they did so in reverse order   they took the risk of selling before they had a supply   then they covered their position by purchasing the supply   they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold    the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit   so they sell orange juice on the futures market   then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market   and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them    without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves   this way they can share risks with each other and financiers   combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances   without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices

gt;if the underlying economy has n't been sufficiently capitalized that will present juicy returns to investors   that is not true in an era of excessive regulation at the federal state and local levels its also not true when the machinations of government have kept interest rates artificially low for thirty years thereby causing a massive increase in household debt now we have a recession caused by the explosion of some of that debt people are wary of going into more debt and they do not have the income to spend right now in that circumstance capital investment in productive ventures is riskier than normal recovery of investment is less certain and will certainly take longer    add to that the increasing debt of the us government the debt can only grow so much before there is a shift in the economy and capital markets due to high inflation capital controls or other direct government intervention in the economy since there is exactly zero possibility of addressing the us debt with the current batch of criminals in the capitol and the white house investors are very nervous they need to be able to earn considerable profits to outweigh what they see as great risks    if on top of all that uncertainty you tell investors that if they manage to hit a home run and become profitable that the government is going to take a bigger bite out of their profits well many of them are going to say why bother i can live on my savings

no it is the same as it has always been the market gives a valuation of a company based off its expected discounted cash flow    only problem we see is that many growth companies $ tsla are being given the benefit of the doubt in regards to their expected growth and future profitability if tesla does grow as many expect then current share prices are definitely justifiable but since when do we price things based on their ideal scenario this market has lost its grip on risk reward and risk tolerance does even a tesla bull think that the company even has a chance at ever exceeding expectations in regards to near future growth or profitability and even those who are invested in the company admit there is a serious chance that tesla fails to reach expectations for growth margins   either way the market will cool soon and negative cash flow companies with ultra aggressive growth targets will be punished     if i was n't poor saving up to buy a house i 'd love to purchase 100 january 2019 $ 50 put leaps at a cost of $ 0.55 symbol tsla option put total cost $ 5,500   a tesla bk before january 18th 2019 would mean $ $ 5,500 = $ net profit wow   a reduction in market cap to $ 5 billion and increase in outstanding shares to 200 million currently at m results in a net profit of $   a reduction in market cap to $ 10 billion with the same share dilution results in share price of $ 50 and thus a full loss of my $ 5,500

it is possible for him to get a loan against the house as long as the all takes place at the same time as the loan is closing basically you and your brother will both have paperwork to sign and the title company will not send out checks until the loan funds from the mortgage company for that to take place the estate will generally have to be fully settled that can take time but you might wish to retain a lawyer to be certain your interests are completely protected many people feel like getting legal representation will strain family relationships but i find the opposite to be true they often grease the wheels and get the process finished quickly and fairly which ultimately reduces such strain i would view it as a good sign if he is paying off large debts because that means he will be in a better position to take a mortgage to pay you your share but that assumes he is acting in good faith

first of all never ask a realtor for advice the realtor represents the seller 's advice above is by far the most accurate of the previous answers the first step is to estimate the market look at past sales in the neighborhood over time and from them estimate the prospects for the house at different time durations based on other sales how fast do you think the house will sell at a given price 60 days 90 days a year if a house is high priced that means the seller is prepared to wait he is saying i am happy to wait a year to find somebody who will pay this next who is the owner young professional retiring couple landlord flipper who is it the more you know about the owner the better everybody has a time table you need to find out what that is next what is your timetable you need the house by the end of the month or by the end of the year or never which is it objectively rate the house and minuses good houses are those which everybody else hates and you love you will get the best price there assuming you need to find a house in 90 days based on these considerations determine the lowest price you think the owner will accept in a 30-day time frame make a written offer with an address and email no phone number if he comes back with a counter offer ignore it if for some reason a realtor has your number and calls you tell them my written offer speaks for itself i have nothing further to say it is very important not to entertain haggling or counter offers do n't even pick up the phone he has your written offer he can email or write you i accept   if the move onto your 2 choice and make a more aggressive offer if that does n't work go to choice 3 and accept the listed price this strategy may seem counter intuitive because the natural tendency for people is to want to communicate trust me the way to succeed in a negotiation is to not communicate make your offer and that is that that is the pro way to do it and will produce the best result for a short term long term situation if you are an investor flipper or have a lot of time to wait spend you can use a different strategy which involves pressuring the seller what you do here is find a property you want in which the owner is vulnerable that means someone who is old bankrupt out of work indicted and on their way to prison or already in prison etc bank owned properties fall into this category in this case you figure out the 6-month price or however long you are willing to work on it then you the person become their buddy visit them in prison take the bank officer to lunch show up on holidays invite them to thanksgiving start a relationship every two weeks you them want to sell yet want to sell yet you basically harass them until they maybe it takes 6 months maybe it takes 2 years eventually they will give in by this means you can get a much better deal than in strategy 1 above but it takes a lot more time and effort and is appropriate more for an investor

well it 's directly depositing money in your account but direct deposit is something completely different direct deposits are most commonly made by businesses in the payment of salaries and wages and for the payment of suppliers accounts but the facility can be used for payments for any purpose such as payment of bills taxes and other government charges direct deposits are most commonly made by means of electronic funds transfers effected using online mobile and telephone banking systems but can also be effected by the physical deposit of money into the payee 's bank account thus since the purpose of dd is to eliminate checks i 'd say no depositing cash directly into your account does not count as the requirement for one direct deposit within 90 days

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

probably the biggest driver of the increased volumes that day was a change in sentiment towards the healthcare sector as a whole that caused many healthcare companies to experience higher volumes following any spike not just sentiment related spikes the market tends to bounce back to about where it had been previously as analysts at the investment banks start to see the as being overbought or oversold this is because the effect of a spike on underlying ratios such as the sharpe ratio or the pe ratio makes the stock look less attractive to buyers and more attractive to sellers including short sellers note however that the price is broadly still a little higher than it was before the spike as a result of this change in sentiment looking at the price trends on bloomberg the price had been steadily falling for the year prior to the spike but was out at just over $ 1 in the few months immediately prior to the spike the increased interest in the sector and the stock likely added to a general change in the direction of the price trend and caused traders as opposed to investors to believe that there was a change in the price trend this will have lead to them trading the stock more heavily intraday exacerbating the spike note that there traders will include hft bots as well as human traders you question the legality of this volume increase but the simple answer is that we may never know if it was the target of traders manipulating the price or a case of insider trading what we can see is that taking animal spirits into account without any evidence of illegality there are plenty of potential reasons why the spike may have occurred spikes are common where traders perceive a change in a trend as they rush to cash in on the change before other traders can and then sell out quickly when they realise that the price is fundamentally out of sync with the firm 's underlying position you yourself say that you have been watching the stock for some time and by that fact alone it is likely that others are for the same reasons that you are otherwise you would n't be looking at it where people are looking at a stock expecting it to take off or drop you expect volatility and volatility means spikes

why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years because the rate is not the same never that i 've seen in my 30 years of following rates i 've seen the rate difference range from .25 to .75 in march 15 the average rate in my area is 30yr 3.75 15yr 3.00 for a $ 150 k loan this puts the 15yr payment at $ with the 30 at higher rate paid in 15 years at $ 1091 this $ 55 difference can be considered a flexibility premium as it offers the option to pay the actual $ in any period the money is needed elsewhere   if the rate were the same i 'd grab the 30 and since i ca n't say invest the difference i 'd say to pay at a pace to go 15 unless you had a cash flow situation a spouse out of work an emergency that you funded with a high interest rate loan etc the advice to have an emergency fund is great until for whatever reason there 's just not enough   on a personal note i did go with the 15 year mortgage for our last refinance i was nearing 50 at the time and it seemed prudent to aim for a mortgage free retirement

because people are willing to trade for it   people are willing to trade for gold because the value of gold goes up because the demand for it goes up while the supply has been basically static or growing at a low static rate for a long time   the demand is going up because people see it as a safe place to put their money    another reason gold 's value in dollars goes up is because the value of the item it 's traded against dollars euros yen etc goes down while its own value stays roughly the same you point out gold is not as liquid as cash but gold both traded on an exchange and held physically is easily sold   there is always someone willing to trade you cash for gold   compare this to some of the bank stocks during the first part of our current recession   people were not willing to give much of anything for your shares   as the annoying misleading advertisements say gold has never been worth zero

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

if you get a loan for 80 of the value of your house that 's equivalent to buying a house with a 20 down payment assuming the appraised value is what you 'd buy it for   that 's the minimum down payment for fannie mae backed loans without pmi mortgage insurance   see this table for more details freddie mac the other major mortgage has a good fact sheet on cash out loans which is what this is called here   it also specifies maximum ltv ratio of 80 percent for primary residences   as noted in other answers the 80 rule is to protect the bank and ultimately fannie mae and freddie mac who will eventually buy most of these loans so it is more likely to recoup the total value of the mortgage if they must foreclose on the house

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

there are a lot of moving parts individual premiums and annual increases have little to do with employer premiums and annual increases and vice versa   most people think of xyz insurer as a single company with a single pool of insured folks   this common knowledge is n't accurate   insurers pool their business segments separately   this means that individual small business mid size business and large business are all different operating segments from the viewpoint of the insurer     it 's possible to argue that because so many people are covered by employer plans that individual plans have a hard time accumulating the required critical mass of subscribers to keep increases reasonable    age banded rating individual coverage and small group coverage is age rated meaning every year you get older   in addition to your age increase the premium table for your plan also receives an increase   employers with 100 + eligible employees are composite rated in general meaning every employee costs the same amount   the 18 year old employee costs $ 500 per month the 64 year old costs $ 500 per month   generally the contributions an employee pays to participate in the plan are also common among all ages   this means that on a micro level increases can be more incremental because the employer is the gross premium   composite rating generally benefits older folks while age rating generally benefits younger folks employer morale incentive generally the cost to an employee covered by an employer plan is n't directly correlated to the gross premium and increases to the are n't necessarily correlated to the increases the employer receives   employers are by employee morale   it 's pretty common for employers to shoulder a disproportionate amount of an increase to keep everyone happy   employers may offset the increase by shopping some ancillary benefit like group life insurance or bundling the dental program with the medical carrier   remember employees do n't pay premiums they pay contributions and some employers are more generous than others   employers are also better at budgeting for planned increases than individuals are regulators in many of the states that are making the news because of their healthcare premium increases there simply is n't a regulator increases   california requires all individual and small group premiums to be filed with the state and increases must be justified with some sort of math and approved by a regulator   without this kind of oversight insurers have only the risk of subscriber flight to adjust plan provisions and press harder during provider contract negotiations expiring transitional reinsurance fee and funds one of the fees introduced by healthcare reform paid by insurers and self insured employers established a pot of money that individual plans could tap to cope with the new costs of the previously uninsurable folks   this fee and corresponding pot of money is set to expire and can no longer be taken in to account by underwriters increased treatment availability it 's important that as new facilities go online insurer costs will increase   if a little town gets a new cancer clinic that pool will see more cancer treatment costs simply as a result of increased treatment availability   consider that medical care inflation is running at about 4.9 annually as of the most recent cpi table the rest of the increases will result from the performance of that specific risk pool   if that risk pool had a lot of cancer diagnoses you 're looking at a big increase   if that risk pool was under priced the prior year you will see an above average increase etc

some very general advice lifestyle borrowing is almost always a bad idea you should limit your borrowing to where it is an investment decision or where it is necessary and avoid it when it is a lifestyle choice for example many people need to borrow to have a car house education or go without also if you are unemployed for a long period of time and ca n't find work charging up the credit cards seems very reasonable   however for things like entertainment travel and other nice to haves can easily become a road to crushing debt if you do n't have the cash for these types of things my suggestion is to put off the purchase until you do note i am not including credit cards that you pay off in full at the end of the month or credit used as a convenience as borrowing

i think your premise is slightly flawed every investment can add or reduce risk depending on how it 's used if your ordering above is intended to represent the probability you will lose your principal then it 's roughly right with caveats if you buy a long term government bond and interest rates increase while you 're holding it its value will decrease on the secondary markets if you need want to sell it before maturity you may not recover your principal and if you hold it you will probably be subject to erosion of value due to inflation inflation and interest rates are correlated over the short term the stock market can be very volatile and you can suffer large paper losses but over the long term decades the stock market has beaten inflation but this is true in aggregate so if you want to decrease equity risk you need to invest in a very diversified portfolio index mutual funds and hold the portfolio for a long time with a strategy like this the stock market is not that risky over time derivatives if used for their original purpose can actually reduce volatility and therefore risk by reducing both the upside and downside of your other investments for example if you sell covered calls on your equity investments you get an income stream as long as the underlying equities have a value that stays below the strike price the cost to you is that you are forced to sell the equity at the strike price if its value increases above that the person on the other side of that transaction loses the price of the call if the equity price does n't go up but gets a benefit if it does in the commodity markets southwest airlines used derivatives options to buy at a fixed price in the future on fuel to hedge against increases in fuel prices for years this way they added predictability to their cost structure and were able to beat the competition when fuel prices rose even had fuel prices dropped to zero their exposure was limited to the pre negotiated price of the fuel which they 'd already planned for on the other hand if you start doing things like selling uncovered calls you expose yourself to potentially infinite losses since there are no caps on how high the price of a stock can go so it 's not possible to say that derivatives as a class of investment are risky per se because they can be used to reduce risk i would take hedge funds as a class out of your list you ca n't generally invest in those unless you have quite a lot of money and they use strategies that vary widely many of which are quite risky

this article on the landlord website shows a simple example demonstrating that a private landlord with a mortgage could see a huge jump in their effective tax rate in this case from 18 to 67 by 2020 while a corporate landlord will see no change at all there 's also a link in that article to a detailed report which is highly critical of the tax changes the government obviously take a different view see here for more worked examples of how the tax changes will be applied more information can be found on this on various landlord sites a key phrase to look for is section 24 referring to the section of the finance no 2 act 2015 which implements the change note that this change only applies to private landlords i.e. those who own a property personally rather than through a company and who have a mortgage on the property and who after the new calculations are higher or additional rate taxpayers

i just wanted to give you a different perspective as i own a house purchased with a mortgage with my girlfriend i think it can be done safely and fairly but you do need to involve legal help to do it right there really is nothing to be terrified about the extra cost to set this up was almost irrelevant in the bigger picture of legal costs around purchasing and the documents describing the ownership scheme are quite straightforward maybe it 's a uk thing but it seems rather commonplace here   we 've chosen to hold this as tenants in common and use a trust deed for this when we purchased we had a solicitor write the trust deed and it clearly states what percentage of the house is owned by either party and exactly what the steps would be taken should we decide to end the trust e.g. in case of a split up this includes things like the right to buy out the other person before selling on the market etc   we also had to make wills separately to indicate what should happen with our percentage of the property in case one of us died as with this type of ownership it does n't automatically go to the other person   finally we 're both on the mortgage which i guess is the main difference versus your situation but again you could get legal advice as to how this should best be handled

you 're right the asset allocation is one fundamental thing you want to get right in your portfolio   i agree 110   if you really want to understand asset allocation i suggest any and all of the following three books all by the same author william j. bernstein they are excellent and yes i 've read each   from a theory perspective and being about asset allocation specifically the intelligent asset allocator is a good choice   whereas the next two books are more accessible and more complete covering topics including investor psychology history financial products you can use to implement a strategy etc   got the time read them all i finished reading his latest book the investor 's manifesto two weeks ago   here are some choice quotes from chapter 3 the nature of the portfolio that address some of the points you 've asked about   all emphasis below is mine page 74 the good news is the asset allocation    process is not really that hard   the    investor only makes two important    decisions page 76 rather younger investors should own a    higher portion of stocks because they    have the ability to apply their    regular savings to the markets at    depressed prices   more precisely    young investors possess more human capital than financial capital    that is their total future earnings    dwarf their savings and investments     from a financial perspective human    capital looks like a bond whose    coupons escalate with inflation page 78 the most important asset allocation    decision is the overall stock bind    mix start with age = bond allocation    rule of thumb i.e. because the younger you are you already have bond like income from anticipated employment earnings the older you get the less bond like income you have in your future so buy more bonds in your portfolio he also mentions adjusting that with respect to one 's risk tolerance   if you ca n't take the ups and downs of the market adjust the stock portion down up to 20 less if you can stomach the risk without a problem adjust the stock portion up up to 20 more page 86 in reference to a specific example where two assets that and are    purchased in a 50/50 split and adjusted back to targets this process called rebalancing    provides the investor with an    automatic buy low sell high bias that over the long run usually    but not always improves returns page 87 the essence of portfolio construction    is the combination of asset classes    that move in different directions at    least some of the time finally this gem on pages 88 and 89 is there a way of scientifically picking the very best future    allocation which offers the maximum    return for the minimum risk   no but    people still try       continues with description of    markowitz 's mean variance analysis    technique    it took    investment professionals quite a while    to realize that limitation of    mean variance analysis and other    black box techniques for allocating    assets i could go on quoting relevant pieces he even goes into much detail on constructing an asset allocation suitable for a large portfolio containing a variety of different stock asset classes but i suggest you read the book

actually share holder value is is better by borrowing and paying dividends is fairly irrelevant but a natural phase on a mature and stable company company finance is generally a balance between borrowing and money raised from shares it should be self evident with a little thought that if not now then in the future a company should be able to create earnings in excess of the cost of borrowing or it 's not a very valuable company to invest in in fact what 's the point of borrowing if the cost of the interest is greater than whatever wealth is being generated the important thing about this is that money raised from shares is more expensive than borrowing if a company does n't pay dividends and its share price goes up because of the increasing value of the business and in your example the company is not borrowing more because of this then the proportion of the value of the company that is based on the borrowing goes down so this means a higher and higher proportion of the finance of a company is provided by the more expensive share holders than the less expensive borrowing and thus the company is actually providing less value to share holders than it might of course if a company does n't pay a dividend and borrows more this is not true but that 's not the scenario in your question and generally mature companies with mature earnings may as well pay dividends as they are n't on a massive expansion drive in the same way now this relative expense of share holders and borrowing is more true for a mature company with stable earnings as they are less of a risk and can borrow at more favourable rates and such a company is likely to be expanding less rapidly than a small new innovative company so for both these reasons returning money to share holders and borrowing or maintaining existing lending facilities maintains a relatively more efficient financing ratio of course all this means that in theory a company should be more efficient if it has no share holders at all and borrows all of the money it needs yes in practise though lenders are n't so keen on that scenario they would rather have shareholders sharing the risk and lending a less than 100 proportion of the total of a companies finance means they are much more likely to get their money back if things go horribly wrong to take a small start up company by comparison lenders will be of lending at all and will certainly impose high rates if they do or ask for or demand security and security is only available if there is other investment besides the loan so this is why a small start up is likely to be much more heavily or exclusively funded by share holders also the start up is likely not to pay a dividend because for a start it 's probably not making any profit but even if it is and could pay a dividend in this situation borrowing is unavailable or very expensive and this is a rapidly growing business that wants to keep its hands on all the cash it can to accelerate itself once it starts making money of course a start up is on its way to making the transition it becomes able to borrow money at sensible rates it becomes bigger and more valuable on the back of the borrowing another important point is that dividend income is more stable at least for the mature companies with stable earnings of your scenario and investors like stability if all the income from a portfolio has to be generated by sales what happens when there is a market crash suddenly the investor has to pay where as with dividends the company pays at least for a while if a company 's earnings are hit by market conditions of course it 's likely the dividend will eventually be cut but short term volatility should be largely eliminated

what decision are you trying to make   are you interested day trading stocks to make it rich or are you looking at your investment options and trying to decide between an actively managed mutual fund and an etf if the former then precise statistics are hard to come by but i believe that 99 of day traders would do better investing in an etf if the latter then there are lots of studies that show that most actively managed funds do worse than index funds so with most actively managed funds you are paying higher fees for worse performance   here is a quote from the bogleheads guide to investing index funds outperform approximately 80 percent of all actively    managed funds over long periods of time they do so for one simple    reason rock bottom costs in a random market we do n't know what    future returns will be however we do know that an investor who keeps    his or her costs low will earn a higher return than one who does not    that 's the 's edge many people believe that your best option for investing is a diverse portfolio of etfs like this   this is what i do

libor plus a small spread for s&amp;p500 exposure larger spread for less more esoteric index    a swap is basically just outsourcing balance sheet to a dealer bank the counterparty dealer is shorting you the fund the return of the index to hedge their short the dealer would borrow funds and buy the stocks in the index large dealer banks can borrow at basically libor they 'll also expect compensation for the transaction costs of buying the hedge plus a profit on the small amount of capital they need to finance this transaction this will vary based on the size of the portfolio    s&amp;p500 costs maybe in transaction cost an em index costs maybe so it will depend on the index   profit to the dealer depends on supply demand dynamics sometimes this transaction will be in demand sometimes the short side will be more valuable    so it depends on the index you 're talking about as well as market dynamics right now for s&amp;p500 exposure not more than libor plus 50 for a mid sized fund

i have an espp with e*trade you can transfer stock like that via a physical paper asset transfer form look for one of those and if you ca n't find it call your brokerage or email whatever you own the shares so you can generally do what you want with them just be very careful about recording all the purchase and transfer information so that you can deal properly with the taxes

what does it mean when some one says that today there was a lot of net selling or buying in a stock what does it mean because for every selling there is also a buying going on then how can you determine a selling or buying generally if the price of stock has gone down compared to previous day the trend is of selling as the price can be volatile there maybe few trades that are above close price of previous day or below close price of previous day   how can you calculate average trade price for a stock it is simple sum of all related question equity market inflow meaning

you go public to raise money to invest in the business and/or pay off the existing shareholders it 's really as simple as that the advantage of being public is that your shares can easily be bought and sold and so you can issue and sell new ones and your existing shareholders can sell out if they want to the disadvantage is that you are much more tightly regulated with more disclosure requirements and also that you are exposed to much more pressure from your shareholders to maintain and increase your share price

changes in implied volatility are caused by many things of course and it is tough to isolate the effect you are describing but let 's try to generalize for a moment implied volatility is generally a measure of how much expect uncertainty there is about the future price of the stock   uncertainty generally is higher in periods including earnings announcements because it is significant new information about the company 's fortunes can make for significant changes in the price however you could easily have the case where the earnings are good and for some reason the market is very certain that the earnings will be good and near a certain level   in that case the price would rise but the implied volatility could well be lower because the market believes that there will be no significant new information in the earnings announcement

i think the op is getting lost in designations   sounds to me that what he wants is a financial advisor not an investment advisor   does he even have investments   does he want to be told which securities to buy    or is he wanting advice on overall savings insurance tax shelters retirement planning mortgages etc   which is a different set of skills the financial advisor skill set accountants do n't have that skill set   they know operating business reporting taxes and generally how to keep it healthy and growing   they can do personal tax returns as a favour to only the owners of the business they keep track of usually imo they can deal with the reporting but not the planning or optimization but imo the op should just read up and learn this stuff for himself   accreditation mean nothing   eg   the major planner brand teaches factually wrong stuff about rrsps which are the backbone of canadian 's finances

if you are going to the frenzy of individual stock picking like almost everyone initially i suggest you to write your plan to paper like i want an set of assets and limit single investments to 10 if with such limitations the percentage of brokerage fees rise to large you should not invest that way in the first hand   you may find better to invest in already diversified fund to skip stupid fees there are screeners like in morningstar that allow you to see overlapping items in funds but in stocks it becomes trickier and much i know you are going to the stock market frenzy even if you are saying to want to be long term or contrarian investor most investors are i.e. they follow their peers despite it would better to be a investor but as we know it can be hard   if the last part confused you fire up a spreadsheet and do a balance it is a very motivating activity really you will immediately notice things important to you not just to providers such as morningstar but alert it may take some time and bogleheads become to your rescue ready spreadsheets here

the purpose of the w-4 form is to allow you to adjust the withholding to meet your tax obligations if you have outside non wage income money from tutoring you will have to fill out the w-4 to have extra taxes withheld if you have deductions kids mortgages student loan interest then you need to adjust the form to have less tax taken out now if yo go so far that you owe too much in april then you can get hit with penalties and a requirement to file your taxes quarterly the next year most years i adjust my w-4 to reflect changes to my situation the idea is to use it to manage your withholding so that you minimize your refund without triggering the penalties the hr department has advised you well how to adjust if you want to decrease withholding making the refund smaller add one to the number on the worksheet in 2014 a change by 1 exemption is equal to a salary adjustment of   $ if this was spread over 26 paychecks that would be the same as lowering your salary by if you are in the 15 tax bracket that increases your take home pay by ~10 a check

on form line 20 you can list utilities paid for the home office you have two choices 1 you can list the entire amount under column b as an indirect expense you will then get a deduction for the fraction of the amount based on what fraction of your home is an office this makes sense if the service equally benefits your entire home 2 you can compute the portion of the expense reasonably attributable to the business office and list that amount under column a this entire amount will be deducted which option you choose depends on how well you think you can allocate the expense between your office and the rest of your home for example i have had to do this with electricity but i specifically measured the electricity used by my office if you think you can defend allocating a larger portion to the office use option 2 if you would have paid the same amount even if you did n't have an office it 's hard to justify allocating more of the expense to the office than its portion of the home if you opted for a more expensive service or otherwise incurred additional costs it makes sense to allocate a higher fraction to the office and to calculate that yourself

assuming you 're talking about a property in the united states the answer generally would be no   you are n't actually paying any of the expenses for the property and yet you want to take the deductions for doing so   that 's a rather move i 'd say grin    it probably would lead to some real strife with your brother since he would have proper claim to those credit on the basis he 's the one footing the bills for the property   before you do anything like what you 're talking about it might be best to speak with him because both of you are running the very real risk of an audit and if that happens then i can guarantee the irs will slap the out of you for it   your brother i 'm sure is already claiming all of the deductions he can for what he 's putting into the property and on top of that you want to file for your half   what half are you referring to when your out of pocket is zero   so what you 're saying is you think that between you and your brother you should be able to take a credit of 150 of the actual deductions sounds like a recipe for disaster to me i strongly encourage you to talk to a tax professional but if you get a different answer to this than what i 've already given then i 'd be stunned    i hope this helps good luck

the assumption that companies listed otc are not serious is far from the truth many companies on the otc are just starting off there because they do n't meet the requirements to be listed on the nasdaq or nyse major stock exchanges like the nasdaq and the nyse only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges the nasdaq for example has three sets of listing requirements a company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets as well as the main rules for all companies these include now do n't assume that the otc does n't have rules either as this is far from the truth as well while there are no minimum level of revenue profits or assets required to get listed on the otc there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the sec and nasd additionally there are several different levels of the otc including the the and the otc pink each with their own set of requirements for more information about what it takes to be listed on otc look here a company deciding to trade on the otc is making the decision to take their company public and they are investing to make it happen currently the fees to get listed on the otc range from $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package now i know i would n't consider $ 30 k or more to not be serious money when i looked into the process of getting a company listed on the tsx the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major u.s. markets as well consisting of an application records submission and then a decision made by a tsx committee about whether you get listed more information about the tsx here i think the way that the otc markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these get rich on penny stock companies that you see pumping up otc company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus then when they loose a bunch of money on an ill informed investment decision they blame it on the company being an otc stock   whether you decide to trade the otc market or not i would n't make a decision based on how many exchanges the company is listed on but rather based on the research you do into the company

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

context my parents overseas japan sent me a little over $ 100,000 to    cover an expensive tuition payment and moderate living expenses in    2014 they are not us residents green card holders or citizens they did not remit the tuition payment directly to the school i am a    resident for tax this is enough to answer yes that 's basically the set of requirements for filing you received > $ 100 k from a non us person and you yourself are a us person you have to report it and unless it is taxable income it is a gift taxable income is reported on the form 1040 gifts are reported on the form 3520 the fact that in japan it is not considered a gift is irrelevant gift tax laws vary between countries some many do n't have gift taxes at all but the reporting requirement is based on the us law and the us definition of gift as i said above if it is not a gift per the us law then it is taxable income and then you report all of it regardless of the amount and pay taxes had they paid directly to the institution you would n't need to count it as income gift to you because you did n't actually receive the money so no income and it went directly to cover your qualified education expenses so no gift but this is not the case in your situation whether or not this will be reported by the irs back to japan i do n't know but it was probably already reported to the authorities in japan by the banks through which the transfers went through as to whether it will trigger an audit does n't really matter it was most likely reported to the irs already by the receiving banks in the us so not reporting it on your tax return either as income or on form 3520 may indeed raise some flags

there are two totally different things there is your limited company and there is yourself   your limited company will absolutely have to pay 20 corporation tax on all its profits the profits are the income of the limited company you say it 's £ 5,000 a year minus all expenses usually you would pay yourself a salary which immediately reduces your profits and of course the payment to the accountant will reduce the profits   if the limited company is your only source of income the usual method is to pay yourself £ salary a year possible pay money into a pension for yourself which is tax free and reduces the company 's profits pay 20 corporation on the rest and pay yourself a dividend twice a year unless you have another job where you make a lot of money you should have paid all that money to yourself as income and paid zero corporation tax   and may i say that if you made £ 5,000 a year then there is most likely not enough going on to justify that an accountant charges you £ 600 you should be able to find someone doing it cheaper i can not imagine that he or she had to do a lot of work for this

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

absolutely this study should be taken into account as the study suggests there should be further study into the possible link between glyphosate and i would go as far as to say the science of just about anything moderately complex is never settled and continued research and study is always warranted and encouraged especially when it impacts our wellbeing   however i would point out that this study spends a great deal of time explaining that while an association is possible there are also many other factors that may be falsely leading them to that interpretation   in the end this paper stops far short of making a concrete link between glyphosate and any form of cancer the state of california on the other hand is making a very definitive statement that they know glyphosate causes cancer i do n't think we know this at all and the data in support of such a conclusion is extremely limited and weak at this point

10k in stock at $ 1.00 per share made those who held into the hundreds per share made millions   but think about the likelihood of you owning a $ 1 stock and holding it past $ 10.00 they millionaires were both crazy and lucky   a direct answer better off buying a lottery ticket stocks are for growing wealth not gaining wealth imho of course there are outliers though   to the point in the other answer if it was repeatable the people teaching the tricks if they worked would make much more if they followed their own advice if it worked   also if everyone tells you how good gold is to buy that just means they are selling to get out if it was that good they would be buying and not saying anything about it

you can do the roth ira but i think your income is too high to take a deduction on the traditional ira   by the way this is the 2015 tax table   you look like you are in the 28 bracket a good place to be but i 'd be putting more money pre tax in the 401(k and consider converting in years that your rate may be lower it 's easy to get married buy a house and that same income puts you in the 15 bracket   the truth is no one can project 5 years out let alone 40 and a mix like you have is as good an approach as any even if i 'd lean more pretax remember your $ match is on the pretax side so you are close to 50/50 as is

number of shares is finite yes it is i would assume that the repurchase numbers exceed the numbers of created shares number of shares repurchased by company would never exceed in theory the total number of shares it can become zero however its unlikely as it would run on its own and its not possible in practise company generally repurchase a small percentage say 5 10 of the outstanding shares the number of shares additional created is irrelevant its the total shares that is relevant edit a company starts with say 100 shares over the period it creates new shares via various mechanisms rights issue split additional shares etc say to the extent of 50 so now the company has total shares of 150 this lets say is held by 15 entities the company can buy back say 15 shares in a year and keep doing this next year another 10 etc however a company if it purchased all 150 of its own shares is unlikely as the majority shareholders will not like this to happen and loose control there are 2 different things buying out of minority shareholders typically different percentage of the shares are held by non promoters and available for trade can range from 10 to 70 there are also listing norms quite a few stock exchange need atleast 10 shares to be available for trade held by non in case a company has a small number of shares held by non promoters it can buy back the shares and the company from the exchange

i wrote about the dynamic of why either of a lower or higher exchange rate would be good for economies in would dropping the value of its currency be good for an economy a strong currency allows consumers to    import goods cheaply from the rest of    the world   a weak currency allows    producers to export goods cheaply to    the rest of the world   people are    both consumers and producers     clearly there have to be trade offs strong or weak mean relative to purchasing power parity i.e. you can buy more or less of an equivalent good with the same money governments worrying about unemployment will try and push their currencies weaker relative to others no matter the cost   there will be an inflationary impact imported inputs cost more as a currency weakens but a country running a major surplus like china can afford to subsidise these costs

if someone owns a house that is not paid off can someone buy it by taking another mortgage yes but i 'm not sure why you think the buyer would need to take another mortgage to buy it if someone sells their home for x dollars then the buyer needs x dollars to buy the house how they get that money use cash take out a mortgage is up to them during the closing process a portion of the funds generated from the sale are diverted to pay off the seller 's loan and any leftover funds after closing are pocketed by the seller what kind of offer would be most sensible i assume that in this case the current owner of the house would want to make a profit the amount that the house is sold for is determined by the market value of their home not by the size of the mortgage they have left to pay off you make the same offer whether they own their home or have a mortgage

related and one of the best titled psychology papers if money does n't make you happy then you probably are n't spending it money doesnt make you happy     the relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak which may stem in part from the way people spend it drawing on empirical research we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money specifically we suggest that consumers should 1 buy more experiences and fewer material goods 2 use their money to benefit others rather than themselves 3 buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones 4 eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance 5 delay consumption 6 consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day to day lives 7 beware of comparison shopping and 8) pay close attention to the happiness of others   even money does n't bring happiness material things do n't bring happiness things that bring happiness however are much easier to achieve with money novel bring happiness and it 's hard to afford vacations when you 're poor being useful to society at large make people happy bill gates is more useful because he is rich than a peace corps worker it 's the little things in life that make us happy and the rich can afford more of them happiness like death is by a thousand cuts

a technically strong stock or market is simply a stock or market which is up trending and has been up trending for a while just as a fundamentally strong stock is one with good fundamentals a stock that is healthy and making higher profits year after year and continually improving a technically strong stock has a healthy uptrend that continues to go up and up apple was technically strong until it hit $ 700 its price stayed above the 200 day ma for a long period until after it hit $ 700 then broke down through the 200 day ma shortly after the uptrend was over i will usually buy stocks which are both fundamentally and technically strong as a technically strong stock will generally stay technically strong longer if it also has strong and good fundamentals

short answer   any long term financial planning e.g. mortgage and retirement planning   long answer inflation does n't really matter in short time frames on any given day you might get a rent hike or a raise or the grocery store might have a sale   inflation is really only relevant over the long term   annual inflation is tiny compared to large unexpected 10   however over 10 years even your large unexpected expenses will still average out to a small fraction of your spending compared to the impact of compounded inflation inflation is really critical when you are trying to plan for retirement which you should start doing when you get your first job   when making long term projections you need to consider not only your expected nominal rate of investment return e.g. 7 but also subtract the expected rate of inflation e.g. 3 alternatively you can add the inflation rate to your projected spending being sure to compound year over year when projecting your income 10 + years out you can use inflation to estimate your annual raises   up to age 30 people tend to get raises that exceed inflation thereafter they tend to track inflation if you ever decide to buy a house you need to consider the impact of inflation when calculating the total cost over a mortgage generally you can expect your house to appreciate over 30 years in line with inflation possibly more in an urban area so a simple mortgage projection needs to account for interest inflation maintenance insurance and closing costs you could also consider inflation for things like rent and income but only over several years generally rent and income are such large amounts of money it is worth your time to research specific alternatives rather than just guessing what market rates are this year based on average inflation while it is true that rent and wages go up in line with inflation in the long run you can make a lot of money in the short run if you keep an eye on market rates every year over 10 20 years your personal rate of inflation should be very close to the average rate when you consider all your spending housing food energy clothing etc

i actually love this question and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself there some obvious touch points most people do n't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $ 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios there are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your as you get near retirement age index funds are not touted as categorically the best investment they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest there is still a management component to an index like the s&p500   the index does n't simply buy a share of apple and watch it over time   the s&p 500 is n't simply a single share of each of the 500 us companies it 's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes   voo makes a lot of trades every day to track the s&p index passive index investing is almost an oxymoron the most obvious part of this is that if index funds were the best way to invest money berkshire hathaway would be 100 invested in voo   the argument for passive index investing is simplified for public consumption   the reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under performed the large index funds net of fees   in part the of the advice is that the average person is or should be more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings   investment professionals generally want to avoid how come i my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7   if you track the index you wo n't do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night in my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $ 0 making investment decisions and $ 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold   they simply track an index xyz company is 0.07 of the index then the fund carries 0.07 of xyz even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there the argument for a majority of your funds residing in mutual funds etfs is simple when you 're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should i sell a share of amazon or a share of exxon   would n't you rather just sell 2 units of index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission   for this simplicity you give up three basis points   it seems pretty reasonable to me

without making specific recommendations it is worthwhile to point out the differing tax treatments for a roth ira investments in a roth ira will not be taxed when you withdraw them during retirement unless they change the law on that or something crazy so if you are thinking about investing in some areas with high risk and high potential reward e.g. emerging market stocks then the roth ira might be the place to do it that way if the investment works out you have more money in the account that wo n't ever be taxed we can talk about the possible risks of certain kinds of investments but this is not an appropriate forum to recommend for or against them specifically healthcare stocks are subject to political risk in the current regulatory climate brics are subject to political risks regarding the political and business climate in the relevant nations and the growth of their economies need not correspond with growth in the companies you hold in your portfolio energy stocks are subject to the world economic climate and demand for oil unless you 're talking alternative energy stocks which are subject to political risk regarding their subsidies and technological risk regarding whether or not their technologies pan out it is worth pointing out that any etf you invest in will have a prospectus and that prospectus will contain a section discussing the risks which could affect your investment read it before investing

gt;now if we convert the average income in 1965 into today 's dollars we get an average salary of $ pretty low right well today in the year 2012 the average income is somewhere around $ which means that over almost half century the average income grew by a mere 35 or only $ 11,000   in some ways it 's actually a lot worse than that   the numbers you cite are gross average income   first of all the average part is a problem since outliers greatly affect it one ought to be looking at median income   and second the fact that it is gross income before taxes rather that net income after taxes this is really critical when you look not at income taxes but rather payroll taxes and the rate changes over the years while in 1965 the payroll tax was all of total it was essentially doubled to 7.65 by 1990 and actually 15.3 if you include the employer contribution   and of course many other taxes have increased as percentages during those same years back in 1965 sales taxes were either minimal say 1 or non existent whereas now most states tax sales at somewhere between 5 and 10   but at the same time it is actually a lot better than the raw numbers make it seem   that many goods especially electronics related have continued to become cheaper even in nominal unadjusted dollars and in conjunction with that lower price much more widely available    in part that was due to continued productivity increases in farming and manufacturing and lower in real inflation adjusted terms cost of energy plus of course integrated and computers dramatically improved efficiency of operations in everything from the of cad to the mundane aspects of tracking amp controlling inventories so all hail to farmers to oil and to moore 's law else you probably would n't be able to afford a color tv much less a computer video game dvd player and many of the rest of the relatively affordable amenities including non electronic things that have been made cheaper and more widely available due to the use of computers in business amp industry that make life today more enjoyable than it was circa 1965

it does n't make a whole lot of sense to save up and wait to make a payment on any of these loans   any dollar you pay today works better than saving it and waiting months to pay it no matter which loan it will be applied to since your lender wo n't let you choose which loan your payment is being applied to do n't worry about it   just make as big a payment as you can each month and try to get the whole thing out of your life as soon as possible the result of this will be that the smaller balance loans will be paid off first and the bigger balance loans later   it is unfortunate that the higher interest rate loans will be paid later but it sounds like you do n't have a choice so it is not worth worrying about instead of thinking of it as 5 loans of different amounts think of it as one loan with a balance of $ and make payments as quickly and as often as possible for example let 's say that you have $ 1000 a month extra to throw at the loans   you would be better off paying $ 1000 each month than waiting until you have $ 4000 in the bank and paying it all at once toward one loan   how the lender divides up your payment is less significant than when the lender gets the payment

that makes no sense at all they try to compare and that 's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges mortgage is long term loan so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20 or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower something around 6 heloc will have the interest rate of 6 but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage the bottom line is if helocs were that great noone would apply for mortgages you should stick to making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage

i do n't agree with others regarding paying off debt asap you only have auto loan and auto loans are actually good for your credit score with a mere $ 6k balance it is not like you are going to have a problem paying off the loan not only that you will build your credit score and this will come in handy when you are purchasing a home   with the federal reserve setting the interest rate at 0 until 2015 i ca n't understand why people would pay off anything asap as long as you do n't have revolving credit card balances you are in the clear i do n't know your salary nor how big your is but i would save 5 months expense in cash and dump the rest in precious metals holding cash is the worst thing you could be doing unless you predict a deflation   you said you already have 40 in precious metals you are already way ahead of other 95 of   americans by protecting your purchasing power follow your gut the is coming and it 's not going to get any better

what your are talking about is price controls   the us of a has used price controls several times in the past   there was a maximum wage you could pay workers   so employers offered extra benefits such as medical and paid leave   to 1973 the nixon administration set the price of gas   this helped cause an oil shortage   we see lots of price controls in the form of rent control   not allowing rent prices to go up does n't give incentive to housing developers to build more housing   the problem with prices controls is they do n't tell consumers to stop consuming   say if there is a war and the military need all the metal it can get   by allowing the price of cars and other metal products to go up in price   the people will not buy as many cars and fix up what they have freeing up metal to be used on tanks also the metal producers will make more money from higher prices and re invest their profits to make more metal for tanks and a very few expensive cars   but if prices did not increase the people will buy cars like normal and the government will try to used up the metal on tanks   the price of metal is the same so metal producers wo n't make much extra profit as such wo n't be able to re invest in expanding their production   the biggest example of price fixing was the soviet union   but if we look just under the hood there was long lines and shortages all throughout the soviet union   as soviet planners tried to make prices correct for each product based on many number of variables such as man hours and needs   but no mathematical equation seemed to work   the gave up and used the prices out of the sears catalog for some products like shoes   if you want to good read on the subject this is a really good article

one thing i would like to clear up here is that black scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math out pops the black scholes formula black scholes gives you the real price under the assumptions of the model your definition of what a real price entails will depend on what assumptions you make with that being said black scholes is popular for pricing european options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method as dumbcoder mentioned should note that for many other types of derivative contracts e.g. american or style exercise the black scholes analytic formula is not appropriate the other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the black scholes model and they most certainly do not to use it if you look at implied for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices you may find that the implied for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the distribution assumption made by black scholes implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness of an option contract with all that being said what i 'm assuming you are interested in is either called a delta gamma approximation or more generally greek based profit and loss attribution in case you wanted to google some more about it here is an example that is relevant to your question let 's say we had the following european call contract popping this in to bs formula gives you a premium of $ delta of and gamma of let 's say you bought it and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes re evaluating with the bs formula gives whereas using a delta gamma approximation gives the actual math does n't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10 move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma

your original example is a little confusing because just shorting for 1k and buying for 1k is 100 leveraged or an leverage ratio and not allowed brokerage houses would require you to invest some capital in the trade   one example might be requiring you to hold $ 100 in the brokerage   this is where the 10:1 ratio comes from thus a return of 4.5 on the bond and no movement on the short position would net you $ 45 and voila a 45 return on your $ 100 investment a 40 to 1 leverage ratio would mean that you would only have to invest $ 25 to make this trade   something that no individual investor are allowed to do but for some reason some financial firms have been able to

defined benefit plans defined benefit plans are disappearing because of their high cost to the companies that provide them   when an employee retires the company must pay his pension for the rest of his life even longer if the pension includes a survivor option   thus the company 's financial burden grows as more employees retire    by law they must provide a fund that has sufficient resources to pay all present and future pensions   low interest rates such as we have now place a greater burden on the amount that must be in these funds    for these reasons most companies including large ones like ibm and lockheed martin have discontinued their pension plans and provide only defined contribution plans    defined contribution plans these require the company to only make contributions while the employee is working   once the employee retires the company 's responsibility ends   usually these plans employ a 401 k type savings plan for which the employee contributes and the companies matches some or all of that contribution   comparison although a fully company paid pension plan is the best it is now almost unavailable   the defined contribution plan if it includes company matching can be a viable alternative if the investments are chosen wisely and perform as expected   of course this is not guaranteed but is probably the best option that most working people have at this time

as a young investor you should know that the big secret is that profitable long term investing is boring   it is is not buying one day and selling the next and keeping very close tabs on your investments and jumping on the computer and going buy sell that makes brokers rich but not you so look at investments but not everyday and find something else that 's exciting whether it 's dirt biking or wow or competitive python coding   as a 19 year old you have a ton of time and you do n't need to swing for the fences and make 50 or 30 or even 20 returns every year to do well and you do n't have to pick the best performing stocks and if you do you don;t have to buy them at their lowest or sell them at their highest   go read a random walk 's guide to investing by burton malkiel and the only investment guide you 'll ever need by andrew buy them at used bookstores because it 's cheaper that way   and if you want more excitement read you can be   a stock market genius by joel greenblatt one up on wall street by peter lynch something by warren buffet and if you want to be really read fooled by randomness by nassim nicholas but never forget about and malkiel invest a regular amount of money every month from 19 to 65 according to what they write and you 'll be a wealthy guy by 65

at no point is it ever a good idea to stop making payments to show them you mean business when you signed up for the credit card account you agreed to pay what you charged and any applicable interested accrued on the accounts you are legally responsible for that debt and you can be sued if they are so inclined many times settlement agencies are employed because a risk assessment operator or whatever they 're called at your cc company calculated that they are currently financially better off settling for a reduced balance than attempting to chase you for the full amount as soon as the terms of your refinance hits your credit history that changes to reiterate and make it clear this is a very dangerous approach to breaking credit card debt and i would not advise that anybody proceed with it edit if you offer 50 of the balance in a lump sum payment they decline and you continue with non payment they have reason to believe that you are financially capable of making payments and are much more likely to seek legal action

india 's a very interesting case study they 're economy 's exploded and grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade it 's a free market but the reserve bank of india 's get 's weird sometimes    for instance a lot of these crappy and defaulting loans are because the government reserve bank of india said to fuel growth you have to make sure a certain percentage of your loan book is made out industries we want to develop so huge loans were made to construction firms not because they fit the risk profile of the bank or were good investments but cause the government mandated it ton 's of horribly run companies got money they should n't have   also public banks pay a lot less than their private counterparts so you do n't have the best and brightest handing out these loans    india 's a fucking mess of laws like there 's no codified way to declare bankruptcy like there is in the west so if a company goes belly up they have to go through this of different government offices with contradictory rules so creditors in many cases the banks that lent them money can get some of their money back imf said it takes 4.5 years on average for a company to go through bankruptcy proceedings that 's insane   and because it 's india there 's a ton of shady shit going on behind the scenes up until 2 3 years ago loans that the banking industry considers non performing interest payments have n't been made in 90 days were lumped in another category and hidden in the balance sheet so the rest of the world looked at this said well their ratio is only 3 4 which is fine for developing country and continued to rate them highly it was n't until recently that we figured out the entire banking sector was n't reporting their bad loans properly

the advice to invest in yourself is good advice but the stock market can be very rewarding over the long pull you have about 45 years to retirement now and that is plenty long enough that each dollar put into the market now will be many dollars then a simple way to do this might be to open a brokerage account at a reputable broker and put a grand into a very broad based all market etf and then doing nothing with it the price of the etf will go up and down with the usual market gyrations but over the decades it will grow nicely make sure the etf has low fees so that you are n't being overcharged    it 's good that you are thinking about investing at a young age a rational and consistent investment strategy will lead to wealth over the long pull

like keshlam mentioned insurance and investment should not generally be mixed term insurance is the best and cheapest insurance this would work out better than money back option you have i.e. take a term insurance for the same amount invest the difference between the premium of term insurance and money back option even if you invest this difference in bank fd 's the return is much more than what your money back policy gives pension plans are not advisable although has in recent times streamlined quite a bit of it there is still some amount that goes into commission plus the returns from annuity providers the yearly payment you get after retirement is less than what you get from fd 's i.e. currently the annuity rates are in the range of 5 6 and one year fd 's are in the range of 7 8 the only reason one need to go with pension plan or money bank plan would be if one is not financially disciplined or ca n't   reconcile to the fact that term insurance in spite of not giving any returns is much better

if you define dollar cost cost averaging as investing a specific dollar amount over a certain fixed time frame then it does not work statistically better than any other strategy for getting that money in the market   ie aunt wants to invest $ 60,000 in the stock market and does it $ 5000 a month for a year it will work better on some markets and worse on others but on average it wo n't be any better dollar cost averaging of this form is effectively a bet that gains will occur at the end of the time period rather than the beginning sometimes this bet will pay off other times it wo n't a regular investment contribution of what you can afford over an indefinite time period ie 401k contribution is not dollar cost averaging but it is an effective investment strategy

this is actually a fairly hard question to answer well as much of the currency trading that is done in financial markets is actually done directly with banks and other financial institutions instead of on a centralized market and the banks are understandably not always excited to part with information on how exactly they do their business   other methods of currency exchange have much much less volume though so it is important to understand the trading through markets as best as possible some banks do give information on how much is traded so surveys can give a reasonable indication of relative volume by currency   note the u.s. dollar   is by far the largest volume of currency traded partially because people often covert one currency to another in the markets by trading through the dollar   wikipedia has a good explanation and a nicely formatted table of information as well

or at least use the equity in the medallion to diversify borrow against the medallion to buy an income property or put it into a balanced portfolio of financial securities it looks like the same problem with real estate people are spending their capital instead of putting it to work holding most of your wealth in a single asset and then borrowing against that asset to fund consumption is a recipe for bankruptcy

i had amazon prime for 3 years   and i just stopped it at its renewal at the end of the month   i do n't own a kindle or a fire phone or a fire tv and i feel like all their services are getting geared to the people that do   android support for instant video nope   chromecast support for instant video nope they want you to buy their devices in order to take advantage of their features and i think that sucks   nothing against or fire products i 'm sure they work great   i just do n't have one or know anyone who does   so why make me buy one in order to use something i 'm paying for   that an also the increase from $ 80 to $ 100 finally did it for me    i 'm not going to lie i 'm gon na miss the free 2 day shipping but i guess i 'll just have to have order over $ 35 to place orders from now on

what i do have is this sample only stock x average price of all i purchased before = 80 total shares = 200 so if stock x 's price today is 100 how do i know how much my average price will be using your sample if you buy 100 new shares and the price is 85 for the purpose of this example your previous total cost is $ 16,000 $ 80 average cost 200 shares   with the new example you are adding $ 8500 to your total cost 100 new shares $ 85 example cost per share   that gives us a total cost of $ and 300 shares $ gives us an average cost of $ per share as long as you have the average cost and the number of shares you can calculate a new average without knowing what the price was for each transaction it may still become important to find the price information for tax purposes if you do not sell all of those shares at once and use fifo for your taxes

it is always possible for a company 's valuation in the market to be larger than the market it serves and in fact it is not uncommon   there 's valid argument that uber would be a good example of this with a market cap of more than $ 60 billion   market cap is the total value of all shares outstanding   keep in mind that what a company 's shares   trade for is less a reflection of its past or to some degree even present revenue activity and more of a speculative bet on what the company will do in the future

for easy math say you are in the 25 tax bracket a thousand deposited dollars is $ 750 out of your pocket but $ 2000 after the match   now you say you want to take the $ 750 and pay down the card if you wait a year at 20 you 'll owe $ 900 but have access to borrow a full $ 1000 at a low rate 4 or so the payment is less than $ for 5 years   so long as one is comfortable juggling their debt a bit the impact of a fully matched 401(k can not be beat keep in mind this is a different story than those who just say do n't take a 401(k loan here it 's the loan that offers you the chance to fund the account if you are let go and withdraw the money even at the 25 rate you net $ 1500 less the $ 200 penalty or $ 1300 compared to the $ 750 you are out of pocket if you do n't want to take the loan you 're still ahead so long as you are able to pay the cards over a reasonable time i 'll admit a 20 card paid over 10 + years can still trash a 100 return this is why i add the 401(k loan to the mix   the question for you is how tight is the budget and how much is the match is it dollar for dollar on first x%

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

just how much of the troubled southern eu nations debt is due to the rescuing of private banks   thanks   my answer onto related topics   in short not much while the actual sums involved in bank bailouts are considerable relative to sovereign debts run up by having structural trade deficits for ~10 years they are n't the problem in europe at the moment but they are the tip of an iceberg that could sink parts of the eu and leave the rest struggling to stay above water    an interesting question to ponder with simple answers is   if the of sovereign debt resulting from bank bailouts is so small why does the media and general public throw a fit every time a major eu bank gets into trouble   people are worried about losing their savings that they have with that bank its a visceral fear that is easy to personally relate to   but scratch below the surface and there is a whole buffet of terror for you to on   assuming leverage of on assets held by banks and that true liabilities are n't completely opaque to average joe retail investor the collapse of the right bank could fire the starting gun on a vicious recession trigger bailouts of other institutions exposed to the original and all sorts of nasty events   these bank assets include the mess created by securitization of shitty credit assets and cds commercial paper that relies on never having to be realized as a loss and interference in the money markets and by states   its damn hard to work out what assets and liabilities a bank has these days let alone what any debt they have taken on is worth    euro crisis best crisis    pulled from memory i 'm not sure if this is accurate for europe

welcome to money se your question is similar to a number of others the how do i pay my debt down and how do i invest extra money is a bit of a continuum since there 's no consensus than one should pay off the last cent of debt before investing   oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing offers a good look at this you see pete 's answer on your question is perfectly fine but since you make no mention of say a matched 401(k i 'd suggest that any answer to a question like yours should first take a step back and evaluate the bigger picture a dollar for dollar matched 401(k beats paying off even an 18 credit card   absent any tangents any thought of investing saving for anything else etc my answer is simple line up the debt highest interest rate to lowest keep in mind the post tax rate i.e. a 6 student loan you can deduct is an effective 4.5 if you are in the 25 bracket

sorry but i am absolutely correct   fractional reserve lending banking is simply that when someone deposits money into a bank the bank is allowed to loan that money out so long as they keep a reserve   if the reserve rate is 10 it 's much lower in reality and someone deposits $ 100 into the bank the bank can then loan out $ 90   that is fractional reserve lending at its most basics   now fractional reserve lending does have a multiplier effect   and this effect is exactly how i described it   let 's go back to the example   person a deposits the $ 100 the bank then loans $ 90 to person b person b spends it with person c person c takes the money and deposits back to the bank   now the bank has the $ 100 cash back $ 90 in loans and the $ 190 in deposits so they need to hold onto $ 19 as a reserve and can loan out $ 81   assuming the money cycles with 100 efficiency the bank can continue loaning out the same money until they are left with $ 1000 in deposits $ 900 in loans and the original $ 100 is the reserve   this is the multiplier effect

i was wondering what relations are between brokerage companies and exchanges are brokers representing investors to trade on exchanges yes but a broker may also buy and sell stocks for his own account this is called broker firm for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers does n't the former save the investors any costs expenses paid to the brokers yes but to trade directly on an exchange you need to register with them that costs money and only a limited number of people can register i believe note that some or all exchanges have their websites where i think trading can be done electronically such as nasdaq and bats can almost all stocks be found and traded on almost every exchange in other words is it possible that a popular stock can only be found and traded on one exchange but not found on the other exchange if needed to be more specific i am particularly interested in the u.s. case and for example apple 's stock yes it is very much possible with smaller companies big companies are usually on multiple exchanges what are your advices for choosing exchange and choosing brokerage companies what exchanges and brokerage companies do you recommend for brokerage companies a beginner can go with discount broker for sophisticated investors can opt for full service brokers usually your bank will have a brokerage firm for exchanges it depends if you are in us you should send to the us exchanges if you wish to send to other exchanges in other countries you should check with the broker about that

to get rich in a short time it 's more likely what you want to do is go into business you could go into a non investment business such as opening a restaurant or starting a tech company of course warren buffett was working in investing which is quite a bit different than just buying stocks the three ways to get rich investing i can think of are i think the maximum real after inflation return you can really count on over a lot of years is in the 5 6 range at most maybe less here 's a post where david argues 3 4 assuming cash interest is close to zero real return at that rate you can double every 10 15 years   any higher rate is probably risking much lower returns i often post this argument against that on investment questions http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ agree with you that lots of people seem to think they can make up for not saving money by picking a winning investment lots of people also use the lottery as a retirement strategy i 'm not sure this is totally irrational if for some reason someone just ca n't save but i 'm sure it will fail for almost all the people who try it

that oil is traded in usd makes for extra demand and thus a stronger dollar with more purchasing power it 's not really economics that are the issue though many might argue a weakened dollar might help the us economy cheaper exports   the real issue is power these gold backed securities make it so that certain countries can get around us sanctions   not to mention that controlling the currency that oil is traded in means the us can devalue their currency to gain an advantage in the event of a shortage   also because petroleum is traded in dollars this means treasury bonds are a natural place to store wealth for oil producers high demand for these bonds makes it cheap for the us government to borrow and easier to make interest payments thus making t bonds a safe asset

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

considering the combined accounts you 're contributing $ 100 per month and they want $ 100 per year to administer them that 's of your contributions gone to fees each year   to me that 's a definite no   without getting in to bad the adviser for even making the suggestion the scale of your account does n't warrant a fee that high fees are very meaningful to the little fish investors   there are loads of ira account providers   with that level of competition there are several that have very reasonable account minimums no annual maintenance fees and a suite of no fee no load no commission low expense ratio funds to choose from   schwab fidelity and vanguard come to mind   i know schwab is running a big ad campaign right now as it 's reduced some of it 's already low expense ratios if i were you yes i would move the account because you can even get rid of the $ account fee   but no i would not move it to a higher fee situation in my opinion on a $ 3,600 account + $ 1,200 per year in contributions you do n't need advise   you need a good broad market low fee index fund and enough discipline to understand that retirement is 25 years away so you keep contributing even when news is bad and the market is going down   in 10 years maybe talk to an adviser using the s&p500 index daily close historical data from calendar year 2016 considering first of the month monthly deposits and a starting balance of $ 3,600 you would come out at the end of the year with about $   that 's $ in gain on your total contributions of $   they 'd take $ 100 that 's about 20 of your gain   compared to a no fee account with a reasonable expense ratio of 0.1 the fee would be just $   bearing in mind also that your $ 100 per year account will probably be invested in funds that also have an expense ratio fee structure further gains   further you lose the compounding effect of the $ 100 fee over time which adds up to a significant of retirement funds considering a 25 year period   if all you did was put that $ 100 fee in to a 1 savings account each year for 25 years you 'd end up with $ considering the average 7 return of the s&p you 'd have $ on just your $ 100 per year fees this is why you should be so vigilant about fees

this questions is rational but in my view definition of savings will be like this savings is that amount of money which will be useful in unexpected future cash demanding events or they will stay ideal through out your life human can purchase pursue   any luxury items at any point of time in their life but there will come several unavoidable events which will take away your savings and some how you will not have any control over it example you found out you have a cancer at the age of 45 doctor says you can under go several treatments and will be fine again for this you will have to spend $ 1 m now this can be considered as unavoidable expense and only your savings will be helpful to you in this kind of situations so savings is nothing but a money kept at a safe location which will be used in such unavoidable situations or they will stay ideal during your entire life time and your next generation will be able to use them after your death

according to the fair credit reporting act any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to a person which it has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and    involving the extension of credit to or review or collection of an account of the consumer see section the usual interpretation of this that i 've heard is that a debt collection agency that owns or has been assigned a debt can make hard pulls on your credit report without your consent this link seems to support that and references the same part of the act among others according to the fair credit reporting act any business can access your credit history without your permission provided the business has a valid permissible purpose the fcra notes that one such permissible purpose is to review your credit information in connection with the collection of a debt thus if you owe money to a debt collector the debt collector has the legal right to pull and review your credit report if they have n't been assigned the debt or own it outright i believe you have a legal right to dispute it consult a lawyer if this is actually a situation you face   once use for this is if the debt collection agency has trouble locating you since your credit report normally contains current and past addresses this is one way to locate you

gt where are their multiple multi million dollar sexual harassment lawsuits   what makes fox bad is not how they treat women as those isolated cases are it is not the american way to blame groups of people for the crimes of individuals what makes fox bad is how they participate in the larger narrative which has effectively destroyed journalism and the culture of this country   and in that way fox and msnbc are opposing sides of the exact same coin their victim is you and people like you

the main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest only loan it 's higher risk to the bank since the principal outstanding is higher for longer   according to the new york times interest rates are usually an to a half percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans they 're also tougher to qualify for and fewer lenders offer them again due to the risk to the bank since you can always put extra towards the principal strictly speaking these are the only   downsides the upside of course is that you can make a lower payment each month the question is what are you doing with this if this is the only way you can afford the payments there 's a good chance the house is too expensive for you you 're not building equity in the home and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down if you 're using the money for other things or you have variable income it might be a different story for the former reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason if you 're cognizant of the risks for the latter salespeople on commission or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses can benefit from the flexibility

that gives their competition time to take market share   except total actual market is decreasing the pool of market share is going down so what 's happening is companies are slashing margins to even maintain market share much less increase it look at what 's happening in computers dell hp acer lenovo apple 's sales numbers dropped for as well but because they did nt drop as much as hp or lenovo their market share went up this is the new normal less than stellar sales   gt;as long as there is money on the table someone is going to reach for it markets are n't known for their patience   problem is there is less and less money on the table big companies are squeezing little companies know what you just described wal mart puts the little guy out of they 're    tax burdens cause tax avoidance they do n't touch production as long as profits are still available   yes some but you can only avoid it if you are multi national businesses with completely domestic operations can not avoid liabilities in the same way but as i said above the markets are shrinking there is less money on the table and the players that are left are fighting over the last scraps that is obviously a bit extreme but i personally deal with a lot of retailers and and there is not the wiggle room you describe i get beat up for a few dollars    i am not talking about banks or energy companies or healthcare companies i am talking about the thousands of small and medium businesses that are already squeezed these entities are the of the larger economy one or two go out of business and nobody notices but hundreds and thousands of these companies have closed now a healthy company is not made up of only wal mart exxon and apple

ignoring the complexities of a and regulated market a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party a to buy a given amount of a commodity from party b at a specified price the future can be over something tangible like pork or oil in which case there is a physical transfer of stuff or it can be over something intangible like shares the purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to lock in a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day in many cases the buyer actually wants the stuff futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example the farmer who is growing say wool will enter a contract to supply 3000 kg at $ 10 per kg of a given quality etc there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months the spot price today may be $ 11 the farmer gives up $ 1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer when the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000 kg and takes the money if he has failed to grow at least 3000 kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are for futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same say the contract is for 1000 shares of xyz stock party a agrees to sell these for $ 10 each on a given day to party b. when that day rolls around party a transfers the shares and gets the money party a may have owned the shares all along may have bought them before the settlement day or if push comes to shove must buy them on the day of settlement notwithstanding when they bought them if they paid less than $ 10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss   generally speaking you ca n't settle a futures contract with another futures contract you have to deliver up what you promised be it wool or shares

you 've already received good advice here pay off the highest rate card first in this case the best buy card i completely agree to answer your question about the minimum payment i ca n't guarantee that this is how citi does it on your particular card but several online calculators seem to use the following formula minimum payment = fees + apr 12 x balance + 1 x balance i plugged in your numbers and got really close to the minimum payment you mentioned i ran calculations for balances of and 6,500 and got payments of $ 184 and $ you can use this calculator to plug in some numbers for yourself i found the formula on this page along with a reference stating that citi uses the formula edited to add as bruce mentioned in his answer it 's probably not a good idea to just pay the minimum that calculator i linked to shows the difference between paying the minimum and even a small amount $ 50 or so more than the minimum every month something like the difference between 3 and 10 years

you 're missing the cost of carry aspect the cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity such as grain or metals over a period of time the carrying charge includes insurance storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs in interest rate futures markets it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument so in a nutshell you 'd have to store the gold safely invest your money now i.e. you 're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date   well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to london or wherever the agreed delivery place is edit forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices do n't diverge so the idea is n't that bad as i might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself i should that profits are small and is highly automated so before you spot a $ 1 profit somewhere between any two contracts you can be quite sure it 's been taken by an already

i 'm going to take a very crude view of this suppose that you have an event that would cost $ 100,000 if it occurred if there 's a 10 chance that it 'll happen to you and the insurance costs less than $ 10,000 you 'll make a profit on average this is of course assuming that you could afford a $ 100,000 loss if you ca n't the actual loss could be much higher or different for example if you could n't afford surgery because you did n't have health insurance it could be a lot more costly in a way that could be difficult to compare to the $ 100,000 obviously this is a very simplistic view of things for example making more than you paid on the premium typically is n't the only reason you 'd buy insurance even if you 're high net worth just wanted to throw this out there for what it 's worth though

this is probably a very opinion based but anyway my solution to such questions is to have multiple layers of emergency funds i have one amount in a bank account that i do not like to tap but can and do when i need money this is most close to your infrequent but not completely surprising moments of cash need i have a second layer in the form of stocks as i understand that selling stocks should not be done when you need money but when the stock price is good this provides a fairly high barrier to selling it on a whim before i do so especially if the stock price is n't at a local max it would have to be an emergency my third layer is even more fixed investment which i ca n't access with online brokerage the physical aspect makes sure that it has to be a real serious emergency before i turn that into cash if you have such a layered approach the question is not black and white anymore and easier to answer

i used to own a few investment properties so i 'm pretty familiar with this   as mrchrister mentions lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk people who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence   consequently the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down vs. as low as 3 5 down for a personal residence   with excellent credit and some shopping around you could probably do 10 down   interest rates are typically about a half percent higher as well you 'll also find that the more investment properties you have the harder it becomes to finance new ones   banks look at debt to income ratios to determine if you are over extended   typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income   however with rental properties housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income   other income you have can offset that but after buying 2 3 houses or so your dti generally into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore   this is why you 'll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages

nothing is wrong and it should be profitable but it sounds too good to be true the devil is in the details and you have not described how you found those stocks for example you may have scanned the 500 stocks in the s&p 500 and you may have found a few that exhibit that pattern over a given time window but it does n't mean that they will continue to do so in other words they may just be random outliers this is generically called a more robust test would be to use a period say 2000 2005 to find those stocks and check over a future period say 2006 2014 if the strategy you describe is profitable my guess is that it wo n't

it sorta has to do with zoning because   we decided in washington that we like have space between houses and a backyard but because of that we 're spread out and have longer commutes to work which leads to shitty traffic the only solution to fix the traffic issue i can think of is for big corporations to starting times but that might interfere with business   operations also give motorcycle riders a lane like in california

good marketing is bottom up marketing finding out what the customers want and giving it to them and not pissing them off bad marketing is top down marketing telling the customers what they will buy spying on the customers and manipulating the customers good marketing involves giving the customers a good deal this usually involves giving something for free good advertisement and something at a reasonable price along with good product and good service
