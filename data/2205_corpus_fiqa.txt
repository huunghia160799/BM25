if you 're paying a foreign person directly you submit form and you withhold the default 30 amount unless the person gives you a w8 with a valid treaty claim and tax i d if so you withhold based on the treaty rate from the irs general rule in general a person that makes a payment of u.s. source income to a    foreign person must withhold the proper amount of tax report the    payment on form and file a form by march 15 of the year    following the payment(s i 'd suggest to clarify this with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state who 's familiar with this kind of issues and not rely on free advice on the internet or diy specific cases require specific advice and while the general rule above holds in most cases in some there are exceptions

if a person is not a u.s. citizen and they live and work outside the u.s. then any income they make from a u.s. company or person for services provided does not qualify as u.s. source income according to the irs   therefore you would n't need to worry about withholding or providing tax forms for them for u.s. taxes   see the irs publication 519 u.s. tax guide for aliens

i disagree with the other respondents if your tenant is an individual renting in their individual capacity there is no reason they need your ssn they will not be sending a 1099 to you if your tenant is a business then your property is not a residential property it is at least a corporate housing and you would have noticed that the contract was signed by a company representative in the capacity of being a company representative not an individual person in that case that representative would also ask   you to fill a form w9 on which your tax id should be reported i would suggest let the tenant figure out their tax avoidance issues without you being involved

good debt and bad debt are just judgement calls   each person has their own opinion on when it is acceptable to borrow money for something and when it is not   for some it is never acceptable to borrow money for something they wo n't even borrow money to buy a house   others of course are in debt up to their eyeballs all debt costs money in interest   so when evaluating whether to borrow or not you need to ask yourself is the benefit i am getting by borrowing this money worth the cost home ownership has a lot of advantages for many these advantages coupled with the facts that home mortgages are available at extremely low interest rates and that home mortgage interest is tax deductible in the u.s. make home mortgages worth it in the eyes of many contrast that with car ownership for these reasons there are many people who consider the idea of borrowing money to purchase a car a bad idea   i have written an answer on another question which outlines a few reasons why it is better to pay cash for a car

on contrary of what mike scott suggested i think in case of euro doom it 's a lot safer if your savings were changed into another currency in advance beware that bringing your money into an euro core country like finland austria germany it 's useful if you think those banks are safer but totally useless to avoid the conversion of your saving from euro into your national currency in case of euro crash only the central bank will decide what happens to all the euro deposited wherever single banks even if they are deutsche bank or bnp or ing can not decide what to do on their own ecb european central bank might decide to convert euro into local currencies based on the account 's owner nationality therefor if you are greek and you moved your saving in a german bank the ecb might decide that your euro are converted into new even if they sit in a german bank account the thing is that if you ask to a finland bank in case of euro crash would you convert my euro into new they sure would answer no we ca n't which is true they can not because it 's only the ecb europe central bank the one that decides how an ordered euro crash has to be and the ecb might decide as i explained you above other central banks swiss fed etc would only follow the decisions of the ecb moreover in case of euro doom it 's highly probable that the euro currency looses a tremendous value compared to other currencies the loss would be huge in case the euro crash happens in a way i.e. a strong country like germany and their banks decides to get out and they start printing their own money w/o listening to the ecb anymore so even if your saving are in euro in germany they would loose so much value compared to other currencies that you will forever not to have converted them into another currency when you had the time to do it couple of advises 1 if you want to change you savings into another currency you do n't need to bring them into another bank country like us you could simply buy us shares bonds at your local bank shares bonds of a us company us gov will always be worth their value in dollars no matter in what new pathetic currency your account will be converted 2 but is there a drawback in converting my saving into another currency i.e. buying dollars in the form of us treasury bonds unfortunately yes the drawback is that in case this euro drama comes finally to an happy ending and germans decide to open their wallets for the time to save the currency the euro might suddenly increase its value compared to other currencies therefor if you changed your saving into another currency you might loose money i.e. us dollars looses value against the euro

similarly to buying property on your own reits can not get to good returns without leveraging if you buy an investment property 100 cash only chances are that 10 roi is a very very optimistic scenario if you use leveraging i.e. take out a mortgage you 're susceptible to interest rate changes reits invest in properties all around all the time they invest in mortgages themselves as well in the us that 's the only security reits can hold without being disqualified you ca n't expect all that to be cash only there have to be loans and financing involved when rates go up financing costs go up that brings net income down simple math in the us there 's an additional benefit to investing in reit vs directly holding real estate taxes reits pay dividends which have preferential if qualified taxation you 'll pay capital gains taxes on the dividends if you hold the fund long enough if you own a rental property directly your income after all the expenses is taxed at ordinary rates which would usually be higher also as you mentioned you can use them as margin and they 're much much more liquid than holding real estate directly not to mention you do n't need to deal with tenants or periods where you do n't have any or if local real estate market tanks while reits are usually quite diversified in kinds of real estate they hold and areas on the other hand if you own real estate you can leverage it at lower rates than margin with helocs etc and it provides some safety net in case of a stock market crash which reits are somewhat susceptible to you can also live in your property if needed which is something that 's hard to do with reits

i would look for these features in the credit card if there is some kind of reward option like cash back or points you obviously deduct these from the total costs chances are the total costs are higher than the rewards because generally people do n't give you money for free the reward has to be financed somehow i would against building up credit card debt it typically has a high interest rate so use the credit card only as a method of payment and pay back the debt so quickly that the interest does n't start to accumulate

i think you 're misunderstanding amazon 's business practices they are not concerned with profits and losses on a short term basis like most companies typically they re invest profits back into themselves for growth which sometimes means they do n't show a profit even though they are a profitable company however recently they have been profitable in no small part due to the growth of aws    this is fundamentally different than operating at a loss to avoid taxes in the case of the whole foods price slashing they are just doing it to hurt the competition and gain market share they also do n't need the margins to be as large as whole foods did since they are so much bigger

some questions will you need a car after 18 months   what are you going to do then how likely are you able to go over the mileage granted paying $ 300 per month seems somewhat attractive as a fixed cost   however lease are notorious for forcing people into making bad decisions   if your car is over miles or there is some slight damage even normal wear and tear or you customize your car such as window the dealer can demand extra dollars or force you to purchase the car for more than it is actually worth    the bottom line is leasing is one of the most expensive ways to own a vehicle and while you have a great income you have a poor net worth   so yes i would say it is somewhat irresponsible for you to own a vehicle if i was in your shoes i would cut my gym expenses cut my retirement contributions to the match and buy another used car   i understand you may have some over your last car but it is the best mathematical choice having said all that you have a great income and you can absorb a lot of less than efficient decisions   you will probably be okay leasing the car   i would suggest going for a longer term or cutting something to pay off the student loans earlier   this way there is some cushion between when the lease ends and the student loan ends    this way when lease turn in comes you will have some room in your budget to pay some fees as you wo n't have your student loan payment assuming around that you can then pay to the dealer

the one thing your friend needs to understand is for every dollar paid out there is somebody paying that dollar in   the mark of a ponzi scheme is that it feeds on itself the stock market has trade volumes where it almost meets the definition of a ponzi scheme   however it deals with shares in actual production facilities rather than only financial institutions and provides means of production in return for large amounts of the profits   so there is someone legitimately expecting to pay back more than he gets out in return for the availability of money at a time where he could not finance matters except by credit with your friend 's scheme there is nobody expected to pay more than he gets out nail him down with that every dollar paid out has to be paid in   who is the one paying at this point of time it sounds like there will be two possible outcomes   you 'll be visiting your friend in debtors prison or you 'll visit him in criminal prison   if you highly value your friendship you might get him out of the former with your own money   you wo n't be able with the latter   and if you let him exploit his standing for scamming his community make no mistake it will be the latter i do n't envy you

the facet of this that i find most intriguing is that our media companies are much smaller than most corporations    according to the lawsuit bpi claims that they were caused $ 5.7 billion dollars in damages it claims that they were seeing $ 650 million in annual revenue before the story   the numbers are so huge that anyone causing any disruption to such a large corporate machine is something that can not be repaid imagine if you caused that company a 1 decline in sales that 's $ 6.5 million can you pay restitution on that   our corporations are too large and their power is too great we need to break shit like this up

first the ssn is n't an issue she will need to apply for an itin together with tax filing in order to file taxes as married filing jointly anyway i think you or both of you in the joint case probably qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion if you 've been outside the us for almost the whole year in which cases both of you should have all of your income excluded anyway so i 'm not sure why you 're getting that one is better as for self employment tax i suspect that she does n't have to pay it in either case because there is a sentence in your linked page for nonresident spouse treated as a resident that says however you may still be treated as a nonresident alien for the    purpose of withholding social security and medicare tax and since self employment tax is just social security and medicare tax in another form she should n't have to pay it if treated as resident if she did n't have to pay it as nonresident from the law i believe nonresident spouse treated as a resident is described in irc which says the person is treated as a resident for the purposes of chapters 1 and 24 but self employment tax is from chapter 2 so i do n't think self employment tax is affected by this election

besides what others have mentioned another thing to watch out for is the tax withholding on withdrawal if it 's a traditional ira they will probably withhold a certain percentage on non qualified withdrawals i am not sure if you can ask them not to withhold i do n't remember the percentage and it varies by state but let 's assume it is 20 that means that you only receive 80 of the withdrawal amount when you take it out however when you deposit the money to complete the rollover you need to give them 100 of the withdrawal that means assuming the 20 withholding you need to fork out cash equal to 125 of what you received in cash within 60 days that 's like several hundred percent apr and hard to meet unless you are certain of receiving a large payment within the time period and if you forget about this and you just deposit the same amount that you received 80 of the withdrawal the remainder 20 of the withdrawal will count as an early withdrawal with all the taxes and penalty so what happens to the 20 withheld that you never received but had to pay anyway well the government has it it will count as tax paid on your tax return so it will increase your refund decrease the amount you owe but that means you are out that money until tax time unless you decrease the withholding on your salary in the rest of the year to compensate if it 's a roth ira withdrawal on the contribution there is generally no withholding so you do n't have to worry about the above but there is no penalty on withdrawal of roth ira contribution anyway

by basic public pension i assume you mean social security which is pretty much the only quasi universal pension like thing in the usa   if she has any other sort of pension e.g. from a job you 'd need to get more specific info about that as for social security as described here while you are working your earnings will reduce your benefit amount only until you reach your full retirement age according to the calculator on that site if she is 65 now her full retirement age would be 66 so if she retires after that age her ss benefit wo n't be reduced due to extra income as described here if she has considerable income apart from ss she may have to pay taxes on her ss income   this would not reduce her income but means the benefit of her extra blog income would be reduced   this page describes how to calculate your provisional income to determine whether ss benefits will be taxed   according to that page if your provisional income is less than $ 25,000 for single or head of household returns or $ for joint returns then your social security benefits will not be taxed based on the numbers you gave this suggests she would not incur an ss tax   however she should probably take a look at the social security retirement estimator and other tools on that site if she has n't already done so to get a sense of what sort of income ss will be providing her i 'd suggest that she talk to a retirement planner and/or cpa to get a handle on what her finances would be like   at the least she should find someone knowledgeable about social security policies and tax issues in the usa   as you say you are unfamiliar with the way these matters work in the usa so your ability to help her make financial decisions is limited

in some cases we when we see an opportunity to save our clients money without risking valuable coverage or diminishing benefits we make certain recommendations for more affordable life insurance one of these strategies is laddering or term lengths or term maturities the strategy is simple while most people who are considering longer terms such as 20 or 30 year term purchase a single policy to fit their needs the laddering strategy has you purchase two policies totaling the same amount of coverage you currently need but with a shorter length term mixed with the longer term for example instead of purchasing a 30 year term for $ 1 million dollars you might purchase two policies for $ 500,000 each one with a 15 year term and the other with a 30 year term the result is typically a savings of on your term life insurance just be aware that the plan going in is to let the first policy go the one with the shorter term length when its level term has expired for example in a 15 year term the premiums will be guaranteed to stay level the first 15 years and then increase every year thereafter there is typically a sizable jump in rates in that 16th year clients often see rates increase 8 10 times or more therefore it ’s important you understand that going in and realize you will most likely let that first policy go when the premiums increase leaving you with the second policy through the end of its longer level term you can crunch some numbers with our laddering calculator

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

your questions seek answers to specifics but i feel that you may need more general help there are two things i feel that you need to learn about in the general category of personal finance   your asking questions about investing but it is not as important imho as how you manage your day to day operations    for example you should first learn to budget   in personal finance often times living on a budget equates to poor or low income    that is hardly the case   a budget is a plan on how to spend money   it should be refreshed each and every month and your income should equal your expenses   you might have in your budget a $ 1200 trip into the city to see a concert hardly what a low income person should have in theirs secondly you need to be deliberate about debt management   for some they feel that having a car payment and having student loans are a necessary part of life and argue that paying them off is foolish as you can earn more from investments   others argue for zero debt   i fall in the later   using and carrying a balance on high interest ccs and having high leases or car payments are just dumb   they are also easy to wander into unless you are deliberate    third you need to prepare for emergencies   engineers still get laid off and hurt where they are unable to work   they get sued   having the proper insurance and sufficient reserves in the bank help prevent debt now you can start looking into investments    start off slow and deliberate with investing   put some in your company 401 k or open some mutual funds on the side   you can read about them and talk with advisers for free at fidelity and vanguard   read books from the library most of all do n't get caught up in too much hype   things like forex options life insurance gold silver are not investments   they are tools for sales people to make fat commissions off the ignorant       you are fortunate in that engineers are very likely to retire wealthy   they are part of the second largest demographic of first generation rich   the first is small business owners    to start out i would read millionaire next door and stop acting rich   for a debt free approach to life check out financial peace university by dave ramsey video course   his lesson on insurance is excellent    i am an engineer and my wife a project manager we found life changing and regretted not getting on board sooner   along these lines we have had some turmoil recently that became little more than an inconvenience because we were prepared

it is in the bank 's interest to sell the property for as much as they can although it is doubtful they will put as much effort time into selling it as the owner might they will certainly not sell it for $ 1 the main reason for this is that the bank would prefer to own $ 100k than a loan to them from a customer for $ 100k banks have to discount the value of loans to take into account the likelihood of the loan not being repaid they classify certain loans as riskier than others and these are discounted more heavily an unsecured home loan to a customer that has already defaulted has no collateral and now needs to pay rent and loan repayments would count as an extremely risky loan

thinking of personal residence as investment is how we got the bubble and crash in housing prices and the great recession there is no guarantee that a house will appreciate or even retain value it 's also an extremely illiquid item selling it especially if you 're seeking a profit can take a year or more housing is not guaranteed to appreciate constantly or at all tastes change and renovations rarely pay for themselves things wear out and have costs neighborhoods change in popularity without rental income and the ability to write off some of the costs as business expense it is n't clear the tax advantage closes that gap as the advantage is limited to the taxes upon your mortgage interest by deducting that from agi   if this is the flavor of speculation you want to engage in fine but i 've seen people screw themselves over this way and wind up forced to sell a house for a loss by all means hope your home will be profitable count it as part of your net wealth but generally lynch is wrong here or at best oversimplified a house can be an investment or perhaps more accurately a business or your home but unless you 're renting out the other half of a duplex which splits the difference trying to treat it as both is dangerous accounting

politics is pretty utterly fucked is n't it   haha i think that 's the one thing most sides can agree on   gt;that 's interesting and i 've heard it before is something like this writer outlines what you are thinking essentially remove corporate taxes and then tax dividends and capital gains as normal income   yeah i like the idea for a few reasons incentivizes investments in america capital is far more mobile than labor or even capital owners gets rid of of tax avoidance sticks taxation exactly where we want it in this case capital owners instead of random incidence among labor capital consumers and cuts other losses inherent in a corporate income tax   it 's really hard for me to understand why almost anyone would be against this it 's a progressive pro growth anti crony idea

i have had my card blocked at home only rarely one occasion comes to mind i had bought something fairly large online late at night no sooner had i clicked purchase than my phone the bank was asking had i actually just spent $ amount at $ online store i said yes and that was that a little later i made another purchase late at night on a different card it went through but when i tried to use the card the next day for something small in a store it was declined embarrassed i used a different card then called the bank they said they had put the card on hold because of the online purchase for a large amount even though they had let the purchase go through they had n't called me because it was late at night and they had n't given themselves any reasonable mechanisms to compensate for that like calling me the next morning emailing me or the like they 'd just blocked the card we had what you might call a frank and open exchange of views on the matter   not all banks use the same strategies or software i suggest far and away the simplest thing is just to have more than one card so that these declines are a momentary hiccup you might forget by the time you and your rolex are out of the store

i am surprised at the amount of work this contract wants done   i 'd question if it 's even legal given the high costs   i suspect it 's only there to remind abusive tenants of responsibilities they already have in law for extraordinary abuse beyond ordinary wear and tear they are already on the hook to repaint if they trash the paint think child writing on walls happens a lot and already need to and a lot more if they are a type hoarder who brings in a serious infestation happens a lot   the landlord can already go after these people for additional money beyond the deposit    but that 's not you   so do n't freak out about those clauses until you talk to the landlord and see what he 's really after   almost certainly he really wants a fit and ready to rent unit upon your departure so he does n't have to take the unit off the market for months fixing it   as long as that 's done there 's no reasonable reason for further work a decent landlord would n't require that   nor would a court imo   the trouble with living in a place for awhile is you become blind to its deficiencies   what 's more it 's rather difficult to size up a unit as ready when it 's still occupied by your stuff   a unit will look rather different when reduced to a bare room without furniture and whatnot distracting you   add to it a dose of vanity and it becomes hard to convince yourself of defects others will easily see   so tread carefully here   if push comes to shove first stop is whether it 's even legal    cities and states with heavy tenant populations tend to have much more detailed laws and as a rule they favor the tenant    right off the bat in most states the tenant is not responsible for ordinary wear and tear   in my opinion 6 years of ordinary exempt wear would justify a repaint so that should n't be on the tenant at all   as for the i 'm not in florida so i do n't know the deal maybe there 's some special environmental issue there which somehow makes that reasonable it sure would n't fly in ca   again that assumes you 're a reasonable prudent tenant not a or hoarder   as for the pro carpet cleaning that 's par for the course in any of the tough rent control areas i 've seen so that 's gotten a pass from the legislators   though $ 600 seems awfully high   other than that you can argue the terms are unconscionable too much of a raw deal to even be fair   however this will depend on the opinion of a judge hit or miss   i 'm hoping your landlord will be happy to negotiate based on the good condition of the unit which he may not know landlords rarely visit tenant units unless they really need to you certainly should make the case that you make here that the work is not really needed and it 's prohibitive   your best defense against unconscionable deals is do n't sign them   remember you did n't know the guy when you initially signed the now objectionable language should have been a big red flag back then saying this guy is epic evil run screaming even if that turned out not to be true you have hung around to find out   you may have gotten lucky this time but do n't make that mistake again   unless one of the above pans out though a deal is a deal   you gave your word   the powerful act here is to keep your word   forgive me for getting but successful people say it creates success for them   and here 's the thing you have to read your contracts because you ca n't keep your word if you do n't know what word you gave   it 's a common mistake thinking good business is trust hope faith submission or giving your all   no    in business you take the time to hammer out mutually beneficial win win agreements and you set them on paper to eliminate confusion argument and stress in the future as memories fade and conditions change   that conflict resolution is how business partners remain friends or at least professional colleagues

the mechanisms are also heavily influenced by sociopaths who are with the power that comes with wealth sadly those who have gained tremendous wealth and prosperity and want to give back by providing opportunity for others less fortunate are very much in the minority others are just selfish that believe in the of things like health care for example when they themselves benefit from having the best health care afforded to them under different terms    on another note it 's difficult to regulate free enterprise despite my observations in the preceding paragraph i actually appreciate both sides of this issue if you 've earned your money through your own blood sweat and tears who am i to tell you what to do with your money    with that said there are no simple answers i go back to those whose greed and selfish that are the real issue capitalism is n't without its flaws but when you combine it with d bag motivation you create a monopoly on wealth supported by d bag policies and practices golden parachutes compensation models corporate money in politics and many other things that are explicitly designed to preserve the wealth for the wealthy    in conclusion this really is n't about an economic model as it is about the motivations of sociopathic d bags who ca n't be bothered to think of anyone but themselves these people give a bad name to others who are wealthy and get unfairly into the stereotypes that are most commonly associated with those of great wealth and prosperity

just for clarification my perspective on education background is from a front office associate at a bb that interacts with the traders and analysts at other bb 's and hf 's daily many of whom have become good friends   take it for what you will   it 's not my role to tell you which is right for you but i can definitely give an honest perspective of which is far more common    gt there were people who passed l3 last year    does n't take into account the number of these that were already mba holders quite a larger percent as mba has become less competitive and a cfa is required to demonstrate the quantitative capacity of a mba holder   this is a huge factor in the skew of your numbers as mba 's have become dime a dozen mba holders are now being expected to hold a ms or get a cfa to establish that their quantitative skills are qualified for working on modern day wall st front office roles   gt and became charter holders   wrong   passing l3 does n't automatically make you a charterholder   you need the 48 months of approved experience in portfolio management investment analysis or market research   these roles are becoming more and more exclusive to target graduates and mba holders so the likelihood of a cfa charterholder already having a mba is actually increasing   gt now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   clearly you do n't realize the graduate enrollment levels at target schools   lets take a look at full time enrollment meaning 1/2 graduates each year for the top 10 for finance   wharton     nyu   columbia mit   stanford   harvard   uc   ucla   750 northwestern     that 's averaging graduates year per school at the top 10 schools for finance   to argue that there are no graduates from unc duke usc cornell dartmouth yale rice etc on wall st would be ignorance in its form   gt trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa    you might be a fan but clearly you do n't know much about the exam keep reading and you 'll see why   gt but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test   memorize a test   you can def argue that for l1 not for l2 or l3   there 's a reason there 's such a collective failure amongst candidates that pass 1 and move on to l2 and l3   l2 requires critical scenario understanding of the concepts more than the formulas itself   it tests your ability to understand complex and unique fra such as repatriated foreign delta 's on cash flows not just memorizing a formula and regurgitating   l3 is even more removed from just formulas as requiring detailed essay responses   3 hour section with 10 15 essay questions yeah sounds like formula memorizing /s   gt these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   this is an irrelevant point   there are plenty of top 10 and top 25 mba program grad 's that would n't pass the cfa either   both emphasize different skillsets   front office wall st is becoming more and more geared towards ms holders and cfa charters many mba 's holders and mba programs lack the quantitative focus to take these roles and are being denied   gt;one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category   absolutely   that reinforces my entire point that mba 's are dime a dozen   what are we arguing about again   mba 's are very different than a cfa in that even within target schools they each emphasize on entirely different skills   mit finance mba grads are far more likely to possess strong quantitative than say a harvard mba   the reason is that the cfa is a standard qualification that focuses entirely on quantitative capacity it is like a ms in the sense that its a mile deep and a foot wide whereas mba 's are a foot deep and a mile wide   gt everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one   you 're right   but a cfa is n't meant to be comparable and interchangeable with a wharton degree   the cfa 's closest comparison is a ms in quantitative computational finance   so if you 're trying to say cfa is less valuable than a mba it 's apples and oranges   you never will see a job require a mba or cfa the cfa will always be listed on a job role as preferred ms cfa   try comparing cfa against a ms from columbia or carnegie mellon grad and you might have valid results

to be clear a 401 k is a vehicle you make investments within it if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next enron you can still get hurt badly   so it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age tolerance for risk etc that said as vehicles go it is outstanding and the always max your 401 k is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals cfa 's pundits etc   that said there are a few priorities to consider here first priority if there is some level of company matching grab that it 's hard to beat that kind of return in almost any other case second since you never want to tap into a 401 k if you can at all avoid it before you are ready to retire you should first be sure you have a good emergency fund set aside in the event you lose your job or some other major happens   many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses    third if you have any high interest debt like credit card debt pay that stuff down as fast as you can   you 'll save a ton of interest it 's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying with zero risk ca n't be beat   you 'll also end up with a lot better cash flow and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings so you earn interest instead of paying it once you have those things out of the way then it is time to think about fully funding the   401k.   and keep in mind since you do n't pay taxes on it the felt effect to you pocket is about 80 or even less of what goes into the account so it 's not as painful as you might think and the hit to your take home may be less than you 'd expect   contributing as much as you can as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement   so if you can afford to max it out i surely would advise you to do so

like others have already said it may cause an immediate dip due to a large and sudden move in shares for that particular stock however if there is nothing else affecting the company 's financials and investors perceive no other risks it will probably bounce back a bit but not back to the full value before the shares were issued why whenever a company issues more stock the new shares dilute the value of the current shares outstanding simply because there are now more shares of that stock trading on the market the earnings per share eps ratio will drop since the same profit and company value has to be spread across more shares example   if a company is valued at $ 100 dollars and they have 25 shares outstanding then the eps ratio equates to $ 4 per share = 4   if the company then issues more shares stock to employees who sell or keep them let 's say 25 more shares then shares outstanding increase to 50 but the company 's value still remains at $ 100 dollars eps now equates to $ 2 per share = 2 now sometimes when shareholders especially employees and especially employees who just received them suddenly all sell their shares this causes a micro panic in the market because investors believe the employees know something bad about the company that they do n't other common shareholders then want to dump their holdings for fear of impending collapse in the company this could cause the share price to dip a bit below the new diluted value but again if no real immediate risks exist the price should go back up to the new diluted value example 2 if eps was at $ 4 before issuing more stock and then dropped to $ 2 after issuing new stock the micro panic may cause the eps to drop below $ 2 and then soon rebound back to $ 2 or more when investors realize no actual risk exists after the dilution phase plays out the eps could actually even go above the pre issuing value of $ 4 because investors may believe that since more stock was issued due to good profits more profits may ensue hope that helps

there are two possible scenarios relating to slightly different definitions of pension the most normal definition of pension is that you are paid a defined amount each week or month by some company or the government if so that is not part of the estate you wo n't be able to take it as a lump sum probably it is n't affected by whatever your husband wrote in his will if on the other hand you and your husband had a big sum of money which you were drawing on to pay your expenses and still are then the big sum of money would have been part of the estate the right person to ask about this is the lawyer who dealt with your husband 's will none of this is any help in deciding what you should do with the pension

you have a few correlated questions here   yes you can there are only a few investment strategies that require a minimum contribution and those are n't ones that would get a blanket recommendation anyway investing in bonds or stocks is perfectly possible with limited funds you 're never too young to start the power of interest means that the more time you give your money to grow the larger your eventual gains will be provided your investment is beating inflation if your financial situation allows it it makes sense to invest money you do n't need immediately which brings us to this is the one you have to look at most you 're young but have a nice chunk of cash in a savings account that money wo n't grow much and you could be losing purchasing power to inflation but on the other hand that money also is n't at risk while there are dozens of investment the two main ones to look at are bonds these are fixed income which means they 're fairly safe but the downside is that you need to lock up your money for a long time to get a better interest rate than a savings account index funds that track the market these are basically another form of stock where each share represents fractions of shares of other companies that are tracked on an index such as the s&p 500 or nasdaq these are much riskier and more volatile which is why you should look at this as a long term investment as well because given enough time these are expected to trend upwards look into index funds further to understand why but this is n't so much about what you should invest in but more about the fact that an investment almost by definition means putting money away for a long period of time so the real question remains how much can you afford to put away for that you need to look at your individual situation and your plans for the future do you need that money to pay for expenses in the coming years do you want to save it up for college do you want to invest and leave it untouched to inspire you to keep saving do you want to save for retirement i 'm not sure if you can start saving via iras and the like at your age but it 's worth looking into or do you want to spend it on a dream holiday or a car there are arguments to be made for every one of those   most people will tell you to keep such a low sum in a savings account as an emergency fund but that also depends on whether you have a safety net i.e. parents and how reliable they are most people will also tell you that your long term money should be in the stock market in the form of a balanced portfolio of index funds but i wo n't tell you what to do since you need to look at your own options and decide for yourself what makes sense for you you 're off to a great start if you 're thinking about this at your age and i 'd encourage you to take that interest further and look into educating yourself on the investments options and funds that are available to you and decide on a financial plan involving your parents in that is sensible not in the least because your post high school plans will be the most important variable in said plan to my first point and answer your main question if you 've decided that you want to invest and you 've established a specific budget the size of that investment budget should not factor into what you invest it in 1 for the record penny stocks are not an investment they 're an expensive form of gambling

in the end this is really not a finance question it 's about changing one 's habits one step removed however since you are helping a friend and not seeking advice for yourself   i 've learned a simple cause effect question does someone who wants goal here do this current bad habit for example someone with weight to lose is about to grab the chips to sit and watch tv they should quickly ask themselves does a healthy person sit in front of the tv eating chips   the friend needs to make a connection between the expense he 'd like to save up for and his current actions there 's a conscious decision in making the takeout purchase he 'd rather spend the money on that meal than to save .5 or whatever percent of the trip 's cost    if he is clueless in the kitchen that opens another discussion one in which i 'd remark that on the short list of things parents should teach their kids cooking is up there my wife is clueless in the kitchen i taught our daughter how to be comfortable enough to make her own meals when she wants or when she 's off on her own if this is truly your friend 's issue you might need to be a cooking spirit guide to be successful

if the government prints money recklessly and causes inflation people will come to expect inflation and the value of the currency will plummet and you 'll end up like zimbabwe where a trillion dollars wo n't buy a loaf of bread   if the government actually pays people for the money they borrow they do n't have this problem and as it turns out the us government can get pretty good rates on borrowing in general in part because they 're extraordinarily good about paying them back also inflation expectations are low so people will accept 1 2 interest rates if you expected inflation of 10 you 'd see people demanding something more like 12 interest rates the downside of too much of this sort of borrowing is that it crowds out other borrowing which may harm the economy who would lend money to invest in a small business if the government is paying good money and there 's almost no risk at all now inflation can come into play afterward if the fed decides it needs to maintain easy money policies to stimulate the economy because taxes are too high because we 're paying off the debt or because we 've crowded out smaller borrowers or something in general you can count on the the principle that if you as the government try to play too many games with people 's money well people are n't stupid they will eventually catch on and adjust their behavior to compensate and then you 're right back where you started but with less trust

you can ask your employer for anything that you want however most employers if they are contributing their own money into your hsa or you are contributing to your own hsa through payroll deduction only work with one hsa which is much easier for them to manage you are free to decline their hsa if you want   however if they are kicking in free money into your hsa i do n't recommend that you decline it   just pick the best option you have for investing as for the money that you are contributing if you do n't want to put your own money into your employer 's aetna hsa you can open up an hsa with any institution you like   you can even do this and still keep aetna hsa to take advantage of the employer 's contributions   however your annual limit is still the total of all contributions to all hsa 's in your name whether you make them or your employer makes them when deciding whether or not to use payroll deduction into the aetna hsa or to go your own way keep in mind that payroll deduction skips some payroll taxes

how you check if a broker is legitimate 1 are they a registered broker dealer broker dealers have to be registered with finra and the sec which have their own databases for you to look up individuals and companies here is finra 's finra is a self regulatory agency the sec is a federal government agency all things considered they pretty much have similar legislative authority over the industry but that s a different story if the broker is n't able to produce information that would confirm their registration status or if you ca n't readily find it in the regulators database then that is a major red flag the biggest red flag of them all 2 if brokers are also acting as a consumer bank such as how merrill lynch is now part of bank of america and the accounts can be linked pretty easily then they should will also be regulated by the fdic this means that you will be able to find the capital ratio that the company has letting you know how stable it is as an institution physical locations the name and duration of existence or their rating on bbb have nothing to do with it

it depends on your bank and the details in the agreement but typically interest is calculated daily so if you borrow 1000 eur for 1 day you pay 15 1000 eur = 42 cent cent to be exact you can simply multiply these 42 cent up with the number of days you plan and the number of 1000s eur note that weekend days count too even if you can not pay them back on the weekend the exact value will be very slightly different as the interest is added monthly to the principal and there is compound interest on the interest banks also often consider all months 30 days long for interest calculations

this is lan investment analyst at betterment to answer your question american investors are drawn to use the s&p 500 spy as a benchmark to measure the performance of betterment portfolios particularly because it ’s familiar and it ’s the index always reported in the news however going all in to invest in spy is not a good investment strategy and even using it to compare your own diversified investments is misleading we outline some of the pitfalls of this approach in this article why the s&p 500 is a bad benchmark an algo advisor service like betterment is a preferable approach and provides a number of advantages over simply investing in etfs spy or others like voo or ivv that track the s&p 500   so why invest with betterment rather than in the s&p 500 let ’s first look at the issue of diversification spy only exposes investors to stocks in the u.s. large cap market this may feel acceptable because of home bias which is the tendency to invest disproportionately in domestic equities relative to foreign equities regardless of their home country   however investing in one geography and one asset class is riskier than global diversification because inflation risk exchange rate risk and interest rate risk will likely affect all u.s. stocks to a similar degree in the event of a u.s. downturn in contrast a well diversified portfolio invests in a balance between bonds and stocks and the ratio of bonds to stocks is dependent upon the investment horizon as well as the individual 's goals   by constructing a portfolio from stock and bond etfs across the world betterment reduces your portfolio ’s sensitivity to swings and the diversification goes beyond mere asset class and geography for example betterment ’s basket of bond etfs have varying durations e.g. short term treasuries have an effective duration of less than six months vs. u.s. corporate bonds which have an effective duration of just more than 8 years and credit quality the level of diversification further helps you manage risk   dan betterment ’s director of behavioral finance and investing examined the increase in returns by moving from a u.s only portfolio to a globally diversified portfolio on a risk adjusted basis the betterment portfolio has historically outperformed a simple diy investor portfolio by as much as 1.8 per year attributed solely to diversification    now let ’s assume that the investor at hand investor a is a sophisticated investor who understands the importance of diversification additionally let ’s assume that he understands the optimal allocation for his age risk appetite and investment horizon investor a will still benefit from investing with betterment   automating his portfolio management with betterment helps to insulate investor a from the or the tendency for investors to sacrifice returns due to bad timing studies show that individual investors lose on average anywhere between 1.2 to 4.3 due to the behavior gap and this gap can be as high as 6.5 for the most active investors compared to the average investor betterment customers have a behavior gap that is 1.25 lower how betterment has implemented smart design to discourage market timing and short sighted decision making   for example betterment ’s tax impact preview feature allows users to view the tax hit of a withdrawal or allocation change before a decision is made currently betterment is the only automated investment service to offer this capability this function allows you to see a detailed estimate of the expected gains or losses broken down by short- and long term making it possible for investors to make better decisions about whether short term gains should be deferred to the long term now for the sake of comparison let ’s assume that we have an even more sophisticated investor investor b who understands the pitfalls of the behavior gap and is somehow able to avoid it betterment is still a better tool for investor b because it offers a suite of tax efficient features including tax loss harvesting smarter cost basis accounting municipal bonds smart dividend reinvesting and more each of these strategies can be automatically deployed inside the portfolio investor b need not do a thing each of these strategies can boost returns by lowering tax exposure to return to your initial question why not simply invest in the s&p 500 investing is a long term proposition particularly when saving for retirement or other goals with a time horizon of several decades to be a successful long term investor means employing the core principles of diversification tax management and behavior management while the s&p might look like a investment one year there are always reversals of fortune the goal with long term passive investing the kind of investing that betterment offers is to help you reach your investing goals as efficiently as possible    lastly betterment offers best in industry advice about where to save and how much to save for no fee

this is because short term debt needs to be rolled over to finance the long term project and so when interest rates rise they will be refinanced at a higher interest rate this means that it will end up costing more than if the company had taken out a long term loan at the lower rate a long term project implies that the beneficial incoming cashflows will be long term but with short term financing the debt will come payable sooner which is why it needs rolling over any beneficial cashflows are not   enough to cover the debt

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

aside from the calculations of how much you save through reducing interest you have two different types of loan here   the house that is mortgaged is not a wasting asset you can reasonably expect that in 2045 it will have retained its worth measured in houses against the other houses in the same neighbourhood in money terms it is likely to be worth more than its current value if only because of inflation to judge the real cost or benefit of the mortgage you need to consider those factors you did n't say whether the is a fixed or variable rate but you also need to consider how the rate might compare with inflation in the long term if you have a fixed rate mortgage and inflation rises above in future you are making money from the loan in the long term not losing what you pay in interest on the other hand your car is a wasting asset and your car loans are just a way of paying by installments over the life of the car if there are no penalties for early repayment the obvious choice there is to pay off the highest interest rates first you might also want to consider what happens if you need to get the $ 11,000 back to use for some other unplanned or emergency purpose if you pay it into your mortgage now there is no easy way to get it back before 2045 on the other hand if you pay down your car loans most likely you now have a car that is worth more than the loans on it in an emergency you could sell the car and recover at least some of the $ 11,000 of course you should keep enough cash available to cover normal emergencies without having to take this sort of action but abnormal emergencies do sometimes happen

the rental income is indeed taxable income but you reduce the taxable portion of it by deducting expenses including mortgage interest maintenance insurance hoa real estate tax and of course depreciation due to the depreciation you may end up breaking even or having very little taxable income note that when you sell the property your basis is reduced by the depreciation you were allowed to deduct even if you have n't deducted it for whatever reason and also the personal residence exclusion might no longer be applicable i.e. you 'll have to pay capital gains tax you will not be able to deduct a loss though if you sell now so it may be better to depreciate it as a rental rather then sell at a loss that wo n't affect your taxes also consider the fact that the basis for the depreciation is not the basis you currently have in the property because you 're under water you have to remember that when calculating the taxes this is not a tax advice and you should seek a professional help

a is a concession stand which happens to show movies in order to lure you into range of the smell of their popcorn it has nothing to do with movie theater monopolies   as it was explained to me by my manager back when i worked in a movie theater in a small chain for every movie the studios take some percentage cut of gross ticket sales varying from movie to movie   star wars the phantom in 1999 was the first film for which the studio demanded 90 of gross ticket price continuing a long standing trend of raising the take which possibly began with the original first star wars movie   the other studios quickly followed suit and raised their take to 90 especially for the big the textbook term is oligopoly pricing and since then the percentage has ever closer to 100   i forget exactly what it was on the second matrix movie or lord of the rings return of the king both of which while i was at the theater but the number that sticks in my head is 94   obviously the studios ca n't directly capture any revenue from the sale of popcorn unlike the movie it 's not their product so every time they raise their take the theater compensates for lost revenue by raising the price of popcorn this trend has n't reversed with 3d and and all the new technologies coming down the   the only reason they 're attractive to the theaters is that the theater can charge $ 15 a ticket rather than $ 10   even on a small percentage share that 's a 50 jump in revenue and covers the not insignificant cost of the projection equipment   3d is also currently getting more butts in seats than was leading to somewhat more concessions sales going to the movies is an and an event again though that 's off as it becomes less and less of a novelty   the ticket prices are n't coming down though moral of the story like razors or printers theaters lose a ton of money to show you movies due to studio oligopoly pricing and make it up on popcorn

that all makes sense but all of those things are the responsibility of the cardholder   if you want to pay off your balance anything quoted would obviously not include any transaction yet to post   the problem is a creditor refusing to give the balance and refusing to take a payment for an amount over the previous statement balance this is essentially forcing the customer to pay more interest after they declare their intent to pay the full amount   good points but i do n't believe those were factors in this case

littleadv is incorrect because receiving a 1099 means she will be taxed self employment tax on top of federal income taxes your employer will automatically withhold 7.65 of payroll taxes as they pay you each paycheck and then they 'll automatically pay the other half of your payroll tax an additional 7.65 to bring it to a total of 15.3 in other words because your wife is technically self employed she will owe both sides of payroll tax which is 15.3 of $ 38k = $ 5,800 on top of your federal income tax which is the only thing the w-4 is instructing them about what amount to withhold the huge advantage to a 1099 however is that she 's essentially self employed which means all of the things she needs to run her business are deductible expenses this includes her car computer home office supplies sometimes phone gas maintenance travel expenses sometimes entertainment etc which can easily bring her income down from $ 38k to lets say $ 23k reducing both her federal income tax and self employment tax to apply to $ 15k less saving lets say 50 of $ 15k = $ with federal and self employment because your income is so high she is actually supposed to pay quarterly taxes to make up for all of this the easy way to do this is each quarter plug your total salary + bonus and the tax you have paid so far check your into turbotax along with her income so far and all of her expenses this will give you how much tax you can expect to have left to owe so far this would be your first quarter when you calculate your other quarters do it the exact same way and just subtract what you 've already paid so far that year from your total tax liability

there is empirical evidence of a correlation between independence of central banks and lower unemployment lower inflation and more stable prices   the argument as to why this is comes from when control central banking more then politicians get involved and they vote for more easier money which looks good in the short run thereby getting them votes but causes inflation unemployment price volatility in the long run when governments control banking you sometimes end up with zimbabwe inflation well not as bad as zimbabwe often but without the govt able to add money at will it is much harder   a significant feature of most successful modern central banks is to remove the control from the hands of i.e. politicians and put control into the hands of skilled economists ever notice the fed chairman and many of the board are actually very well trained economists   full transparency is also bad since some areas of monetary policy need knowledge to be kept from the markets in order to be effective otherwise the fed loses some of the tools they need to try and target inflation   finally there are quite a lot of regulations that the fed does follow including regular outside audits that keep them in check

i 'm not concerned with teaching puerto rico anything it is in puerto rico 's interest to repay their debt for the simple fact that they wo n't be able to operate without access to credit who is gon na lend to puerto rico in the future if these bonds go to zero if everyone is paid back at a reasonable figure puerto rico will be able to borrow again one day and not at a predatory rate this is what i believe is klarman 's thesis for investing in puerto rico 's debt i have no sympathy for the lenders who relaxed their standards nor for the investors that overlooked the risks for the extra yield my point is klarman did nothing to create this situation he just saw value in the bonds when no one else did the article is trying to paint him as a villain for simply owning the bonds after the fact

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

not only is this a marketing gimmick as an article but the principle survey question it cites appears to be pretty stupid i say appears to be rather than is because nowhere can i find the actual wording of the question   compare the following questions   what would make you happier a better boss or a pay raise   what would make you happier exchanging your current boss for the best boss you 've ever had or a 50 increase in pay   in the first case the question apparently asked in the actual survey the is left to interpret the relative sizes of the proposed improvements to their job there 's no reason to believe they 're considering changes of commensurate size and in fact there may be systematic bias toward a more significant envisioned improvement in their boss   frankly i would expect this bias since a person 's attitude toward their boss is often colored by the dictator subject nature of their relationship let 's be honest we are predisposed to dislike people who have authority over us when survey respondents are a better boss they may very well be thinking about a boss who does n't exercise that authority but that 's not a very realistic alternative since such a boss would not be effective from the company 's standpoint   in the second question the has more concrete alternatives to consider their alternative boss is at least now confined by realism this alternative boss had to have at least existed furthermore the pay rise is well specified   finally any survey question on this matter suffers from the cheap talk nature of surveys if actually faced with this choice in the real world would people put their money where their mouth is i would hazard to guess that as long as the pay increase was of a reasonable size more than a few people who indicated better boss would ultimately take pay raise given the actual choice

in the uk recent changes to pension taxation mean that from april 2011 people earning between £ 150,000 and £ 180,000 total and making large pension contributions > £ 50,000 or so will pay a marginal tax rate on additional salary of > 100 this is because pension contributions normally attract tax relief at the highest marginal rate i.e. 40 if the gross salary is above about £ 40,000 and 50 for salaries above £ 150,000 but after april 2011 the rate of relief will be down for gross salaries above £ 150,000 reaching 20 for a gross salary of £ 180,000 so for example if you earn £ and make a contribution of £ 50,000 then an additional £ 1,000 in salary will incur £ 500 of direct tax and also lead to a 1 reduction in tax relief from 25 to 24 costing another £ 500 once you factor in national insurance of another 1 or so the net effect of the pay rise is negative

how realistic is it that i will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so   very unlikely in the next year   the debt income ratio is n't good enough and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range you do n't mention how long you 've been employed at these incomes this can also count against you if you have n't both been employed for a full year at these incomes they will look even more on the employment situation if they are n't both full time jobs although if you have a full year 's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time part time issue next year or so if you pay down your high interest debt car credit cards and maintain employment keep your check stubs and tax returns the loan officer will want copies then there 's a slight chance and from this quick snap shot of our finances does it look like we would be able to qualify for a usda loan probably not   mostly for the same reasons the only time a usda loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment even with an available down payment of 50k you would n't be able to get a regular loan therefore it 's unlikely that you 'd qualify for a usda loan if you are anxious to get into a house choose something much smaller in the range it would improve your debt loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a usda loan   however i think you 'd still have issues if you have n't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year i 'll echo what others have suggested though strengthen your credit eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can car credit cards and keep your jobs for a year or two   start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment at least 3 5 of the desired home price when you are in a better position to buy during this time keep track of your paycheck stubs you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request note that even with a usda loan you still have to pay closing costs and those can run several thousand dollars so do n't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash lastly there 's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size   if you can consider buying the house as if you only had the per year   move the debt to the person making the lower income and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making per year then the debt loan ratio looks very positive   further it may be that the credit history of that person is better and the employment history is better   if one of you has better history in these ways then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house   banks ca n't tell you about this but it does work   keep in mind though that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other 's name   not a great situation to be in so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

i 'll use similar logic to dave ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we 're talking about paying off any debt early   also consider this tweet and what it means for student loans to you they 're debt to the government they 're assets if you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost would you borrow money at interest rate to obtain a degree   put it in the housing way if you paid off your home would you pull out an equity loan line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings   i ca n't answer the question for you or anyone else as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either i can tell you two observations i 've made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time   first it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while   how quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 50 60   it 's not wall street that 's greedy it 's most average investors   second people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as carnegie said concentration is the key to wealth and concentrating your financial energy on something instead of throwing it all over the place can simplify your life   this is one reason why lottery winners do n't keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior   even if you get paid a lot or little that 's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money happiness peace of mind etc follows

there are many aspects to consider in deciding what sort of company you want to form instead of an s corporation you should determine whether it would be better to form a limited liability company llc limited partnership lp or even a professional company pc littleadv is correct there is minimal benefit in forming an s corp with you and your wife as the shareholders if you will be the only contributor worker there are costs associated with an s corporation or any corporation that might outweigh benefits from more favorable tax treatment or personal protection from liability filing fees and disclosure rules vary from state to state for example my father was a who had no employees other than my grandmother she worked for free in a state with income taxes he was advised that a pc was best in new mexico while an s corp was better in florida there are no personal income taxes in florida   the only way to know what to do requires that you consult an accountant a good one for guidance

first of all kudos to you for seeing the value in saving at a young age there are several different things you can mean by this and i 'm not sure which is accurate so i am going to address the first two that i thought of if you are selling your investments because you need the money emergency expenses saved enough for a short term goal whatever the reason then this may not be the best solution for your savings   investing in mutual funds etfs stocks 401k ira etc are typically for longer term goals such as a goal that is 10 + years away maybe buying a home paying for college for your children retirement etc if you are selling your investments because you believe that another investment is performing better and you want to get in on that one instead what i would suggest is leaving the money you have invested where it is and starting future investments in the new fund etf you are interested in   for example if you have $ 2000 invested in fund x and now you do some research and fund q looks more appealing that is great start investing in fund q with your next deposit   any research you do will be based on past results there is nothing that guarantees that fund q will continue doing better than the fund x you already have   trying to time the market rarely ends well for the investor i would encourage you to continue saving money a bit at a time just like you have been doing   avoid selling your investments until it is time to sell them for whatever goal you intended them for   set aside some cash to cover any unexpected expenses so you wo n't have to sell your investments to cover the costs even at 18 unplanned things happen

if you want your bank to pay $ 1 to a beneficiary bob then the service no matter how implemented needs to result in bob 's bank saying to bob hey i owe you $ 1     the usual way how this is done consists of two parts your bank needs to somehow tell bob 's bank hey guys do us a favor and please give bob $ 1 with a message from the sender and your bank needs to convince the other bank that they 'll pay for cover that this is the main source for the delays in international payments there are thousands of banks and most of possible pairs have no legal contact between themselves whatsoever no bilateral agreements no trust and no reasonable enforcement mechanism for small claims if i 'm bob 's bank then a random bank from anywhere from switzerland to nigeria can send me an instruction give bob $ 1 we 'll make it up for you the swift network is a common way of doing this however most likely i 'm going to give bob the money only after i receive the funds somehow which means that they have given the money to some institution i work with for payments within a single country it often is a centralized exchange or a central bank and the payment speed is then determined by the details of that particular single payment network e.g. uk faster payments or the various systems used in usa for international payments it may require a chain of multiple intermediaries correspondent banks for example a payment of $ 1 mm from to china will likely involve the bank asking their main correspondent in usa some major bank such as chase jpmorgan to give the money to the relevant chinese bank 's correspondent in usa say citi to then give the money to that chinese bank to then give the money to the actual recipient each of those steps can happen because those entities have bilateral agreements trust and accounts with each other and each of those steps generally takes time and verification if you want all payments to happen instantly then you need all institutions to join a single binding payment system it 's not as easy as it sounds as it is a nightmare of jurisdiction for example if you 'd want me as bob 's bank to credit bob instantly then the system needs to provide solid guarantees that i would get paid even if a the payer institution changes its mind made a mistake or intentional fraud b the payer institution goes insolvent c the system provider gets insolvent providing such guarantees is expensive they need to be backed by multi billion capital and they 're unrealistic to enforce across jurisdictions e.g. would an iranian bank get recourse if some funds got blocked because of usa sanctions the biggest such project as far as i know is sepa across most of europe visa and mastercard networks perform the same function a merchant gets paid by the cc network even if the payer ca n't pay his cc bill or the paying bank goes insolvent

you can try paper trading to your investing stocks to invest how much money to allocate and stuff but nothing compares to getting beaten black and blue in the real world when virtual money is involved you may n't care because you do n't loose anything but when your hard earned money disappears or grows no paper trading can those feelings in you so there is no guarantee that doing paper trading will make you a better investor but can help you a lot in terms of learning secondly educate yourself on the ways of investing it is hard work and realize that there is no substitute for hard work india is a growing economy and your friends maybe safe in the short term but take it from any investor not in the long run and moreover as all economies are recovering from the recession there are ample opportunities to invest money in india both good and bad calculate your returns and compare it with your friends maybe a year or two down the lane to compare the returns generated from both sides maybe they would come trumps but remember selecting a good investment from a bad investment will surely pay out in the long run   not sure what you do not understand what buffet says it can not get more simpler than that if you can drill those rules into your blood you may n't become a billionaire but surely you will make a killing but in the long run read and read as much as you can buy books browse the net this might help one more guy like you

in general minors can not enter into legally binding contracts    which is what credit accounts are so an individually held card is    probably not an option for you right now you will not be approved for a credit card because you are minor the only option credit card wise for you is for your parents to add you on as an authorized user onto their accounts the upside is that you and your parents can work out a monthly payment for the amount you spend on your equipment the downside is that if your parents do n't pay their credit card bill your credit score report can be negatively affected this also depends on the bank however all the banks i bank with report monthly payment activities on authorized users credit reports as well there might be a bank that does n't   in terms of credit cards there is nothing you can do what you could do as the comments have suggested is either save up money for the equipment you want or buy something cheaper

one of the strengths of 401 k accounts is that you can move from investment x in the program to investment y in the program without tax consequences as you move through your lifetime you will tend to want to lower risk by investing in funds that are less aggressive the only way this works is if there is an ability to move funds if there were only one or two funds to pick from or that you were locked in to your initial choices that would be a very poor 401 k to be enrolled in on your k website you should be able to adjust three sets of numbers some have you enter the current money as a percentage others allow you to enter it in dollars they might limit the number of changes you can do in a month to the current money balances to avoid the temptation to try and time the market these changes usually happen within 1 business day   regarding new and match money they could limit the lowest non zero percent to 5 or 10 but they might allow numbers as low as 1 these changes take place generally with the next paycheck

have you actually read the wikipedia article to calculate the djia the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a divisor the dow divisor the divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits spinoffs or similar structural changes to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the djia early on the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies which made the djia at first a simple arithmetic average the present divisor after many adjustments is less than one meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components that is djia = d where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the dow divisor events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies the index alter the sum of the component prices in these cases in order to avoid in the index the dow divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide djia = = the dow divisor was on december 24 presently every $ 1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a or 1 ÷ point movement knowing the old prices new prices e.g. following a split and old divisor you can easily compute the new divisor edit also the detailed methodology is published by sp indices pdf edit 2 for simplicity 's sake assume the djia is an index that contains 4 stocks with a price of $ 100.00 each one of the stocks splits 2:1 meaning the new price share is $ 50.00 plugging the numbers into the above equation we can determine the new dow divisor 400 4 = 350 d = > d = 3.5

the breach was discovered by equifax on july 29th on august 21st someone bought 2600 put option contracts that were set to expire in september and if the price of remained above $ until then those options would have been worthless on september 7th equifax makes the decision to announce the breach and those put options worth 60 cents a piece skyrocket earning the holder a cool $ 4.2 for perspective those 2600 put options were literally ten times the monthly volume of options on a typical month   there was almost certainly insider trading going on and it probably was n't the hackers themselves logging into their authenticated identifiable brokerage accounts and buying up of put options expiring a month later

depends on the country whether its a currency issuer with floating exchange rate and what the debt is denominated in for instance the us has no real debt b c its all in us dollars and can be printed at any time it has no need to borrow anything it issues its own currency it used to be different 4 decades ago on the gold standard so in general people still think currency issuers need to borrow or earn to spend just a relic in thinking   but when the country does not issue its own currency then it does need to earn or borrow in order to spend in this case it could borrow from anywhere that will lend it money in us a state would fit this description or greece as it borrowed euros for which it is not an issuer of   edit just came across this blog its title where does the money come from maybe he saw this question anyway the us does not need to borrow money why would it borrow what it creates from the video thinking is hard that 's why we do n't do it a lot great line

for non australian residents dividends withholding tax rate is 30   depending upon your country of residence where there is a tax treaty in place to avoid double taxation then this can be reduced   note that only dividends that are are subject to this in australia if tax has already been paid by the company then they can distribute dividends as dividends for example if you owned shares in commonwealth bank of australia cba their most recent dividend from feb 2015 paid 2 april 2015   was $ fully   no withholding tax is applicable there is no capital gains tax for non residents on share transactions there are other tax events that related to large in a company > 10 with property holdings but i 'm guessing that is not an issue

another factor that makes buy to let more expensive is the risk involved with a buy to let you are dependent on finding a tenant that will keep regular payments if the property is left empty you need to finance the mortgage yourself putting you under financial strain and raising risk also as mentioned they are regarded as a business enterprise if the mortgage was to be taken by a business that would be very high risk for a bank as the business could dissolve leaving the bank out of pocket because of this it can be very difficult to get a buy to let through a business unless you are moving from a personal portfolio for a regular mortgage these risks do n't exist so this is reflected in lower interest repayments it 's because of these differences in risk that banks created buy to let so they can better manage those risks

in short pun intended the shareholder lending the shares does not believe that the shares will fall even though the potential investor does the shareholder believes that the shares will rise because the two individuals believe that a different outcome will occur they are able to make a trade by using the available data in the market they have arrived at a particular conclusion of the fair price for the trade but each individual wants to be on the other side of it consider a simpler form of your question why would a shareholder agree to sell his her shares why do n't they just wait to sell when the price is higher after all that is why the buyer wants to purchase the shares on review i realize i 've only stated here why the original shareholder would n't simply sell and rebuy the share themselves because they have a different view of the market as to why they would actually allow the trade to occur and other answers point out that the shares being lent are compensated for by an initial fee on the transaction + the chance for interest during the period that the shares are owed for

i 'm not sure what you expect in terms of answers but it depends on personal factors it pretty well has to depend on personal factors since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at or everyone thinks it 's one to buy at and there would be no trades you would n't be able to do what you want except on the liquidity provided by market makers once that 's hit the price is shifting quickly so your calculation will change quickly too purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money it 's all about the same the market should already know everything you know which means that one time to sell is as good as any other the current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because there 's a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet that 's not to say there are n't clever sure fire trading strategies around acquisitions but they 're certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock if you have information that the market does n't and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information if you know something the market does n't that 's going to be good for price hold if you know something that will reduce the price sell now and know can be used in a loose sense if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that nothing beats being paid for being right finally bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility you have your own investment goals and your own view of risk if you 're more risk averse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition if you 're more risk prone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of $ 1 to that 's fine hold the stock the extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up put everything into the most secure investments you can find and retire to the caribbean if that 's the case then you become totally risk averse the instant your holding crosses that line sell and order cocktails

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

thirty thousand in credit card debt is a big elephant to eat so to speak   but you do it by taking a bite at a time   one positive is that you do not want to borrow from your 401k.   doing so is a horrible idea the first question you have to ask yourself and understand is how you accumulated 30 k in credit card debt in the first place   most people get there by running up a relatively small amount say 5 k and playing the zero transfer game a few times   then add in a late payment and a negative event or two like the car breaking down or a trip to the emergency room and poof a large amount of credit card debt    obviously i have no idea if this is how you got there and providing some insight might help    also your age approximate income and other debts might also help provide more insight   i assume you are still working and under age 59.5 as you are talking about borrowing from your 401k. where i come from is that my wife then girlfriend found ourselves under stifling debt a few years ago   when we married we became very intentional and focused on ourselves of debt and now sit completely debt free including the house   during our debt payoff time we lived off of less than 25 of our salary   we both took extra jobs when we were able   intensity was our key      if i were you i would not refi the house   there are costs associated with this and why would you put more debt on your home i might cash out the annuity provided that there are no negative tax consequences and depending on how much you can get for it   numbers are the key here   however i feel like doing so will not retire this debt the first thing you need to do is get on a written budget   a game plan for spending and stick to it   if you are married your spouse has to be part of this process   the budget has to be fresh each month and each month you and your wife should meet   to deviate from the budget you will also need to have a meeting   my wife and i still do this despite being debt free and enjoying very healthy incomes secondly it is about cutting expenses   cable off   no eating out or vacations   cut back on cell phone plans only basic clothing   gift giving is of the $ 5 variety and only for those very close to you   forget lattes etc   depending on your income i would cut 401 k contributions to zero or only up to the company match if your household income is above 150k year third it is about earning more   ebay deliver pizzas cut grass overtime whatever    all extra dollars go to credit card balance reduction   at a minimum you should find an extra $ 1000/month however i would shoot for   if you can find 2 k you will be done with this in 13 months   i know the math does n't work out for that but once you get momentum you find more how good will it feel to be out from under this oppression next march   i know you can do this without cashing in the annuity or refinancing   do you believe it

something to consider is how broad is yahoo finance taking in their data for making some comparisons   for example did you look at the other companies in the same industry   on the industry page the top life insurance companies by market cap are mostly british companies which could make things a bit different than you 'd think another point is how this is just for one quarter which may be an anomaly as the data could get a bit awkward if some companies are just coming back to being profitable and could have what appears to be great growth but this is because their earnings grow from $ to $ 1/share which is a growth of $ 10,000 percent as this is an increase of 100 times but really this may just be from various accounting charges the company had that hit its reserves and caused its earnings to dip temporarily

my son who is now 21 has never needed me to cosign on a loan for him and i did not need to establish any sort of credit rating for him to establish his own credit   one thing i would suggest is ditch the bank and use a credit union i have used one for many years and opened an account there for my son as soon as he got his first job he was able to get a debit card to start which does n't build credit score but establishes his account work the credit union he was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic bs that comes with dealing with a large bank his interest rate may be a bit higher due to his lack of credit score initially but because we taught him about finance it is n't really relevant because he does n't carry a balance he has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college   the idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy like my son i started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 the credit union probably should n't have done that since i was n't old enough to be legally bound my first car at 18 or my first home at 22 for both my son and i knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they are n't old enough to be legally liable for the debt using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason each financial institution will have their own rules and i certainly do n't know them all   for what you are proposing i would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union being small and locally controlled you will probably find that you have the best luck there

in some sense the share repurchasing program is better if the company does not foresee the same profit levels down the road   paying a dividend for several years and then suddenly not paying or reducing a dividend is viewed as a slap in the face by investors   executing a share repurchase program one year and then not the next is not viewed as negatively from an investor 's standpoint i would say a dividend is preferred over a share repurchase program for a similar reason   typically companies that pay a dividend have been doing so for quite some time and even increasing it over time as the company increases profits   so it can be assumed that if a company starts paying a dividend it will do so for the long run

foreign stocks tend to be more volatile higher risk trades off against higher return potential always the better reason for having some money in that area is that as with bonds it moves out of sync with the us markets and once you pick your preferred distribution maintaining that balance semi automatically takes advantage of that to improve your return vs risk position i have a few percent of my total investments in an international stock index fund and a few percent in an international reit both being fairly low fee low fees mean more of the money reaches you and seems to be one of the better reasons for preferring one fund over another following the same segment of the market they 're there because the model my investment advisor uses and validated with monte carlo simulation of my specific mix shows that keeping them in the mix at this low level is likely to result in a better long term outcome than if i left them out no guarantees but probabilities lean toward this mix doing what i need i do n't pretend to be able to justify that via theory or to explain why these specific ratios work but i understand enough about the process to trust that they are on perhaps of many reasonable solutions to get the best odds given my specific risk tolerance timeline and distaste for actively managing my money more than a few times a year if that

i know its not legal to have open long and short position on specific security on two stock exchanges nse bse there is nothing illegal about it there are prescribed ways on how this is addressed   in cash segment intra day trades    one can short sell a security if by end of day he does not buy the security it goes into auction the said security is purchased on your behalf any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you similarly one can buy a security if one does not pay the amount by end of day it would go into auction and sold any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you if you short sell a security on one exchange you have to buy it on same exchange if you buy on other exchange it will not be adjusted against this short position also is it legal to have long position on stock and short its derivative future option there are no restrictions edit party a shorts 10 shares of hdfc today in intra day cash segment purchased by party b. rather than buying back 10 shares or allowing it to go into auction party a borrows 10 hdfc shares from x via for a period of say 6 months 1 month to 1 year this is recorded as party a obligation to x these 10 borrowed shares are transferred to party b. so party x does n't have any hdfc shares at this point in time however in exchange party x receives fees for borrowing from party a. if there is dividend are declared company pays party b. however recovers identical amount from party a and pays party x. if there is 1:1 split now party a owes party x 20 hdfc shares on maturity after 6 months party a has to buy these from market and given back the borrowed shares to party x. if there are some other corporate actions i.e. mergers the obligation of party a to party x is closed immediately and position settled of course there are provisions whereby party a can pay back the shares earlier or party x can ask for shares earlier and there are rules trades mechanisms to facilitate this

two questions please feel free to pick either one or answer both if you want   1   if tax reform does get passed and corporate amp income taxes are reduced consolidated what will be 1 the short term effect on the u.s national debt and 2 the long term effect on the debt factoring in the obvious and already priced in supply side growth potential of the tax cuts    it seems to me that the gop tea partiers deficit hawks that rose to political power in 2010 2012 have gone oddly mute on the probable increase in the federal debt as a result of both the proposed trump tax cuts and wasteful budget provisions like wall funding enforcement ect    2 a. what is your best guess of the reaction of u.s amp european asset markets eq amp bonds in the event of a war on the korean peninsula with both conventional and weapons amp methods used on north south korea as well as u.s ally japan    i ask because the economic fundamentals of u.s western europe are strong and am wondering whether an obvious negative market shock nuclear war would be enough to send those respective western economies into recession financial crisis     b. what will be the geopolitical result does china back nk to prevent a immigration power vacuum or do they side with the un u.s and allow military destruction of nk in the event of a nk started war

this model would work fine under a couple of assumptions that market interest rates never change and that the borrower will surely make all the payments as agreed   but neither of those assumptions are realistic suppose alice loans $ 1,000,000 to bob at 4 under the terms you describe   bob chooses to make interest only payments of $ 40,000 per year some time later prevailing interest rates go up to 10   now alice would really like bob to repay the entire principal as quickly as possible because that money could be earning her $ 100,000 per year instead of only $ 40,000 but under the contract she has no way to force bob to do so   and bob has no incentive to repay any of the principal because he can earn more interest on it than he has to pay to alice   so alice is not going to be very happy about this you might say but at least alice is only losing potential money she 's still turning a profit of $ 10,000 per year since her bank only charges her 3 interest   ah but you 're assuming that alice can get a bank loan with a rate of 3 fixed forever   the bank does n't want to make such a loan either for exactly the same reasons so in practice any loan like this would be expected to have a variable interest rate there 's a flip side too   suppose instead that market rates drop to 1   now alice would like bob to repay the principal as slowly as possible because she 's earning 4 on that money which is better than any other options available to her   but bob now has every incentive to repay it as fast as he can or even to refinance by taking out another loan at say 2 and using the proceeds to repay the entire principal to alice   this risk still applies with most traditional loans since the borrower usually always has the right to pay early but some loans include a prepayment penalty in such cases to help compensate the lender thus when bob has all the power to decide when to pay alice is sure to lose no matter which way interest rates move   a loan with a fixed term helps insulate alice against this risk   she may be able to make a guess about the likelihood of interest rates going up to 10 in the next 15 or 30 years and increase bob 's fixed rate to account for this that 's much easier than trying to account for the possibility of interest rates going up to 10 ever   and if she does have to try to account for this she 's probably going to have to set the interest rate extremely high so bob might accept a fixed term of repayment in exchange for a more reasonable rate even if we suppose that alice has done the best possible credit check and that bob is a perfectly trustworthy fellow who would never dream of defaulting on his loan catastrophes do happen   maybe bob is robbed of all his money by an evil accountant or has a mid life crisis and spends it all on tickets   whatever bob is now bankrupt and alice is never going to get her principal back nor any further interest payments either   even if the loan is secured by some collateral there 's still a risk since the collateral might lose value   alice has some chance of estimating the risk of this happening in the next 15 or 30 years and can set the interest rate to compensate for it   but it is harder for her to estimate the risk of this happening ever and if she tries she 'll have to set the rate so high that bob might prefer a fixed term and a lower rate there 's a side issue as to what happens if bob dies with the loan still outstanding   if it 's an unsecured loan typically alice can try to collect the principal from bob 's estate but if there is n't enough too bad for alice she ca n't force bob 's heirs to continue making payments   if it 's a secured loan alice may be able to have bob 's heirs continue paying or else she the collateral but she still has the risk of the collateral losing value

you 'd have to check the terms of your contract on most installment loans i think they calculate interest monthly not daily that is if you make 3 payments of $ 96 over the course of the month instead of one payment of $ at the end of the month but before the due date it makes absolutely zero difference to their interest calculation they just total up your payments for the month that 's how my mortgage works and how some past loans i 've had worked all you 'd accomplish is to cost yourself some time postage if you 're mailing payments and waste the bank 's time processing multiple payments if the loan allows you to make pre payments which i think most loans today do then what does work is to make an extra payment or an overpayment if you have a few hundred extra dollars make an extra payment this reduces your principle and reduces the amount of interest you pay every month for the remainder of the loan and if you 're paying $ 1 less in interest then that extra dollar goes against principle which further reduces the amount you pay in interest the next month this and can save you a lot in the long run better still instead of paying $ each month pay say $ 300 then every month you 're away at the principle faster and faster for example i calculate that if you 're paying $ per month you 'll pay the loan off in 72 months and pay a total of $ in interest pay $ 300 per month and you 'll pay it off in 67 months with a total of $ interest okay not a huge deal pay $ 350 per month and you pay it off in 55 months with $ interest i just did quick calculations with a spreadsheet not accurate to the penny but close enough for comparison ps this is different from revolving credit like credit cards where interest is calculated on the average daily balance with a credit card making multiple payments would indeed reduce your interest but not by much if you pay $ 100 every 10 days instead of $ 300 at the end then you 're saving the interest on 20 days x $ 100 + 10 days x $ 100 so 12.5 = 0.03 per day so 0.03 x $ = 90 cents if you 're mailing your payments the postage is 49 cents x 2 extra payments = 98 cents you 're losing 8 cents per month by doing this

expenses imo the best way to deal with this situation is by treating you staying at her house as renting a room as stated he does with his partner in the comments of another answer   this means you pay x amount of dollars a week to her as rent which she can most likely choose to put it towards house insurance interest repayments repairs and improvements etc etc from there you split your living expenses 50/50 living expenses include stuff like telephone internet utility bills food contents insurance etc renting income then the earnings losses you make from renting your apartment out are yours alone after all if your place gets trashed by a tenant with a meth lab she wo n't and should n't have to pay the ridiculous amounts of money required to get it fixed up   determining the rent to pay not ideal but an easy method use your place 's renting value as a indicator market research example to determine how much rent you would pay to her however since you are only a half resident at her place you would only pay half   ideal your place would have a different renting value to hers so do some research together and find a median renting value of her house based on similar houses or ask her how much she wants you to pay in rent since after all the owner of the house has final say on the renting value you might want to consider that you staying with her is a more secure tenancy as she knows you wo n't wreak her place but the same can not be said for the tenant you have in your place post in the comments if you think this last sentence should be removed i 'm on the fence about it but it seems relevant disclaimer remember you are considering a long term relationship with her do n't get too picky and do n't let it get personal emotional when deciding the renting amounts

excess cash = cash equivalents + long term investments current liabilities the problem this calculation of excess cash is that long term investments can be illiquid things like real estate another flaw is that it gives no credit for current assets like receivables which can be used to offset current liabilities the first thing i 'd do is net out current assets and current liabilities then add cash back in   excess cash = current assets current liabilities + cash equivalents it would be nice if gaap would require long term investments to be broken out as a liquid long term investments stocks bonds b illiquid long term investments real estate private equity etc

i would steer well clear of this the risk is that they take your money but do n't pay the bank this would n't require dishonesty what if they run into financial trouble any money of yours that they have that has n't gone on to the bank yet might end up paying off other debts instead of yours it 's not clear if the idea is that you are paying them all the money up front or will be making payments over time but either way if they do n't clear the lien with the bank then the bank can come after the car no matter who is in physical possession of it that would leave you without either the money or the car in theory you 'd have a legal claim against the seller but in reality you 'd probably find it hard to collect

your premise is flawed so i 'm going to say you have no clue what you 're talking about    apple is a hardware company first and foremost always has been and likely always will be so when they see the market they see software as something to give away because software sells hardware   they make their bread and butter selling computers and device not mobile me accounts or os x or upgrades    microsoft is a software company through and through when they see the market they see a world full of computers that can run their software for a fee    but that well is drying up manufacturers are leaving so what does msft do get in the hardware game themselves because hardware sells software that 's the one and only rational they were willing to drop billions upon billions of dollars into xbox and make it into an ecosystem    sony 's problem is that they grew so big they 're too big most people only see the surface consumer stuff anchored by fancy tvs or ps3 but they do so much more within b2c and    hell sony makes produces sells distributes plays stores transfers enhances media content on various levels but they 're not best of class anymore on any level and the groups do n't work hand in hand    the company is melting down the same way america is melting down weak central leadership competing ideology how can a company that makes movies sell movie players and exponential levels of complexity    throw in the multinational field sony operates in versus the much fewer countries apple and microsoft operate in and it 's a gigantic mess    i have a head for systems and big orgs but i do not envy the man that has to push that beast along

gt but we as a society do not even offer enough college courses to let people learn new skills   is this part of the problem we as a society seem to be fascinated by training i know of several people who are quite capable but feel inadequate in doing a job until what they are doing has been validated by someone else through formal training   i believe this is where 's coworker was coming from when the fit was r business comments learning a new skill in her coworker 's eyes means going back to a place of training and nobody wants to go back to college once they are in an established career not unless it is happening as part of the job on the company dime   a lot of these people grew up in a time where they were constantly reminded that college was the only way to find a job the idea that you can learn some real marketable skills over the weekend just by playing with a hobby project would never occur to these people because to them college = job

i think you raise a very good point here    it is a very well known fact that the us is not a leader in automated manufacturing europe has traditionally been the place that consumes the majority of the automated manufacturing equipment that in turn comes out of japan    japan specializes in the manufacture of automated manufacturing equipment and has since the us this market to them in the 1950s offering the japanese access to the technology created at general motors called ladder logic and logic controllers these technologies were created from scratch on the shop floor at general motors at a time when there was a saying that what is good for general motors is good for the america   this was back before were affordable those early manufacturing robots actually used of and ladder logic which is still used till this days in the robots that come out of japan is still based on although they are now virtual    the japanese ran with the tech and now many people believe that the japanese invented it certainly they refined it over the years but the early work was handed to them in part as an effort to win them over from their potential allegiance with the japan was always a much larger lynch pin than either korea or vietnam where the actual military battles went down what was really scary to america was losing japan and the transfer of robotics technology to the japanese was part of the arrangement to keep them cozy with the us military empire    but the largest customer was not within japan the actual sales of equipment went to the europeans that 's where automated manufacturing is currently at its peak however things have been rapidly changing and for over a decade the fastest rising automation market has been china    currently foxconn or the large contract manufacturer famous for their apple contracts is in the process of building an automation base in the middle of taiwan    if you want jobs in automated manufacturing technology you should be studying chinese as well as

sorry i did n't mean to knock your post   i do think you have valid points   i think it 's great to see discussions on the pros and cons on the vc start up world   my previous work experience was at a start up that made it big sold 90 to news corp at $ 400 mm valuation but was funded by angel investors so it was a different situation   i 'm currently getting my mba now so am looking at the space from both the vc perspective and the start up perspective   vcs can provide real value to start ups and they can also harm them   however no one is forcing the start ups to take vc money most do because it provides a higher probability for a faster path to success   the investment does n't come free obviously as you pointed out   the hours are horrible and you lose significant control   in many situations founders are taken away from the main leadership role   that does n't seem fair   however if someone sold the voting shares of their company they are opting in for that risk   the truth of the matter is that a lot of the people who are amazing at the ideas that birth the start ups are horrible at the day to day management   sometimes vcs step in and make the necessary changes to ensure the best chance at company profitability   is it fair yes   does it suck for the person ousted absolutely   it 's an oversimplification to say this is all bad or all good   it all depends on the situation   however yes there are vcs who are predatory and use their superior knowledge of how business financing and whatever else work to extract as much as they can from their portfolio companies   yet there are also some who honestly love the industry and want to help companies grow     your article 's stance is good because it prompts a discussion   however as i originally felt it does not do it as effectively as it could in my opinion   that 's awesome you got a ton of re tweets but as you say on your blog it 's about substance not the glitter and     edit voting do n't count as glitter and

it 's not like most of the people working there will care if obama loses his job the chief position of a government agency who is selected by potus often is n't a person liked by the rest of the agency and they could n't care less if he was changed in 2013   for example in the cia the director was always chosen by the president and thusly the rest of the cia usually do n't fully respect them since they are just some random person from outside the agency who was put into power for political reasons they do n't like the director and likewise do n't care if potus changes and the director gets fired by the new guy    my point is that entire government agencies are not lying and cheating just to keep obama in office just because the director was appointed by obama does n't mean the entire organization will lie to help obama    i mean what if romney gets elected will the entire agency and it 's hundreds thousands of employees now immediately do a 180 and lie and cheat to keep romney in power the same workers that were doing illegal things to help obama and now going to on a whim break laws to help romney    these agencies are not machines they are made of hundreds of real people each with their own views just because obama chose the director does n't mean all those people are now his slaves willing to lie and cheat to help him    what 's to stop one of them from leaking the story to the media i would think there has to be at least one republican working there if the director told everyone that this quarter they were all going to lie to help obama stay in power pretty sure any republicans in the agency would leak that to the media if that story got out obama would be    no way the entire agency would go forward with a lie to help obama

1040es uses the smaller number because that 's what triggers the penalties   that is you are penalized if what you prepay is less than your total 2013 liability and less than 90 of your 2014 liability   however estimated taxes are just estimates   if you pay too little you could face a penalty but there 's no penalty for paying too much you 'll just get a refund as usual it seems that your concern stems from the fact that this is the first year you 're in this tax situation and so you 're unsure if your estimates are accurate   in your comment to pete 's answer you also indicated you are n't worried about being unable to pay but only about accidentally underpaying in this case you could just err on the side of caution and pay more than 1040es says you owe   you do n't actually file the 1040es the calculations are just for your own use   for instance you could prepay based on the higher of your two estimates if you can afford it or if you ca n't afford that much hedge the estimate payments up a bit to an amount you can afford that is closer to the higher estimate   at the end of the year if you paid too much you can get a refund as usual   after this year you will presumably have a better sense of your income and your tax liability and can make more accurate estimates for next year

you should ensure that your broker is a member of the securities investor protection corporation sipc sipc protects the cash and securities in your brokerage account much like the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic protects bank deposits securities are protected with a limit of $ 500,000 usd cash is protected with a limit of $ 250,000 usd it should be noted that sipc does not protect investors against loss of value or bad advice as far as having multiple brokerage accounts for security i personally do n’t think it ’s necessary to have multiple accounts for that reason depending on account or transaction fees it might not hurt to have multiple accounts it can actually be beneficial to have multiple accounts so long as each account serves a purpose in your overall financial plan for example i have three brokerage accounts each of which serves a specific purpose one provides low cost stock and bond transactions another provides superior market data and the third provides low cost mutual fund transactions if you ’re worried about asset security there are a few things you can do to protect yourself i would recommend you begin by consulting a qualified financial advisor about your risk profile you stated that a considerable portion of your total assets are in securities depending on your risk profile and the amount of your net worth held in securities you might be better served by moving your money into lower risk asset classes i ’m not an attorney or a financial advisor this is not legal advice or financial advice you can and should consult your own attorney and financial advisor

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

supply and demand pure and simple there are two basic forms of this a change in the quantity demanded supplied at any given price and a true change in the amount of demand supply itself please note that this can be distinct from the underlying change in the value of the company and/or its expected future cash flows which are a function of both financial performance and future expectations if more people want the stock that are willing to sell it at a given price at a given point in time sellers will begin to offer the stocks at higher prices until the market is no longer willing to bear the new price and vice versa this will reduce the quantity of stocks demanded by buyers until the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied once again reach an equilibrium at which point a transaction occurs because people are motivated to buy and sell for different reasons at different times and because people have different opinions on a constant flow of new information prices change frequently this is one of the reasons why executives of a recent ipo do n't typically sell all of their stock at once in addition to legal restrictions and the message this would send to the market if they flooded the market with additional quantities of stock supplied all else being equal since there is no corresponding increase in the quantity demanded the price would drop significantly sometimes the demand itself for a company 's stock shifts unlike a simple change in price driven by quantity supplied versus quantity demanded this is a more fundamental shift for example let 's suppose that the current demand for rare earth metals is driven by their commercial applications in consumer electronics now if new devices are developed that no longer require these metals the demand for them will fall regardless of the actions of individual buyers and sellers in the market another example is when the rules of the game for an industry change dramatically markets are behavioral in this sense prices are most directly driven by human behavior which hopefully is based on well informed opinions and facts this is why sometimes the price keeps going up when financial performance decreases and why sometimes it does not rise even while performance is improving this is also why some companies stock continues to rise even when they lose huge sums of money year after year the key to understanding these scenarios is the opinions and expectations that buyers and sellers have of that information which is expressed in their market behavior

you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher    than your interest rate your next line about standard deviation is dead on   there are too many variables to give an exact answer here in my opinion the main reason is that one variable is n't easy to quantify one 's risk tolerance   clearly there 's one extreme the 18 credit card unless you are funding type rates of it 's safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments except for the matched 401(k deposits   what i think you 're talking about is something we 've addressed here in multiple threads   do i prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest in this case and to noah 's comment the question is whether you can expect a post tax return of over 3 during your time horizon i look at the return for 15 years from 1998 2013 and see a 6 cagr for the s&p. i chose 15 years as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster as fast as 15 the last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net   you can pull the data back to 1871 and run cagr numbers for the timeframe of your choosing i have n't done it yet but i imagine there 's no 15 year span that lags the 3 target i cite   what makes it more complex is that the investment is n't lump sum it may not be obvious but cagr is a dollar invested at t=0 and returns calculated to t = final year it would take a bit of to invest the extra funds every month year over your period of analysis   in the end there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10 the feeling of risk is more than many will want

it is possible for him to get a loan against the house as long as the all takes place at the same time as the loan is closing basically you and your brother will both have paperwork to sign and the title company will not send out checks until the loan funds from the mortgage company for that to take place the estate will generally have to be fully settled that can take time but you might wish to retain a lawyer to be certain your interests are completely protected many people feel like getting legal representation will strain family relationships but i find the opposite to be true they often grease the wheels and get the process finished quickly and fairly which ultimately reduces such strain i would view it as a good sign if he is paying off large debts because that means he will be in a better position to take a mortgage to pay you your share but that assumes he is acting in good faith

diversifying your portfolio between asset a and asset b only reduces the portfolio risk if asset a and asset b are not correlated if they have either a low correlation or a negative correlation to each other then you benefit from combining them in a portfolio in terms of risk reduction the standard deviation of returns will be lower in a portfolio of low or uncorrelated assets if on the other hand you combine two correlated assets into a portfolio you are doubling down on the same assumption which means you are not reducing your risk you are also wasting capital because now you have allocated capital to 2 separate trades investments yet they have shown a high tendency of moving together here is an article that discusses this further why diversify your stock portfolio

do n't let the tax tail wag the investment dog there is risk in exchanging this known property for another unknown property that risk may be more than $ 9000 worth of risk tax considerations are important but most important is that your investments make money if you intend to continue as a landlord you had better be sure you are finding a better deal elsewhere if you are going to trade this property up i should also mention that you have a 5 year window in which you need to have lived in the home for 2 years you have time and might be able to sell for a higher price if you wait a little longer

this is a tough question   let 's try and the metric first let 's expand upon the notion share price is determined in an efficient market where prospective buyers and sellers have access to info on an enterprises cash balance and they may weigh that into their decision making   therefore a desirable undesirable cash balance may raise or lower the share price to what extent we do not know    we must ask how significant is cash debt balance in determining the market price of a stock    as you noted we have limited info which may decrease the weight of these account balances in our decision process using a level of 5 of net income of operations cash debt may be immaterial or not considered by an investor investors oftentimes interpret the same information differently e.g. microsoft 's large cash balance may show they no longer have innovative ideas worth investing in or they are well positioned to acquire innovative companies or weather a contraction in the sector my guess is a math mind would ignore the affect of account balances on the equity portion of the enterprise value calculation because it may not be a factor or because the affect is subjective

when the corporate tax rate is increased corporations either pass tax this on to 1 consumers through higher prices 2 shareholders through smaller fewer dividend payouts or 3 employees through lower wages    the paper argues that the tax burden mainly falls on the shareholders which is whoever owns the stock capital income effectively investors and retirement accounts mutual funds etc

the only way that a more distributed government can be established in a larger and less socially connected than that of a tribe is through brute force if you think that the ussr was a model of good government and economics push for force    government that rules over groups of people that do not share a close cultural connection can either be a very loose arrangement or it can rule with the force of a brutal state an empire with different ethnic linguistic racial and national origin groups spread out over a large area can only redistribute wealth by stealing it with force and then it will be handed out to those with political connections that is exactly what is happening now the people that are receiving the distribution of the federal government today are the primary dealer banks

your tax bracket is determined by your total taxable income in a given year where money drawn from a traditional style deferred tax 401k or ira is taxable income money drawn from a roth account was taxed before deposit and is not taxed when withdrawn after the relevant date your recent salary history has no effect on this except salary in the same year and there is no advantage to be gained by taking a deliberate pay cut for its own sake

the truth   most of the time that it was a crappy of mad it was actually a mob front used to hide and launder money   management did n't care one bit about the content so long as it was turned in on time and seemed reasonably professional so as not to suspicion i knew someone who did some freelance work for them back in the day   i suspect that is no longer the case

i typed out a long ish answer but i 'm just going to direct you to this archive papers instead which seems to summarize the available contracts quite well   the biggest problem i see is infrastructure and credit risk say you have somebody with land who wants to start up a farming operation as the financial institution how do you know this person can actually deliver the goods to a distributor how do you know they wo n't just default on their payments the lack of creditworthiness is a big problem in developing countries and many countries lack the proper legal institutions to enforce the contracts further complicating the problem   i think your idea is good but i think widespread retail financing operations in developing countries need a lot of boots on the ground as it were to ensure you know who you 're lending to other alternatives are to just require a huge amount of collateral but impoverished farmers by their definition probably wo n't be able to meet this requirement

another way to look at this is that pure insider trading is an activity with the aim to use secret information to make personal profit or let others make personal profit at the expense of the company shareholders or investors in buybacks it is not company managers to get personal gain in this would be insider trading the end winners in this case are the shareholders so there is nothing inherently bad in buying back stock moreover it is a general practice to buy shares back as opposed to paying dividends when the company sees its shares being undervalued of course provided that it has the cash borrowing ability to implement this since it creates shareholders value thereby maximising shareholder wealth which is one of the primary tasks of the company managers

because even if you won the lottery without at least some credit history you will have trouble renting cars and hotel rooms i learned about the importance and limitations of credit history when in the 90 's i switched from using credit cards to doing everything with a debit card and checks purely for convenience eventually my unused credit cards were not renewed at that point in my life i had saved a lot and had high liquidity i even bought new autos every 5 years with cash then last decade i found it increasingly hard to rent cars and sometimes even a hotel rooms with a debit card even though i would say they could whatever they thought necessary to cover any expenses i might run i started investigating why and found out that hotels and car rentals saw having a credit card as a proxy for low risk that you would damage the car or hotel room and not pay so then i researched credit cards credit reports and how they worked they have nothing about any savings investments or bank accounts you have i had no idea this was the case and since i had n't had cards or bought anything on credit in over 10 years there were no records in my credit files old closed accounts had fallen off after 10 years so i opened a couple of secured credit cards with the highest security deposit allowed they unsecured after a year or so then i added several rewards cards i use them instead of a debit card and always pay in full and they provide some cash back so i save money compared to just using a debit card after 4 years my credit score has gone to 800 + even though i have never carried any debt and use the cards as if they were debit cards i was very foolish to have stopped using credit cards 20 years ago but just had no idea of the importance of an established credit history and note that establishing a great credit history does not require that you borrow money or take out loans for anything just get credit cards and pay them in full each month

actually it is because of trade tariffs import tax which the us charges on automobiles the big auto manufacturers in the us have lobbied extensively to help increase the cost of vehicles manufactured overseas and imported into the us so as a work around international auto manufacturers set up plants within the us so as to avoid paying some of the import tariffs
