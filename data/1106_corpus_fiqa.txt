as was once famously said our new constitution is now established and has an appearance that promises but in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes â€‰ benjamin franklin it 's very likely that either the company or you personally is going to have to pay taxes on that money really the only way to avoid it would be if the company spent that money on next year 's expenses and paid the bill before the end of this year of course you can only do that if the recipient is willing to receive their money so far in advance which is n't necessarily the case since they would pay more taxes this year as a result as for whether it 's better to have the company pay the tax or for you to do as your accountant suggests there are a lot of factors that go into that equation and my gut feeling is that your accountant already ran it both ways and is suggesting the better choice

for a more philosophical way to approach this consider money saved as the opposite of money owed this philosophy works for things which you may be able to borrow for computer car house but also for things you ca n't borrow for retirement giving to your kids etc as others have mentioned the 10 suggestion is for retirement but the actual number depends on your lifestyle as you can see in this chart saving 10 of your income means you 'll need to work for years

if you are a novice investor and want to diversify i 'd recommend looking into targeted mutual funds they could n't be easier you just put your money in the fund with the year that you anticipating needing to take the money out and the fund manager handles diversification and adjusting the risk appropriately over the life of the fund based on the remaining time horizon the only downside is that the annual expenses tend to be higher on these than if you just invested in the underlying securities funds but you are pretty much paying them to manage it for you

the portfolio described in that post has a blend of small slices of vanguard sector funds such as vanguard pacific stock index   and the theory is that rebalancing across them will give you a good risk return tradeoff   caveat i have n't read the book only the post you link to similar etfs are available from vanguard ishares and state street   if you want to replicate the exactly pick from them   if you have questions about how to match specific funds in australia just ask another question   so i think you could match it fairly exactly if you wanted to however i think trying to exactly replicate the gone portfolio in australia would not be a good move for most people for a few reasons brokerage and management fees are generally higher in australia smaller market so dividing your investment across ten different securities and rebalancing is going to be somewhat more expensive if you have a middle class sized portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars you 're cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5 to various sectors   to keep brokerage costs low you probably want to buy each etf only once every one two years or so   you also need to keep track of the tax consequences of each of them if you are earning and spending australian dollars and looking at the portfolio in australian dollars a lot of those assets are going to move together as the australian dollar moves regardless of changes in the underlying assets   so there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the us the post does n't mention the 's approach to tax   i expect they do consider it but it 's not going to be directly applicable to australia if you are more interested in implementing the general approach of rather than the specific details what i would recommend is the vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the with a mix of local first world and emerging market shares bonds and property trusts   this is pretty much fire and forget contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing spreading across asset classes and tax calculations   by my calculations the cost is very similar the diversification is very similar and it 's much easier the only thing they do n't generally cover is a precious metals allocation and if you want that just put 5 of your money into the asx gold etf or something similar

you are going to need a lawyer anyway so check with him    but here is a path you might be able to go down    put the house in your name right from the get go   he gives you the money but you sign over a promissory note to him so that you net less than $ 14000 gift tax annual exclusion for the calendar year he can gift everyone in your household 14k per year tax free and he could gift it to you and your partner in less than 7 years   you can pay him back in anyway you like or not at all as the promissory note could be reduced by per year i think a cpa and lawyer in your state would be able to confirm that this would work for you

the fluctuation of interest rates during the next year could easily dwarf the savings this attempt to improve your credit score will have or the reverse is true will the loan improve your score enough to make a difference it will not change the number of months old your oldest account is it will increase the breadth of your accounts applying for the car loan will result in a short term decrease in the score because of the hard pull the total impact will be harder to predict   a few points either way will generally not have an impact on your rate you will also notice the two in your question differ by more than 30 points you ca n't control which number the lender will use you also have to realize the number differs every day depending on when they pull it that month the addition of a car loan assuming you still have the loan when you buy the house will not have a major impact on your ability to get afford the home mortgage the bank cares about two numbers regarding monthly payments the amount of your mortgage including principal interest taxes and insurance and the amount of all other debt payments car loan school loans credit cards the number should be no more than of your monthly income the other payments no more than 10   if the auto loan payments fit in the 10 window then the amount of money you can spend each month on the mortgage will not be impacted if it is too large then they will want to see a smaller amount of your income to go to if you buy the car either by cash or by loan after you apply for the mortgage they will be concerned because you are impacting directly numbers they are using to evaluate your financial health i have experienced a delay because the buyer bought a car the week before closing the biggest impact on your ability to get the loan is the greater than 20 down payment assuming you can still do that if you pay cash for the car   do n't deplete your savings to get to the 50 down payment level keep money for closing costs moving expenses furnishing plus other emergencies make it clear that you can easily cover the 20 level and are willing to go higher to make the loan numbers work

while i totally agree with you talking to free market people you have to address it this way    their point is that they should pay what the market bears not what you want to make   that is fair     but that market has shown they need to pay more but they ca n't do it      roofing is a perfect example    charge $ 6000 for a roof materials cost $ 2000    labor costs $ 800    the rest is additional expenses and profit   even if you have to give your roofers a 25 raise that is $ 200   you are n't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you ca n't tell me you ca n't raise your prices by $ 200 when your competitors are all over the board   i guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up the cost of a roof is raised no second thought    the problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate   they are no longer competitive if they give a raise they are no longer competitive

first you need to be aware that the credit score reported by mint is equifax credit score equifax credit score like fico vantagescore and others is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available   every score is calculated with a different formula and can vary from each other widely   lenders almost exclusively only use fico scores so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use second understand that the advice you see from places like mint and credit karma will almost always tell you that you do n't have enough credit card accounts   the reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications   they have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards finally realize that credit score is just a number and is only useful for a limited number of things   higher is better to a point and after that you get no benefit from increasing your score    my advice to you is this do n't stress out about your credit score especially a free score reported by credit karma or mint   if you really have a desire to find out your score you can pay fico to get your actual score but it 's not cheap   you can also sometimes get your fico score by applying for a loan and asking the lender   i last saw my fico scores there were three one from each credit bureau when i applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free   but honestly knowing your score does n't do much for you as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait do n't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry   the thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time   despite what you commonly read about credit scores i 'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts   at the time i applied for my last mortgage i only had 2 open credit cards still true and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old   the average of my 3 scores was just over 800   but i 've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now   only get credit cards that you actually want and close the ones you do n't want

can you deduct interest paid to your father on your personal income taxes interest paid on passive investments can be deducted from the amount earned by that investment as an investment expense as long as the amount earned is greater than the total paid for the interest expense also beware if the amount of interest paid is greater than the yearly gift tax exclusion as the irs might interpret this as a creative way of giving gifts to your father without paying gift tax do you pay taxes on the interest you pay   no because is an expense not income you would not count interest paid to him as taxable income does your father owe taxes on the interest he collects from you yes that is income to him and the last question you did n't ask but i expect it is implied do you owe taxes on the quarterly profits yes that is income to you    the forbes article how to arrange a loan between family members is a bit dated but still a good source of information you really should write a formal note signed by both you and your father indicating the amount borrowed the interest rate you are paying on that amount and when the loan will be repaid if your father has set the interest rate too low this could also be considered a gift to you though we would really be talking about large amounts of money to hit the gift tax limit on interest alone

as your question is written now it looks like you have a typo   your stated apr is = not as you 've written   i ran the numbers that you gave accounting for the typo through the formula at wikipedia and got $ month which will round to $ for most payments   that does n't match the number that you computed or the number on your til maybe you also the result of your calculation i agree that it 's unlikely that this is just a calculation error by the mortgage company although i would n't completely rule it out   are you paying anything else like a property tax escrow   i did n't pull a blank til form to see what might go into the monthly payment line that you showed but in many cases you do pay more than just principle and interest each month not sure if that gets reflected at that point on the form though

i think this thread got a bit off topic   the point is that we 've decided as a nation that we want to guarantee a basic level of healthcare as established by government programs   companies like wal mart take advantage of that paying low wages and assuming employees will utilize the government assistance   the take away is that that 's a little goofy and we should just fix our fucking healthcare system   as for wal mart   it 's complicated   they 've accomplished huge gains in efficiency arguably accomplishing more for the environment than any other company not to mention their moves towards sustainable fish etc   at the same time the lawsuit alleging gender discrimination seemed not without merit the folks in charge are occasionally aggressively socially conservative and their march to the bottom for prices has induced quality suppliers to provide lower quality products specifically to be sold in wal mart their brand name and their products after being suckered in by the big sales numbers

the bottom line is that you are kind of a terrible customer for them    granted you are far better than one that does not pay his bills but you are probably in the tier right above that rewards cards are used to lure the unorganized into out of control interest rates and late payments   these people are capital one 's and others best customers   they have traded hundreds of dollars in interest payments for a couple of dollars in rewards   the cc company says   you on the other hand cut into their meager profits from fees collected from your transactions   why should they help you make more money   why should they further cut into your profits response to comment given your comment i think the bottom line is a matter of perspective   you seem like a logical altruistic type person who probably seeks a win win situation in business dealings   this differs from cc companies they operate to seek one thing   btw the terrible customer remark should be taken as a compliment    after you get past the marketing lies you begin to see what reward programs and zero percent financing is all about   how do most people end up with interest rates   they started with a zero percent balance loan and was late for a payment reward cards work a bit differently   studies show that people tend to spend about 17 more when they use a reward card   i 've caught myself ordering an extra or beer and have subsequently stopped using a reward card for things i can make a decision at the time of purchase   for people with tight budgets this leads to debt my meager profits paragraph makes sense when you understand the onerous nature of cc companies   they are not interested in earning 2 on purchases charge 3 and give back 1 for basically free money   you rightly see this as what should be a win win for all parties involved   thus the meager in quotation marks   cc companies are willing to give back 1 and charge 3 if you then pay 15 or more on your balance some may disagree with me on the extracting nature of cc companies but they are wrong   i like him as an actor but i do n't believe samuel jackson 's lines

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government â€™s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government â€™s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

from hmrc note that the rule is when a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings this is not necessarily the same as the date on which an employee acquires a right to be paid for example an employee 's terms of service may provide for the employee to receive a bonus for the year to 31 december 2004 payable on 30 june 2005 if the employee is still in the service of the employer on 31 december 2004 if the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 december 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 june 2005 so paye applies to it on 30 june 2005 and it is for the date that matters is the date the employee is entitled to be paid the bonus   but why are you worried about paying tax that is your employer 's responsibility and they will do it for you ask you firm 's finance department also for further clarification hmrc are not an organization to mess with they will tie up your life in knots

you 're right the asset allocation is one fundamental thing you want to get right in your portfolio   i agree 110   if you really want to understand asset allocation i suggest any and all of the following three books all by the same author william j. bernstein they are excellent and yes i 've read each   from a theory perspective and being about asset allocation specifically the intelligent asset allocator is a good choice   whereas the next two books are more accessible and more complete covering topics including investor psychology history financial products you can use to implement a strategy etc   got the time read them all i finished reading his latest book the investor 's manifesto two weeks ago   here are some choice quotes from chapter 3 the nature of the portfolio that address some of the points you 've asked about   all emphasis below is mine page 74 the good news is the asset allocation    process is not really that hard   the    investor only makes two important    decisions page 76 rather younger investors should own a    higher portion of stocks because they    have the ability to apply their    regular savings to the markets at    depressed prices   more precisely    young investors possess more human capital than financial capital    that is their total future earnings    dwarf their savings and investments     from a financial perspective human    capital looks like a bond whose    coupons escalate with inflation page 78 the most important asset allocation    decision is the overall stock bind    mix start with age = bond allocation    rule of thumb i.e. because the younger you are you already have bond like income from anticipated employment earnings the older you get the less bond like income you have in your future so buy more bonds in your portfolio he also mentions adjusting that with respect to one 's risk tolerance   if you ca n't take the ups and downs of the market adjust the stock portion down up to 20 less if you can stomach the risk without a problem adjust the stock portion up up to 20 more page 86 in reference to a specific example where two assets that and are    purchased in a 50/50 split and adjusted back to targets this process called rebalancing    provides the investor with an    automatic buy low sell high bias that over the long run usually    but not always improves returns page 87 the essence of portfolio construction    is the combination of asset classes    that move in different directions at    least some of the time finally this gem on pages 88 and 89 is there a way of scientifically picking the very best future    allocation which offers the maximum    return for the minimum risk   no but    people still try Â      continues with description of    markowitz 's mean variance analysis    technique Â   it took    investment professionals quite a while    to realize that limitation of    mean variance analysis and other    black box techniques for allocating    assets i could go on quoting relevant pieces he even goes into much detail on constructing an asset allocation suitable for a large portfolio containing a variety of different stock asset classes but i suggest you read the book

if the share is listed on a stock exchange that creates liquidity and orderly sales with specialist market makers such as the nyse there will always be a counterparty to trade with though they will let the price rise or fall to meet other open interest   on other exchanges or in closely held or private equity scenarios this is not necessarily the case nasdaq has market maker firms that maintain the bid ask spread and can do the same thing with their own inventory as the specialists but are not required to by the brokerage rules as the nyse brokers are   the nyse has listing requirements of at least 1.1 million shares so there will not be a case with only 100 shares on this exchange

the question do they is a fair one but the answer we can only observe the past and that 's what they did may not be so satisfying to you   it 's safe to say that any longer term view of any market will show far less volatility than a short one it only takes a glance at the return of the 2000 's   2009    2008   2007         2006   2005      2004    2003     2002       2001 2000      for the s&p to see that in an awful decade containing and that the full decade was only down 9 in total or just less than 1 per year compounded i 'm not predicting any particular returns forward just noting this is how the math works   dca performs well through such a decade better than in a rising one you are offered the opportunity to buy into a market selling below the long term trend   added note in response to 's answer below on the linked article i see where the author cites who clearly made a logical error he concludes that since a 20 month s&p put costs triple what a 2.3 mo put costs that there 's more risk the market falls over the longer period not less american options can be sold or exercised at any time if a 2 year option were cheaper than a 2 month option no one would buy the shorter term it 's pretty simple that the options pricing models take time into account and their value put or call increases along with the time till expiration   on a lighter note when i take the s&p data for 1871 2012 i know no s&p back then but it 's schiller 's data i get average 40 year returns of similar to the author 's conclusion $ 1 k growing to $ but the standard deviation is 28 so the high end of + 1 is $ 72 k not the author 's $ although the low end 44 comes close to his $ 14 k figure $ 16 k is a long term return which today does n't look bad when the article was written the author was looking at a 6 short term risk free rate

i 'd worry about being robbed or losing the money en route is it likely probably not but wow i would n't want to lose serious money in one shot i have fond memories of the time i was serving as treasurer for a non profit organization and i was taking $ 30,000 in contributions to the bank as i walked across the parking lot with all that money in my brief case i thought i would really hate to be robbed right now when i 've moved long distances in the past i 've simply written myself a check from my old account and then deposited that amount to my new account these days i presume i 'd do an electronic transfer i live in the us so i do n't know what the conventions are in europe but around here 5 would be an outrageous fee i once paid $ 20 for an electronic transfer of around $ 3,000 and i considered that an excessive fee i can understand the bank charging a few bucks but i 'd check around if there are not other banks with more reasonable fees

why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because you trust management to use those shares wisely what it comes down to is management is asking for money while it may not be cash they 're asking for it has the same effect before you approve this you have to evaluate the request similarly to how a bank would evaluate a loan request and ask if you approve of their reasons for needing the money and if you think that it will be used to increase the value of the company making your shares more valuable in the process

i actually think mcdonald 's tastes fine since my expectations are in line with the price of the meal i do n't expect it to taste as good as a more expensive restaurant 's offerings nor do i expect it to taste as good as a home cooked meal as both have higher costs than mcdonald 's to clarify in the case of home cooked meals the cost is time   at the point at which i have made the decision to grab mcdonald 's for dinner the alternatives were too costly i like many americans am busy and am unable or unwilling to find the time to prepare a proper meal on numerous occasions at other times my decision is different as some days i have more time or more money to go with something better   i do n't think mcdonald 's can really objectively be considered barely qualifying as food as food tastes and health decisions are subjective one decent but not definitive proxy as is often the case with subjective matters is popularity mcdonald 's is very popular while this is n't an argument in and of itself it should remind you that taste in food is indeed a subjective opinion   i just plain do n't understand why so many people despise mcdonald 's it 's a fast food joint that some people like and some who cares i do n't particularly like vegan food but i do n't take pleasure in seeing a vegan restaurant shut down as an aside vegan cookies are delicious   if folks want to talk about say mcdonald 's business practices labor relations or environmental record that 's another story but mcdonald 's tastes like shit type comments typically result in a storm of upvotes that i have trouble understanding   finally it seems to be overlooked that mcdonald 's and many other american fast food companies are different abroad when compared to restaurants at home in america eating mcdonald 's is very much a quick and dirty affair but it widely varies from country to country with from what i can tell american mcdonald 's setting something of a floor as far as mcdonald 's dining experiences go

as a resident of new york state you will in addition to the federal income tax handled by the irs be responsible for state and local income taxes for new york the state tax forms are also used to determine your new york city tax if hr was either not aware of the local tax requirement for new york or you filled out the new york state version of the w-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for new york state the refund from the irs is not dependent on the refund owe status for state and local taxes it is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city that tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to new york of course if you do itemize what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form if you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the irs seizing a federal refund but that does n't happen right away

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

credit cards typically charge interest on money you borrow from them   they work in one of two ways most cards will not charge you any interest if you pay the balance in full each month   you typically have around 25 days the grace period to pay that off   if that 's the case then you will use your credit card without any cost to yourself however if you do not pay it in full by that point then you will owe 19.9 interest on the balance typically from the day you charged the payment so retroactively   you 'll also immediately begin owing interest on anything else you charge typically even if you do then pay the next month the entire balance on time   it 's typically a daily rate which means that the annual rate apr is divided into its daily rate think the apr divided by 365 though it 's a bit different than that since it 's the rate which would be 19.9 annualized when you realize interest is paid on interest    say in your case it 's 0.05 daily that means each day 0.05 is added to your balance due   if you charged $ 1000 on day one and never made a payment but never had to ignore penalties here you 'd owe $ at the end of the year paying $ 199 interest 19.9 1000 note that your interest is calculated on the daily balance not on your actual credit limit if you only charge $ 100 you 'd owe $ interest not $ 199 also note that this simplifies what they 're actually doing   they often use things like average daily balance calculations and such to work out actual interest charged they tend to be similar to what i 'm describing but usually favor the bank a bit or are simpler to calculate finally some credit cards do not have a grace period   in the us most do but not all in other countries it may be less common   some simply charge you interest from day one as far as standard purchases that means buying services or goods   using your credit card for cash advances i.e. receiving cash from an atm using those checks they mail you or for cash like purchases for example at a casino are often under a different scheme they may have the same rate or a different rate   they likely incur interest from the moment cash is produced no grace period and they may involve additional fees   never use cash advances unless you absolutely can not avoid it

first are you sure that no interest accrues on the student loans until six months after you finish your studies my understanding is that you have to start paying back the student loans six months after leaving the university but that does n't mean no interest accrues in the meantime my concern about student loans is that life happens and when it happens in an unexpected way the powers of the student loan companies exceed pretty much everybody else 's with the possible exception of the irs if you are in a position to be able to pay cash for the tuition then i would cut back the lifestyle scrimp as much as i can and pay cash you 'll be in a much better position afterwards for starters you wo n't have a student loan payment which means you 're in a much better position financially than most of your peers and have a lot more options open plus you 're not carrying around a mortgage before you even bought a house

the owner of a long futures contract does not receive dividends hence this is a disadvantage compared to owning the underlying stock if the dividend is increased and the future price would not change there is an arbitrage possibility for the sake of simplicity assume that the stock suddenly starts paying a dividend and that the risk free rate is zero so interest does not play a role one can expect that the future price is equal to the stock price before the dividend if the future price would not change an investor could buy the stock and short a futures contract on the stock at expiration he has to deliver the stock for the price set in the contract which is under the assumptions here equal to the price he bought the stock for but because he owned the stock he receives the announced dividend hence he can make a risk free profit consisting of the if interest do play a role the argument is similar

none of your options seem mutually exclusive   ordinarily nothing stops you from participating in your 401(k opening an ira qualifying for your company 's pension and paying off your debts except your ability to pay for all this stuff   moreover you can open an ira anywhere scottrade vanguard etrade etc and freely invest in vanguard mutual funds as well as those of other companies you are n't normally locked in to the funds of your ira provider consider a traditional ira   to me your marginal tax rate of 25 does n't seem that great   if i were in your shoes i would be more likely to contribute to a traditional ira instead of a roth   this will save you taxes today and you can put the extra 25 of $ 5,500 toward your loans   yes you will be taxed on that money when you retire but i think it 's likely your rate will be lower than 25   moreover when you are retired you will already own a house and have paid off all your debt hopefully   you kind of need money now   between your current tax rate and your need for money now i 'd say a traditional makes good sense   buy whatever funds you want   if you want a single cheap whole market fund just buy vtsax   you will need a minimum of $ 10 k to get in so until then you can buy the etf version vti   personally i would contribute enough to your 401(k to get the match and anything else to an ira usually they have more and better investment options   if you max that out go back to the 401(k your investment mix is n't that important   recent research into target date funds puts them in a poor light since there is n't a good benchmark for a target date fund the managers tend to buy whatever they feel like and it may not be what you would prefer if you were choosing   however the fund you mention has a pretty low expense ratio and the difference between that and your own allocation to an equity index fund or a blend of equity and bond funds is small in expectation   plus you can change your allocation whenever you want you are not locked in the investment options you mention are reasonable enough that the difference between portfolios is not critical   more important is optimizing your taxes and paying off your debt in the right order your interest rates matter more than term does paying off debt with more debt will help you if the new debt has a lower interest rate and it wo n't if it has a higher interest rate   normally speaking longer term debt has a higher interest rate   for that reason shorter term debt if you can afford it is generally better   be cold and calculating with your debt   always pay off highest interest rate debt first and never pay off cheap debt with expensive debt if the 25 year debt option is lower than all your other interest rates and will allow you to pay off higher interest rate debt faster it 's a good idea   otherwise it most likely is not   do not make debt decisions for psychological reasons e.g. simplicity   instead always chose the option that maximizes your ultimate wealth

people are trying ideas like this actually   though they generally are n't very public about it   while keshlam ventures into hyperbole when mentioning watson he is certainly correct human language parsing is a extremely hard problem while it is not always true that the big players will know before the news sometimes that would qualify as insider trading   the volume spike that you mention generally comes as the news arrives to the major and minor players   so if you have an algorithm run after the volume spike the price will likely have adjusted significantly already you can try to avoid this by constantly scanning for news on a set of stocks however this becomes an even harder problem   or maybe by becoming more specific and parsing known important and specific news sources farm report for instance and trying to do so faster than anyone else   these are some methods people use to not be too late

if i understand your question you 're misunderstanding the buy sell spread and at least in this instance seem to be in an unfortunate situation where the spread is quite large the polish zloty gbp ideal exchange rate is around   thus when actually exchanging currency you should expect to pay a bit more than zloty to get one pound sterling and you should expect to get a bit less than zloty in exchange for one pound sterling   that 's because you 're giving the bank its cut both for operations and so that it has a reason to hold onto some zloty that it ca n't lend out   it sounds like barclay 's has a large spread buy sell   i would guess british banks do n't need all that many zloty so you have a higher spread than you would for usd or eur other currency exchange companies or banks particularly those who are in the primary business of converting money may have a smaller spread and be more willing to do it for you   also it looks like the polish banks are willing to do it at a better rate certainly they 're giving you more zloty for one pound sterling so it seems likely the other way would be better as well though since they 're a polish bank it 's certainly easier for them to give you zloty so this may be less true   barclay 's is certainly giving you a better deal on pounds for a zloty than they are zloty for a pound in terms of how far off their spread is from the ideal

when you start living in us it does n't actually matter what was your credit history in another country your credit history in us is tied to your ssn social security number which will be awarded once you are in the country legally and apply for it getting an ssn also does n't guarantee you nothing and you have to build your credit history slowly opening a checking or savings account will not help you in building a credit history you need to have some type of credit account credit card car loan mortgage etc linked to your ssn to start building your credit history when you are new to us you probably wo n't find any bank that will give you a credit card as you have no credit history one alternative is to apply for a secured credit card a secured credit card is one you get by putting money or paying money to a bank and open a credit card against that money thereby the bank can be secure that they wo n't lose any money once you have that you can use that to build up your credit history slowly and once you have a good credit history and score apply for regular credit card or apply for a car loan mortgage etc when i came to us 8 years ago my credit history was nothing even though i had pretty good balance and credit history back in my country i applied for secured credit card by paying $ 500 to a bank which got acquired by capitalone got it approved and used it for everything for three years i applied for other cards in the mean time but got rejected every time finally got approved for a regular credit card after three years and in one year added a mortgage and car loan which helped me to get a decent score now and yes a good credit score is important and essential for renting an apartment leasing a car getting a credit card etc   but normally your employer can always arrange for an apartment given your situation or you need to share apartment with someone else you can rent a car without and credit score but need a valid us international drivers license and a credit card best option will be to open a secured credit card and start building your credit when your wife and family arrives they also will be assigned individual ssn and can start building their credit history themselves please keep in mind that credit score and credit history is always individual here

the euro is a common currency between various countries in europe   this means that individual countries give up their traditional sovereign control of their own currency and cede that control to the eu such a system has many advantages but it also means that individual countries can not deal with their unique situations as easily   for instance if the us were a part of the eu then the fed could n't issue $ 600b the way they are to bolster the economy the danger to the euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively   if a major country withdraws its participation it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively   as more countries withdraw a shared currency becomes less and less appealing

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

if you are considering this to be an entry for your business this is how you would handle it you said you were making a balance sheet for monthly expenses so on the balance sheet you would be debiting cash for the income statement side you would be crediting owner 's equity to balance the equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity so if you deposited $ 100 to your account the equation would be affected thus $ 100 in assets debit to cash account = 0 liabilities $ 100 credit to owner 's equity it is correctly stated above from the bank 's perspective that they would be crediting you account with $ 100 and any outflow from the bank account would be debiting your account

you have a large number of possible choices to make and a lot of it does depend upon what interests you when you are older the first thing to note is the difference between isas and pension contribution schemes tax wise which is of course the taxation point when you contribute to your pensions scheme it is done before taxation which is why when you draw from your pension scheme you have to pay income tax conversely your isa is something you contribute to after you have already paid income tax so besides the 10 tax on dividends if you hold any assets which may them it is tax free when you draw on it regardless of how much you have accrued over the years   now when it comes to the question what is the best way to save the answer is almost certainly going to be filling your pension to the point where you 're going to retire just on the edge of the limit and then putting the rest into isas this way you will not be paying the higher rates of tax associated with breaking the lifetime limit but also get maximum contributions into your various schemes there is an exception to this of course which is the return on investment if you do not have access to a sipp self invested personal pension you may be able to receive a far higher return on investment when using a stocks shares isa in which case the fact that you have to pay taxes prior to funding it may not make a significant difference the other issue you have as others have mentioned is rent   while now you may be enjoying london it is in my opinion quite likely that will change when you get older london has a very high cost of living even compared to the home counties and many of its benefits are not relevant to someone who is retired when you retire it is quite possible that you will see it fit to take a large sum out of your various savings and purchase a house which means that regardless of how much you are drawing out you will be able to have somewhere to live renting is fine when you are working but when you have a certain amount of admittedly growing funds that have to last you indefinitely who knows if it will last you

there is no interest outstanding per se   there is only principal outstanding   initially principal outstanding is simply your initial loan amount the first two sections discuss the math needed just some arithmetic the interest that you owe is typically calculated on a monthly basis   the interested owed formula is simply where p is the principal outstanding i is your annual interest and you 're dividing by 12 to turn annual to monthly with a monthly payment take out interest owed   what you have left gets applied into lowering your principal outstanding   if your actual monthly payment is less than the interest owed then you have negative amortization where your principal outstanding goes up instead of down regardless of how the monthly payment comes about eg prepay underpay no payment you just apply these two calculations above and you 're set   the sections below will discuss these cases in differing payments in detail for a standard 30 year fixed rate loan the monthly payment is calculated to pay off the entire loan in 30 years   if you pay exactly this amount every month your loan will be paid off including the principal in 30 years   the breakdown of the initial payment will be almost all interest as you have noticed   of course there is a little bit of principal in that payment or your principal outstanding would not decrease and you would never pay off the loan if you pay any amount less than the monthly payment you extend the duration of your loan to longer than 30 years   how much less than the monthly payment will determine how much longer you extend your loan   if it 's a little less you may extend your loan to 40 years   it 's possible to extend the loan to any duration you like by paying less   mathematically this makes sense but legally the loan department will say you 're in breach of your contract let 's pay a little less and see what happens   if you pay exactly the interest owed = you would have an infinite duration loan where your principal outstanding would always be the same as your initial principal or the initial amount of your loan    if you pay less than the interest owed you will actually owe more every month   in other words your principal outstanding will increase every month   this is called negative amortization   of course this includes the case where you make zero payment   you will owe more money every month of course for most loans you can not pay less than the required monthly payments   if you do you are in default of the loan terms if you pay more than the required monthly payment you shorten the duration of your loan   your principal outstanding will be less by the amount that you overpaid the required monthly payment by   for example if your required monthly payment is $ 200 and you paid $ 300 $ 100 will go into reducing your principal outstanding in addition to the bit in the $ 200 used to pay down your principal outstanding   of course if you hit the lottery and overpay by the entire principal outstanding amount then you will have paid off the entire loan in one shot when you get to non standard contracts a loan can be structured to have any kind of required monthly payments   they do n't have to be fixed    for example there are balloon loans where you have small monthly payments in the beginning and large monthly payments in the last year    is the math any different   not really you still apply the one important formula interest owed = on a monthly basis   then you break down the amount you paid for the month into the interest owed you just calculated and principal   you apply that principal amount to lowering your principal outstanding for the next month supposing that what you have posted is accurate the most likely scenario is that you have a structured 5 year car loan where your monthly payments are smaller than the required fixed monthly payment for a 5 year loan so even after 2 years you owe as much or more than you did in the beginning   that means you have some large balloon payments towards the end of your loan   all of this is just part of the contract and has nothing to do with your prepay maybe i 'm incorrect in my thinking but i have a question about    prepaying a loan when you take out a mortgage on a home or a car    loan it is my understanding that for the first years of payment you    are paying mostly interest correct so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty    if i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the    16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to    the bank and i 'm only paying primarily principle for the remainder of    the loan incorrect   it seems counter intuitive but even in year 16 about 53 of your monthly payment still goes to interest   it is hard to see this unless you try to do the calculations yourself in a spreadsheet if suddenly i come into a large sum of money and decide i want to pay    off the mortgage in the 16th year but the bank has already received    all the interest computed for 30 years should n't the bank    the interest for 16 years and then recalculate what 's actually owed in    effect on a 16 year loan not a 30 year loan it is my understanding    that the bank does n't do this what they do is just tell you the    balance owed under the 30 year agreement and that 's your payoff    amount your last sentence is correct   the payoff amount is simply the principal outstanding plus any interest from that you owe   in your example of trying to payoff the rest of your 30 year loan in year 16 you will owe around 68 of your original loan amount that seems unfair should n't the loan be recalculated as a 16 year    loan which it actually has become in fact you do have the equivalent of a 15 year loan 30 at about 68 of your initial loan amount   if you refinanced that 's exactly what you would see   in other words for a 30y loan at 5 for $ 10,000 you have monthly payments of $ which is exactly the same as a loan at 5 for $ your principal outstanding after 15 years of payments which would also have monthly payments of $ a few years ago i had a 5 year car    loan i wanted to prepay it after 2 years and i asked this question to    the lender i expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car    loan since it did n't go the full 5 years they basically told me i was    crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan    i did n't prepay it because of this that is the wrong reason for not prepaying   i suspect you have misunderstood the terms of the loan look at the variable monthly payments section above for a discussion    the best thing to do with all loans is to read the terms carefully and do the calculations yourself in a spreadsheet   if you are able to get the cashflows spelled out in the contract then you have understood the loan

ah i just read a fascinating comparison between gambling investing and trading on either /r /r or maybe /r it reminded me a lot of the investors in trump 's projects    my take on it is anyone putting money into one of his projects does so with the awareness of his track record and is simply playing the game at that level if they somehow have n't protected themselves against the possible loss of their investment that would be as silly as failing to carry health homeowner vehicle insurance    one obvious response is to sue alleging that trump is evil and that he intentionally stole money from his investors finance at that level is a strategy game he happens to be a skilled player and especially adapt at extracting himself from seemingly losing positions personally i would n't play at his table

two years ago i wrote an article titled student loans and your first mortgage in response to this exact question posed by a fellow blogger   the bottom line is that the loan payment does n't lower your borrowing power as it fits in the slice between 28 total housing cost and 38 total monthly debt burden when applying for a loan   but the $ 20 k is 20 down on $ 100 k worth of house with median home prices in the us in the mid high $ you 're halfway there   in the end it 's not about finance it 's a question of how badly you want to buy a house if i got along with the parents i 'd stay as long as i was welcome and save every dollar i could save for retirement save for as large a downpayment as you can and after you buy the house pay the student loan aggressively i moved out the week after i graduated

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

defined benefit pension funds will typically target treasuries + a spread that depends on how well funded the plan is and the duration of the liabilities so for example if a db fund is 90 funded meaning assets are 90 of liabilities and the liabilities have a duration of 20 years they will target the 20 year treasury rate + a spread that will bring the plan to just over 100 funded in around 20 years this spread will usually be much lower than 8 p.a obviously it 's much more complicated than this but hopefully this gives a general idea

you mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance while others have fairly high balances i would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower apr you can transfer the balance to those cards with lower apr now if those 0 balance cards do not have lower apr closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance but to my understanding if you keep the payments good and on time that effect is only temporary and therefore you can definitely close them   do n't forget paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings and you can focus more on that instead also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over extension therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance

what the hell is fair inequality      in order for inequality to be justified there needs to be constant growth in the economy such that the ones pulling away and getting rich are producing better products services or inventing more efficient ways to bring products to market    unfortunately more of the rich are turning to rent seeking methods to increase their wealth thus it becomes zero sum at that point because they are taking more wealth for themselves without actually adding any value economically to society      currently our growth is anemic yet the very wealthy keeps pulling farther and farther away from the pack as far as total wealth   this is why as they get richer the rest of us are getting poorer

lenders may sell your mortgage to other lenders for a fee   for example   your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment   for your lender that 's a quick profit for the new owner of your mortgage that 's long term returns for a one time fee   for your lender that is forgoing long term returns for short term gains and transfer of risk in case you default    very similar to how bonds work in a stock exchange what does this mean to you nothing   you will still keep making payments to your original lender    what does transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean it means when you are asked about ownership details regarding your mortgage and this could be in tax forms or refinancing etc you would enter your original lender 's information and not mac 's pro tip there are lots of scams based on this   you might receive an official looking letter in mail claiming your loan has been sold and you should start making payments to the new owner do not fall for this call your original lender use the phone number from your loan papers not mail you received and verify this information    and if this were to happen your original lender would always inform you first    and hey congrats on your new home

this does n't look particularly unreasonable but a few notes it 's a little misleading to say that 45 of his paycheck is gone roughly 6 of his gross pay went to his 401(k that money is still his he 's just chosen to save it in a particular way depending on the choices he 's made for his retirement savings he 'll also reduce his tax bill right now and/or during retirement by making these contributions some of the other costs also go to social programs that may pay you back granted they may not always be as good as those in europe but it 's not that you 'd get nothing in return in any case $ 130k year is certainly a lot on a global scale but san francisco is a very expensive city and housing costs in sf have risen a lot lately you 've nicely summed up why a lot of families unfortunately leave the city

nearly every country has its own exchange because so many countries have their own currency and currency every part of an exchange 's business    generally an exchange will support transaction and settlement only in local currency   securities except those that explicitly enable fx trading are denominated and will trade in a single you can only buy a share of ibm in u.s. dollars   securities trading always seeks to be a clean scalable process and adding cross currency translation to the mix would just complicate things   so it 's one exchange one currency in most countries citizens and even businesses are largely restricted to having bank accounts in local currency   there are various political reasons for this but there it is   it is difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreign denominated currency   a public company headquartered in a given country will be required to publish financial statements in local currency will be more likely to do business with the local and businesses in that currency and so will likely look for investors from that same which generally means listing in local currency which means on an exchange in that country there are exceptions of course   big multinationals do business all over the world and many seek investors all over the world as well   mechanisms have been created to permit this american depositary receipts or adrs for example   but once again cross currency translation makes things more complicated so adrs and their like are only practical for very big international players as to why there may be many exchanges in a single country imo nick r has it right   read flash boys many market makers profit from trading between exchanges and so have an interest in there being many of them   and in the u.s. regulators have expressed an interest in innovation in the exchange space and so permit them   there is also an argument to be made against having a single too big to fail exchange just like the argument for banks but i would n't call that a reason for the current state of affairs

is this amount an adequate starting amount to begin investing with yes you can open an account at a brokerage with this amount i 'm not sure i would invest in individual stocks at this point which services should i use to start buying shares currently my bank offers this service but i 'm willing to use other sources i ca n't make uk specific recommendations but i 'd compare your bank 's fees to those of a discount broker as well as the variety and level of service available i would like to regularly increase the amount invested in shares is it worth doing this in say Â£ 200 increments take a look at the fees associated with each investment divide the fee by the increment to see what percent you 'll lose to fees commissions keep in mind that you have to gain more than that percentage to start earning a positive return on your investment if you have access to fee free automatic mutual fund investments and you can commit to the Â£ 200 amount on a regular basis going forward then this can be a completely free way of making these incremental investments see also this answer on dollar cost averaging and my comment on the other answer on that question for how fees impact returns when buying shares should i focus on say two or three companies or diversify more i would diversify into two or three different index funds read up on asset allocation for example you might invest 1/3 of your balance into s&p 500 index fund bond index fund and msci eafe index fund but that 's just a rough example and not necessarily good for you i highly recommend the intelligent asset allocator by william bernstein for excellent info on diversification and asset allocation

like keshlam mentioned insurance and investment should not generally be mixed term insurance is the best and cheapest insurance this would work out better than money back option you have i.e. take a term insurance for the same amount invest the difference between the premium of term insurance and money back option even if you invest this difference in bank fd 's the return is much more than what your money back policy gives pension plans are not advisable although has in recent times streamlined quite a bit of it there is still some amount that goes into commission plus the returns from annuity providers the yearly payment you get after retirement is less than what you get from fd 's i.e. currently the annuity rates are in the range of 5 6 and one year fd 's are in the range of 7 8 the only reason one need to go with pension plan or money bank plan would be if one is not financially disciplined or ca n't   reconcile to the fact that term insurance in spite of not giving any returns is much better

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

small cap and mid cap shares tend to outperform large cap shares in a bull market but they tend to underperform large cap shares in a bear market since the stock markets tend to go up in the long term this suggests that a low cost small and mid cap index etf should offer the best long term returns    having said that we are currently in a mature bull market having experienced over seven years without a bear market   if a bearish outlook is something you worry about then perhaps a broad market index which will be heavily weighted towards large cap shares may be a better choice for you at this time with an eye toward switching to small and mid cap indices during the next bear market

you ca n't change the w2 the employer issues it and sends it to the irs you can not affect it in any way the employer reported correctly you did contribute $ in 2015 you then withdrew the excess in 2016 and did it timely so it is not taxable in 2016 however the excess contribution should be added back to your wages on your tax return the way to do it is to add it to the taxable wages amount reported on w2 box 1 and attach a statement explaining that the amount added is the excess contribution you then put the corrected amount in the right place on your tax return line 7 on the form 1040 adding the difference to misc income line 21 is ok too it 's the same effect you will then need to check with your payroll that they 're aware that the excess was deposited back on the account of the next year and adjust their reports accordingly otherwise you 'll end up with excess contribution again

in comparing housing to investing in a stock market the author claims housing is a poor investment because houses depreciate   he 's forgetting about the land component   the improvement on the land is only a portion of the value and it 's the only part that depreciates   in markets where the prices have risen significantly the value is largely in the land    land has a finite supply which is even more evident when we are looking at land located where people actually want to live   while strong banking controls kept canada from suffering the same crash in the second half of the 2000 's availability of land where people actually want to live is likely responsible for a lot of the divergence between the us and canada   most canadians live within 100 of the border between the two countries as the weather makes living more northern undesirable   the us has lots of available land in places with a better climate than a lot of canada   sure there 's some highly desirable places to live in the us where prices have skyrocketed but the scarcity of desirable land affects all of canada and is not going to go away

because my accountant said i 'm in the 28 bracket and need more write offs when i hear someone say this i tell them to get a new accountant advisor tax guy   the benefit if any is the fact that if and only if a hat tip to you are already itemizing your deductions   it means that for me my 3.5 mortgage is really costing me   the only effect of this is the when i line up my debts the mortgage might fall to a lower priority for payback this is where there 's a balance between the choice of a robust emergency fund earning close to 0 today or using those funds to pay the mortgage at an accelerated rate   if the sentiment expressed by the question implies that one should carry a mortgage needed or not it really comes down the a question of risk over the long term i do n't suggest that people take a mortgage today to invest in the market a zero return as we just saw in the will show you that the 10 market return is an average over the very long term fwiw the period returned and 2 years short of the 10 few have the discipline to patiently wait out the dips and see the returns i quoted   that said the fact that the interest is deductible is a small factor given the low rates we are currently enjoying   each of the points above can be expanded into its own answer a great question with not so simple answers

i would n't say you should have any particular limit but it ca n't hurt to have a higher limit i 'd always accept the increase when offered and feel free to request it sometimes just make sure you find out if it will be a hard or soft inquiry and pass on the hard inquires from my own experience there does n't seem to be any or reason to the increases i believe each bank acts differently based on the customer 's credit income and even the bank 's personal quotas or goals for that period here is some anecdotal evidence of this i got my first credit card when i was 18 years old and a freshman in college it had a limit of $ 500 at the time i never asked for a credit line increase but always accepted when offered one and sometimes they did n't even ask and in the last 20 years it worked it 's way up to $ 25k. another card with the same bank went from $ 5 k to $ 15 k in about 10 years about 6 years ago i added two cards one with a $ 5 k limit and one with a $ 3 k limit i did n't ask for increases on those either and today the 5 k is up to $ 22 k and the 3 k is still at $   an even larger disparity exists on the business side years ago i had two business credit cards with different banks at one point in time both were maxed out for about 6 months and only minimums were being paid bank 1 started lowering my credit limit as i started to pay off the card eventually prompting me to cancel the card when it was paid in full at the same time bank 2 kept raising my limit to give me more breathing room in case i needed it obviously bank 1 did n't want my business and bank 2 did less than a year later both cards were paid off in full and you can guess which bank i chose to do all of my business with after that

i do n't know the details of whether or not you should pay this money or who is at fault but clearly you believe that you do not owe the money and the bank investigation seems to agree with you since they gave you your money back   since you have your money and they have n't sued you the only issue yet remaining is your credit report here is what i would suggest   first make sure you check all three credit reports to see which reports the collection appears on then dispute the report with each credit bureau reporting the problem there is an article on creditkarma that explains the process when you file your dispute with the credit they will investigate this usually involves asking the creditor for proof of the debt and if you did n't sign anything they probably wo n't have any proof hopefully the credit bureaus will come to the same conclusion as the bank did and remove the collection from your credit reports   in my opinion it does n't make sense to pay them now if you do n't believe you owe it paying them wo n't remove all the bad stuff from your credit report but it will improve it and you do n't want to pay them and then immediately sue them   if however the credit bureaus side with the landlord and leave this on your report paying the $ 300 is better on your report than leaving the unpaid debt on there

small purchases will have a disproportionate expense for commissions even a $ 5 trade fee is 5 on a $ 100 purchase so on one hand it 's common to advise individuals just starting out to use mutual funds specifically index funds with low fees on the flip side holding stocks has no annual fee and if you are buying for the long term you may still be better off with an eye toward cost and learn over time   in theory an individual stands a better chance to beat the experts for a number of reasons no shareholders to answer to and the ability to purchase without any disclosure among them in reality most investor lag the average by such a wide margin they 'd be best off indexing and staying in for the long term

i feel that getting money sooner than later is always advantageous if i offered you the choice between getting which option would you take i would take the last option and for the same reason from a purely numbers point of view i would argue that getting paid biweekly is preferable assuming the the annual salary is pro rated fairly and barring any compulsive spending habits your calculations suggest to me that they are trying to answer the question looking at a single year or month or some other fixed amount of time in a vacuum is there any financial benefit to being paid bi weekly over monthly the analysis seems to be focusing on comparing the two pay schedules on a month by month basis noting when one is paid bi weekly some months you get paid more times than the other however one could also compare the two pay schedules on a fortnight by fortnight basis and note that when one is paid monthly many you do n't get paid at all and some you get paid a lot or one could compare the two pay schedules on an hour by hour basis too but in the long run the money adds up to be the same amount i prefer getting it as soon as i can

i 'm sorry but your math is wrong   you are not equally likely to make as much money by waiting for expiration share prices are moving constantly in both directions   very rarely does any stock go either straight up or straight down   consider a stock with a share price of $ 12 today   perhaps that stock is a bad buy and in 1 month 's time it will be down to $ 10   but the market has n't quite up to this yet and over the next week it rallies up to $ 15 if you bought a european option let 's say an at the money call expiring in 1 month at $ 12 on our start date then you lost   your option expired worthless if you bought an american option you could have exercised it when the share price was at $ 15 and made a nice profit keep in mind we are talking about exactly the same stock with exactly the same history over exactly the same time period   the only difference is the option contract   the american option could have made you money if you exercised it at any time during the rally but not the european option you would have been forced to hold onto it for a month and finally let it expire worthless of course that 's not strictly true since the european option itself can be sold while it is in the money but eventually somebody is going to end up holding the bag nobody can exercise it until expiration the difference between an american and european option is the difference between getting n chances to get it right n being the number of days til expiration and getting just one chance   it should be easy to see why you 're more likely to profit with the former even if you ca n't accurately predict price movement

probably the most significant difference is the sword hanging over your head the margin call in a nutshell the lender your broker is going to require you to have a certain amount of assets in your account relative to your outstanding loan balance the minimum ratio of liquid funds in the account to the loan is regulated in the us at 50 for the initial margin and 25 for maintenance margins so here 's where it gets sticky if this ratio gets on the wrong side of the limits the broker will force you to either add more assets cash to your account t or immediately liquidate some of your holdings to remedy the situation assuming you do n't have any enough cash to fix the problem it can effectively force you to sell while your investments are in the tank and lock in a big loss in fact most margin agreements give the brokerage the right to sell your investments without your express consent in these situations in this situation you might not even have the chance to pick which stock they sell source investopedia article the dreaded margin call here 's an example from the article let 's say you    purchase $ 20,000 worth of securities    by borrowing $ 10,000 from your    brokerage and paying $ 10,000 yourself    if the market value of the securities    drops to $ 15,000 the equity in your    account falls to $ 5,000 $ 15,000    $ 10,000 = $ 5,000 assuming a    maintenance requirement of 25 you    must have $ 3,750 in equity in your    account 25 of $ 15,000 = $ 3,750    thus you 're fine in this situation as    the $ 5,000 worth of equity in your    account is greater than the    maintenance margin of $ 3,750 but    let 's assume the maintenance    requirement of your brokerage is 40    instead of 25 in this case your    equity of $ 5,000 is less than the    maintenance margin of $ 6,000 40 of    $ 15,000 = $ 6,000 as a result the    brokerage may issue you a margin call read more

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

if you are buying and selling mutual funds in the same family of funds e.g. vanguard then you can set up an on line account on the vanguard website and it is easy vanguard offers a transaction service that allows you to sell shares of vfinx say and buy shares of say from the proceeds of the sale all in one swell but if you are holding the vfinx shares through your on line account with say etrade then it depends on what services etrade provides to you will it allow doing all that in one transaction or will it wait for the cash to come from vanguard and then send the money back to vanguard to invest in in any case selling vfinx shares and investing the proceeds in shares say   can not be done on the vanguard site only vanguard will send the proceeds of the sale of the vfinx shares only to your bank account not anywhere else you   then need to tell t. rowe price where you presumably have an account already that you want to invest $ x in shares and to withdraw the cash from your bank account if you are doing it all through etrade then the money from the sale of vfinx goes from vanguard to etrade into something called a sweep account or maybe your cash account at etrade and you invest it in after appropriate delays in receiving the money from vanguard into etrade etc if your cash account bank or etrade has enough of a balance you could sell vfinx and buy on the same day where the purchase is made from the money in the cash account and replaced a few days later by the proceeds from vanguard bouncing of checks or inability to act on a hot tip to invest in something in the interim is your problem not the bank 's or etrade 's

accidents and tickets more than 3 years old generally wo n't affect you    i use an insurance broker who shops a bunch of different companies and buys me the best policy he gets a cut as a middle man but saves me more than going direct and gives great advice when i have a question    since you have n't been only your own policy lately it will cost you more than someone with a 3 year history with a perfect record but if you shop around you will find something at a fair price    also your credit score often factors into the price you pay for car insurance also

its important to note that aggression or better yet volatility does not necessarily offer higher returns   one can find funds that have a high beta measure of volatility and lower performance then stock funds with a lower beta    additionally to 's point better performance could be undone by higher fees    age is unimportant when deciding the acceptable volatility   its more important as to when the money is to be available   if there might be an immediate need or even less than a year then stick to a savings account   five years some volatility can be accepted if 10 years or more seek to maximize rate of return for example assume a person is near retirement age   they are expected to have 50 k per year expenses   if they have 250 k wrapped up in cds and savings and another 250 k in some conservative investments they can and should be aggressive with any remaining money      on the contrary a person your age that is savings for a house intends to buy one in three years   savings for the down payment should be pretty darn conservative    something like 75 in savings accounts and maybe 25 in some conservative investments   as the time to buy approaches they can pull the money out of the conservative investments at a optimal time also you should not be investing without an emergency fund in place   get that done first then look to invest if your friend does not understand these basic concepts there is no point in paying for his advice

you may be using the wrong method to get your money back   as others have said this is not a valid use for chargeback that is when a fraudulent charge occurred or when a merchant charges you incorrectly however many cards have various kinds of guarantees one of which might cover this situation particularly in some european countries such as the united kingdom which has section 75 allowing you a recourse services are included with goods   goods are typically the only covered elements in the us though but check your credit card agreement to be sure second you can go through the ftc   they will provide you a sample form letter to request a refund of your money and if the merchant is not cooperative might choose to help you directly especially if many others are in your situation

you can look at the company separately from the ownership the company needs money that it does n't have therefore it needs to borrow money from somewhere or go bankrupt   and if they ca n't get money from their bank then they can of course ask people related to the company like the two shareholders for a loan it 's a loan like every other loan that needs to be repaid how big the loan is does n't depend on the ownership but on how much money each one is willing and capable of giving the loan does n't give them any rights in the company except the right to get their money back with interest in the future   alternatively such a company might have 200 shares and might have given 75 to one owner and 25 to the other owner keeping 100 shares back in that case the shareholders can decide to sell some of these 100 shares i might buy 10 shares for $ 1,000 each so the company has now $ 10,000 cash and i have some ownership of the company about and the 75 and 25 shares have gone down because now they own 75 out of 110 or 25 out of 110 shares i wo n't get the $ 10,000 back ever it 's not a loan but the purchase of part of the company

great idea so lets make trader joes in locations where people need living wages like the ghetto because that has been working /s   you make a store that makes a premium selling to the upper middle class and can afford to pay their workers more because of these better margins from their abnormally higher prices it does n't work in areas where cheap food is a necessity these kinds of stores ca n't sell in all economic classes so these stores giving living wages do n't solve any issues we have regarding wage gentrification does n't work so i do n't see why i keep seeing articles talk about trader joes suddenly solving our minimum wage debate if i see a company that rivals walmart in price yet can give a living wage while still being profitable then we have something costco is what comes to mind and to be honest it 's probably the best example we can take from a good business that is able to give a decent wage for unskilled labor while still being profitable the issue is not everyone can afford to spend $ 100 to buy 20 jars of to save 10 cents a jar to rival walmart 's savings

given that hedge funds and trading firms employ scores of highly    intelligent analysts programmers and managers to game the market    what shot does the average person have at successful investing in the    stock market good question and the existing answers provide valuable insight   i will add one major ingredient to successful investing emotion   the analysts and experts that goldman sachs morgan stanley or the best hedge funds employ may have some of the most advanced analytical skills in the world but knowing and doing still greatly differ   consider how many of these same companies and funds thought real estate was a great buy before the housing bubble   why   fear of missing out what some people call greed one of my friends purchased macy 's and las vegas sands in 2009 at around $ 5 for m and $ 2 for   he never graduated high school so we might foolishly refer to him as below average because he 's not as educated as those individuals at goldman sachs morgan stanley etc   today m sits around $ 40 a share and at around $ 70 those returns in five years the difference   emotion   he holds little attachment to money lives on very little and thus had the freedom to take a chance which to him did n't feel like a chance   in a nutshell his emotions were in the right place and he studied a little bit about investing read two article and took action   most of the people who i know which easily had his wealth and made significantly more than he did did n't take a chance even on an index fund because of their fear of loss i mean everyone knows to buy low right   but how many actually do   so knowing what to do is great just be sure you have the courage to act on what you know

right the definition of made with 100 chicken changes depending on whether that particular company sources soy protein and chicken separately and mixes them vs purchasing it already mixed the consumer does n't care if this particular company is putting the chicken and the soy together all they care about is what 's in the package that 's what i mean by the fact that at some level everything with chicken is made with 100 chicken legally they ca n't say that it 's made with 100 chicken unless one of the items they purchase from a supplier is just chicken but morally biologically and logically it is the same whether they put the chicken into their mixing pot or an upstream supplier does   lets take a concrete example this breakfast products sandwiches smoke chicken sausage egg whites and cheese sandwiches is made with 100 chicken obviously the entire food product is not chicken but i would n't be surprised if someone walking down the aisle and picking it up thought subconsciously that the patty on it was 100 chicken is it actually no it is chicken and water and other stuff but what we are actually supposed to infer from that language is that the company who makes this sandwich purchases 100 chicken whatever that is and mixes it with the rest of the ingredients to made something which is mostly chicken in legal land that is all that can be inferred from the statement it 's not exactly deceptive but it 's definitely not the clearest terminology that could be employed and it definitely implies something that simply made with chicken does not imply   i agree with you that the package almost always has all the information i would reasonably want on it though and in many cases it is obvious that same sandwich lists all of the ingredients of the patty on the back so the information is right there if you want to go to the small text

i 'm staring at this chart and asking myself how long a period is enough to have an average i 'd be happy with regardless of the direction the market goes   3 years 4 years clearly a lump sum investment risks a 2000 buy at 1500 not good honestly i love the question and find it interesting but there 's likely no exact answer just some back and forth analysis you 're investing about $ 40k yr anyway i 'd suggest a 4 year timeframe is a good time to invest the new money as well other folk want to offer opinions edit with the op 's additional info he expects these bonuses to continue my updated advice is to dca quarterly if going into assets with a transaction fee or monthly if into a no fee fund over just a one year period

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

genuine nearly passive income can be had from some kinds of investing index funds are an example of a mostly self managing investment of course investment involves some risk the income is essentially paying you for taking that risk and returns are reasonable but proportional to the risk ie not spectacular unless the risk is high if someone is claiming they can get you better than market rate of return look carefully at what they are getting out of it and what the risks are fees subtract directly from your gains and if they claim there is no additional risk they need to prove that you are giving someone your money be very sure you are going to get it back if it is n't self evident where the income comes from it 's probably a scam if someone is using the term auto pilot it is almost certainly a scam if they are talking about website advertising and the like it is far from autopilot if you want to make any amount of money though you may make money for them

first off great job on your finances so far you are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future   also it is a great question    first i agree with @littleadv take advantage of your employer match do not drop your 401(k contributions below that also good job on putting your contributions into the roth account second i would ask are you out of debt   if not put all your extra income towards paying off debt and then you can work your plan third time to do some math   what will your business look like   how much capital would you need to get started   are there things you can do now on a part time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business come up with a figure find some mutual funds that have a low beta and back out how much money you need to save per month so you have around that total   then you have a figure e.g. assume you need $ 20,000 and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years   then you would need to save about $ to be ready to go in 10 years or $ to go in about 5 years   it 's a time value of money calculation the house is really a long way off but you could do the same kind of calculation   i feel that you think your income and possibly locale will change dramatically over the next few years   it might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business and designate one half for the house

as someone in the very same position as you here is what i suggest have $ 1,000 for each possible large expense you currently have for example house car pregnant wife etc as someone who only has a car living at home still i only have $ 1,000 in my emergency fund the absolute rest of my money goes to paying off the loans as soon as possible i mean ever single dollar there is no point for investing unless you have a really good return on investment i am not too sure how common returns of 6.8 are but that seems above average if in fact you 're just stashing it in a bank account at ~1 you 're doing it wrong   getting out of debt is not only just about the financial benefits but the emotional benefits too it feels really nice to not owe anybody anything   good luck man     p.s. try using a tracker like to show how much you 're losing a day by remaining in debt this will better help you understand if your investments are making you money or losing your money

you are very correct rebalancing is basically selling off winners to buy losers of course the thinking is that selling a winner that has already increased 100 on the basis that it has doubled so it is likely to go down in the near future however just look at apple as an example if you bought apple in june 2009 for $ 20 adjusted price and sold it as part of rebalancing when it rose to $ 40 adjusted price in september 2010 you would have missed out on it reaching over $ 95 2 years later similarly you look to rebalance by buying assets which have been say dropped by 50 on the basis that it has dropped so much that it should start increasing in the near future but many times the price can fall even further a better method would be to sell your winners when they stop being winners i.e. their uptrend ends and replace them with assets that are just starting their winning ways i.e. their downtrend has ended and are now starting to uptrend this can be achieved by looking at price action and referring to the definitions of an uptrend and a downtrend definition of an uptrend higher highs and higher lows definition of a downtrend lower lows and lower highs

you did n't have a situation of excess contribution if you have proof that someone in fidelity actually told you what you said you might try to recover some of your losses through a lawsuit however their first and main defense would be that they 're not in the business of providing tax advice and it is your problem that you asked random person a tax question and then acted on an incorrect answer by the way that only goes to say that anything you might read here you should as well take with a grain of salt the only one who can give you a tax advice is a licensed tax professional i explained it in details in my blog post but in short it is either an ea enrolled agent with the irs credentials or a cpa certified public accountant or attorney licensed in your state back to your question excess contribution to a ira is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed for traditional ira in 2012 the limit was $ 5000 you contributed $ 4000 this means that you were not in excess there 's nothing they can correct the 1099-r you got seems to be correct and in order what you did have was a case of non deductible contribution non deductible contribution to your ira should have been reported to the irs on form 8606 non deductible contribution creates basis in your ira withdrawals from your ira are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate it is also calculated using form 8606 so in short you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring non deductible ira and creating $ 4000 basis and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the $ 4000 you withdrew is non taxable if your total ira in all accounts was that $ 4000 then nothing would be taxable talk to a tax adviser you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately if possible and then do some math on your 2013 return if 60 days have n't passed you might want to consider depositing the $ 4000 in a roth ira and perform what is called conversion

why do savings accounts for businesses offer less yield than bank accounts for individuals   the money held in savings account on a collective average substantial amount stays with the bank the bank is better able to predict and thus invest this money in individual savings account in market to make more money money held in business accounts are unpredictable and can get withdrawn the bank is thus not able to predict the behaviour and hence not able to invest this better to get good returns hence the interest offered is low most banks have special products for businesses that would give better return but come with some kind of lock in or minimum balances

you say it 's expensive   i 'm going to interpret this as the monthly payments are too high basically you need to get your old loan paid off presumably by selling the car you have now   this is the tough part   if you sold the car now how much would you get for it   you can use blue book to figure out what the car is roughly worth   that 's not a guarantee that it will actually sell for that much   look in your local to see what similar cars are selling for   keep in mind that you will usually get less for your old car if you trade it in versus sell it yourself now if you owe more than your car is worth you 're in a really tight spot   if you do n't get enough money when you sell it you are still stuck with the remainder of the loan   in that case it is usually best to just stick with the car you have and be more cautious about payments and loan length the next time you finance a car penalties   most car loans do n't have any kind of early repayment penalty   however you should check your loan paperwork just to make sure

very important returning again to the example of the farmer efficient liquid markets that fairly reflect the price of a given asset allow that farmer to run his business as cost effectively as he can that in theory lowers the price of his goods for the consumer if he was n't able to efficiently hedge he would have to charge a premium to reflect the price risk he takes on between planting and harvesting his corn   being pedantic here but single stock futures markets are extremely quiet if you were the owner of a company and you traded options on your company stock a hilariously common form of insider trading yes that would be illegal and the sec would certainly come after you

first i do n't claim to have all the answers but can appreciate the dialogue and question you 're posing   as you stated you love the overall advertising experience and i 'm assuming sales generation from those experiences since that is how you 'll generate revenue   integrated marketing to me has always seemed like an especially narrow subject matter i do n't mean that it is simply or easy by any means but rather you become a story teller in the advertising world and your story is to impact your target audience in a particular way i 'll use myself as an example i am a former college athlete and currently work in sales marketing supply chain i watch a lot of sports with my two sons and saw the recent gatorade ad about in order to win you have to lose that ad has stuck in my head because i know that commitment from to school to work it 's a brilliant concept that has me hooked to me that is what is all about a concept that was tailored to tell a story of success through failure and having athletes that repeat that story a truly hand crafted product that now has me opt for a gatorade when leaving the gym    when i consider marketing as a whole i do n't think of these types of tailored situations but rather the whole puzzle marketing and its counterpart analytics create a solid shape for a business to thrive your personal sales lines and how your sales people are performing are a part of your marketing potential customer service to build relations and increase your net promoter scores technical applications to develop products that are in line with customer demand and in turn the supply chain foresight to deliver on said products all of it is marketing    hope this helps

i know this is n't a direct answer to your question about unloading a used i 've always donated it to charity and written off the price it got at auction on my taxes but i think the following might be useful to anyone facing a big repair bill you know your car 's condition if in doubt pay your mechanic to evaluate it as if he was considering buying it for his daughter if you were shopping for a used car and you found one exactly like yours in exactly the same condition treated exactly as well as you treat yours and with all the records to prove that but with the repairs already done how much would you be willing to pay for it if that number is more than the repair cost repairing is a good deal   if it 's less than the repair cost is it enough less to justify the hassle of car shopping if so unload it and use the repair money to buy something better if it 's in the middle flip a coin or pick whichever makes you feel better

i 'm expanding on what had added to his answer the assumption of same tax bracket in retirement is convenient but simplistic if you are in for instance the second lowest bracket now and happen to remain in the second lowest bracket for retirement then roth and traditional account options may seem equal and your math backs that up on the surface but that 's making an implicit assumption that tax rates will be constant yet tax brackets and rates can change and they do the proof i.e. your 15 bracket could become say the 17 bracket or perhaps the 13 bracket all the while you might remain in the second lowest bracket so given the potential for fluctuating tax rates it 's easy to see that there can be a case where a traditional tax deferred account can yield more after tax income than a roth post tax account even if you remain in the same bracket when your tax bracket 's tax rate declines so do n't just consider what bracket you expect to be in consider also whether you expect tax rates to go up down or remain the same for twenty something young folk retirement is a long way away ~40 years and i think in that time frame it is far more likely that the tax brackets wo n't have the same underlying tax rates that they have now of course we ca n't know for sure which direction tax rates will head in but an educated guess can help is your government deep in debt or flush with extra cash on the other hand if you do n't feel comfortable making predictions much better than simply assuming brackets and rates will stay the same as now so it does n't matter is to instead hedge your bets save some of your retirement money in a roth style account and some in a traditional pre tax account consider it tax diversification see also my answer at this older but related question

of course you do n't have to pay them you just might not like the result as a matter of law given that i am not a lawyer i am not aware of any requirement for a company to pay employees business related expenses an example might be having a cell phone and according to this article companies are n't required to pay for you to have a cell phone even if they require you have one and use it as part of your employment the primary areas where law does exist relates to company uniforms with a logo in a very limited number of us states and necessary personal safety equipment in california and maybe only few other states all other tool requirements for a job are not prohibited by law so long as they are not illegally discriminatory such as requiring people of a certain race or sex to buy something but no one else etc so a company can require all sorts of things from having an internet connection to cell phone to laptop to specialty tools and equipment of all sorts and they are even allowed to deduct the cost of some things from your pay just so long as you still get paid minimum wage after the deductions with all that said the company 's previous payments of fees and willingness to pay a monthly internet fee does not them to pay other fees too such as moving installation etc they may even decide to no longer provide internet service at their expense and just require you to provide it as a condition of employment you can insist on it with your employer and if you do n't have an employment contract that forbids it they can fire you or possibly even deduct it from your pay anyway and this reason might not be one that allows you to collect unemployment insurance benefits but you 'd need to check with an expert on that you can refuse to pay at&t directly and they can cancel the internet service and your employer can then do the same as in the previous condition or you can choose to pay it or ask your employer to split the cost over a few checks if it is rather high and that 's about it like the cost of anything else you have to pay   from your own food to your computer clothes etc it 's best to just consider it your own cost of doing business and decide if it 's still in your interest to keep working there and for something to consider in future pay negotiations you may also qualify for an itemized employee business expense deduction from the irs but you 'll need to read the requirements carefully and get keep a receipt for such expenses

i think   the cleanest way to do this is to rent the house from your father for 2 years possibly adding an option to buy at a set price to the lease agreement   that takes care of any gift issues and avoids complications like you living in a house that you could n't afford to own otherwise   if when you are able to afford a mortgage get a mortgage on the house and buy it from your father    will a bank be willing to take out a mortgage on a house that i technically own for the full amount i would not take out a mortgage for anything more than 80 of the house 's market value   anything more than that and you need to pay mortgage insurance which will increase your monthly payment for no benefit to you    my biggest concern is that you wo n't be able to afford an 80 mortgage after 2 years   if your father really wants to keep the house in the family then he should either keep the house and rent it to you or give you the down payment as a gift keeping under the maximum gift to avoid taxes if neither you or your father can not afford the house you may have no choice but to sell it   i would not advise you make a bad financial decision purely for sentimental reasons

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

the advantage of interest only mortgages is that they can increase your cashflow as you are only paying the interest and not any part of the principle we have most of our investment loans on interest only for 10 years when we got the loans about 6 to 7 years ago our lvr was only 60 and the property prices have increased by about 40 in that time we also place our excess cashflow into offset accounts linked to the investment loans so there is extra cash available in case things go bad the disadvantage of interest only mortgages is that you are not paying off any principal for the length of the interest only period if you are over extended this could cause problems as you need to rely totally on the price of the property going up for your equity to increase as you are currently paying mortgage insurance leads me to believe your lvr is above 80 so you would not have much equity available in your home with an interest only loan this could pose you some problems you should never try to over extend yourself the slightest thing that goes wrong could get you into financial troubles always try to have some buffer to help you stay on your feet if circumstances do change for the worst
# 521233
the short answer is that banking is complicated but the bank really does n't need your money because it can get it from the fed almost free it can only use 90 of the money you give the bank it can only make money on that 90 from very low risk and thus low return investments and as it has to show a profit to its shareholders it will take whatever cut it needs to off the top of the returns all of these things combine to make savings account interest roughly .05 in the us right now the longer answer all fdic insured banks which the us requires all depositor banks to be are subject to regulation by the federal reserve the very first rule that all banks must comply with is that depositor money can not be invested in things the fed terms risky this limits banks from investing your money in things that have high returns like stocks commodities and hedges because along with the high possible returns come high risk banks typically can only invest your savings in t debt and in certain fed approved aaa bonds which have very low risk and so very little return the investment of bank assets into risky market funds was a major contributor to the financial crisis with the repeal of the glass steagall act banks had been allowed to integrate their fdic insured depositor business with their investment banking business not fdic insured while still not allowed to bet on risky investments with deposits banks were using their own money retained profits corporate equity bond money to bet heavily in the markets and were investing depositor funds in faulty aaa rated investment objects like cdos when the housing market crashed banks had to pull out of the investment market and cash in hedges like credit default swaps to cover the depositor losses which sent a wave through the rest of the market banks really ca n't even loan your money out to people who walk in like you 'd think they would and which they traditionally used to do that 's how the savings and loan crisis happened when speculators took out huge loans to invest lost the cash declared bankruptcy and left the s&ls and ultimately the fdic on the hook for depositors money   so the upshot of all this is that the bank simply wo n't give you more on your money than it is allowed to make on it   in addition there are several tools that the fed has to regulate economic activity and three big ones play a part first is the federal funds rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges on loans made to other banks which is a primary source of day to day liquidity for these banks money paid as interest to the fed is effectively removed from the economy and is a way to reduce the money supply right now the ffr is .25 that 's one quarter of one percent which is effectively zero borrow a billion dollars $ from the fed for one month and you 'll pay them a $ banks lend to other banks at a rate based on the ffr called the interbank rate usually adding some fraction of a percent so the lending bank makes money on the loan this means that the banks can get money from the fed and from other banks very cheaply which means they do n't have to offer high interest rates on savings to entice individual depositors to save their money with the bank second is quantitative easing which just means the fed buys government bonds and pays for them with new money this happens all the time remember those interest charges on bank loans to keep the money supply stable the fed must buy t debt at least in the amount of the interest being charged otherwise the money leaves the economy and is not available to circulate the fed usually buys a little more than it collects in order to gradually increase the money supply which allows the economy to grow while controlling inflation having too much money and so making money worth less than what it can buy   what 's new is that the fed is increasing the money supply by a very large amount by buying bonds far in excess of the low rates it 's charging and at fixed prices determined by the yield the fed wants to induce in the markets in the first place with the fed buying so many there are fewer for institutions and other investors to buy this increases the demand driving down yields as investors besides the fed are willing to pay a similar price and remember that t debt is one of the main things banks are allowed to invest your deposits in inflation is n't a concern right now despite the large amount of new money being injected because the current economy is so lackluster right now that the new cash is just being sat upon by corporations and being used by consumers to pay down debt instead of what the fed and government want us to do hire update equipment buy houses and american cars etc in addition the spot market price for a t bond or any investment security is generally what the last guy paid by buying treasury debt gradually at a fixed price the fed can smooth out in the spot price that speculators may try to induce by making low buy offers on t debt to increase yields lastly the fed can tell banks that they must keep a certain amount of their deposits in reserve basically by keeping them in a combination of cash in the vault and in accounts with the fed itself this has a dual purpose higher reserve rates allow a bank to weather a run more people than usual wanting their money and thus reduces risk of failure an increased reserves amount also reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy because obviously if the banks have to keep a percentage of assets in cash they ca n't invest that cash banks are currently required to keep 10 of deposited assets the sum of all checking and savings accounts but not cds in cash this compounds the other problems with banks investing not only are they not getting a great return on your savings they can only use 90 of your savings to get it

one alternative strategy you may want to consider is writing covered calls on the stock you have just sitting there   this will allow you to earn a return the premium from the calls without necessarily having to give up your holding as a brief overview options are derivatives that give the holder the right or option to buy or sell shares at a specified price   holders of call options with a strike $ x on a particular security have the right to purchase that security at the strike price $ x.   conversely holders of put options with a strike price of $ x have the right to sell that security at the strike price $ x.   always on the other side of a call or put option is a person that has sold the option which is called writing the option   if this person writes a call option then he will be obligated to sell a certain amount of stock 100 shares per contract at the strike price if that option is exercised   a writer of a put option will be obligated to by 100 shares per contract at the strike price if that option is exercised covered calls involve writing call contracts on stock that you own   for example say you own 100 shares of aapl and that aapl is currently trading for $ 330   you decide to write a jan 21 2012 call on these shares at a strike price of $ 340 earning you a premium of say $ 300 two things can now happen if the price of aapl is not at least $ 340 on january 21 then the options are out of the money and will expire unexercised why exercise an option to buy at $ 340 when you can buy at the currently cheaper market price   you keep your aapl stock plus the $ 300 premium you earn   if however the price of aapl is greater than $ 340 the option will be exercised and you will now be required to sell the shares you own at $ 340   you will earn a return of $ 10/share $ plus the $ 300 premium from the call option   you still make out in the end but have unfortunately incurred an opportunity cost as had you not written the call option you would have been able to sell at the market price which is higher than the $ 340 strike price covered calls are considered relatively safe and conservative however the strategy is most effective for stocks that are expected to stay within a relatively narrow price range for the duration of the contract   they do provide one option of earning additional money on stocks you are currently holding albeit at the risk of giving up some returns if the stock price rises above the strike price

yes it is possible as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 50 that is if the price reached $ 15.00 so you would type in 15.00 in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order these conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them

you 're spot on for whole foods this is a great step for them and for amazon i 've spoken with coworkers across my company that have been severely disappointed in the past with the amazon grocery development i see this as a easy way for amazon to enter brick and mortar compete in a more tangible way with other grocery chains and still be amazon    ultimately whole foods amazon does not mean better prices from farm marketers grain pork corn beef salt prices are going to if anything lower for farmers for larger profits as the marketers have not changed monsanto are still big players that are all in talks with to make this merger sustainable for amazon and whole foods that supply chain remains until amazon moves into a rather deeper market

the company says it 's out of their control it is n't all they have to do is to instruct hsbc to send a certain amount of gbp and then hsbc must send gbp   obviously the bank does n't like that because they make money through the conversion that 's not your problem when told to send gbp they must send gbp   depending on what your relationship with that company is you lost money because they did n't send the gbp at the very least they sent you four percent less in euros than they should have sent you so send them a bill for the difference it 's unfortunate that your bank charged for the conversion euro to gbp but fact is that less than the agreed amount arrived at your bank and that 's the responsibility of the sender

these agencies consolidate your debt and make it an easy monthly instalment for you they also try to negotiate with credit cards they do so for a fee other option is to not pay the debt during this time expect credit cards to keep sending you bills and reminders and ways to contact you once it is not paid for a significant amount of time 18 months the lender will sell your debt to a collection agency you will start getting bills from collection agencies collection agencies can settle for up to 40 of the actual debt so if you had 5 credit cards you would have 5 different collection agencies trying to get in touch with you you can call them and tell them that you can not pay the full amount they will offer you settlements which you can accept or decline the longer the unpaid debt the more the discount they will offer one very important thing to remember is that the unpaid amount will be sent to you on a form this means you have to recognize this as income it is applicable to the year when the debt is settled in a nut shell you owe 120,000 you do n't pay credit cards keeps calling you you do n't pay after 12 18 months they your debt to collection agencies collection agencies will try to get in touch with you send you lawsuit letters you call and settle for say 50,000 you pay off 50,000 in 2016 your debt is settled but wait you will get forms from different agencies totaling 70,000 unpaid debt you will have to declare that as income and you will owe tax on that assuming say 30 tax you will have to pay up as tax to irs assuming no other income for simplicity so what you did was pay up 50 + 21 = and settled the debt of 120,000 your credit score will be much better than if you never paid at all

at the current rates stated in the question i would push additional funds towards your stafford loans as their higher interest rates will incur interest charges almost 3 times faster than your private loans with my loans i have not seen much information regarding private loans jumping the interest rate close to the 6.8 any time in the coming years if others have insight to this i look forward to the comments   due to the private loans being variable there is an element of risk to their rates increasing another way to look at it may be to prorate your amount of extra payments according to their interest rate   $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your stafford loans $ 1,000 x + = $ toward your private loans

the goal of the kelly criterion strategy is to find a balance between preservation of starting capital and returns one of extreme you could bet the entirety of your account on one trade which would maximize your returns if you win but leave you unable to further invest if you lose on the other extreme you could bet the smallest amount of capital possible over the course of several trades to increase the probability that you 'll even out to 70 accuracy over time but this method would be extremely slow   so for your case investing 40 each time is one way to find an optimal balance between these two extremes use this as a rule of thumb though because your own situation and investing goals may differ from the goal of   optimal growth

first of all look for a savings account with a decent interest rate online banks are good at offering those and you can transfer your money back and forth from the checking account with a couple of business days delay ing direct offers 1.1 apy right now lame but much better than nearly nothing if you 'd like a little nicer rate of return you should also consider putting some of the money the part you need least in a short- or intermediate term bond etf or mutual fund you can sell them quite readily they pay more interest than a savings account and because of the shorter maturities involved the interest rate risk is limited that 's the one that makes your bonds less valuable now because the rates went up after you bought them i have some nyse that 's yielding 3.8 or so

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

there are certain standards that modern checks need to meet these are n't required by law but banks today generally insist on them if you are able to meet these standards and print your own checks at home you are allowed to do so one way this is commonly done is with purchased check and check printing software office supply stores sell check that fit into standard computer printers this check paper includes the necessary security features of checks and using the check printing software you can print your personal information including your name address your bank 's name and address and your account numbers the account numbers on the bottom of the checks are called the micr code which stands for magnetic ink character recognition normally these numbers were printed with special magnetic ink which was used in automated check reading machines checks that you purchase from your bank still use magnetic ink however modern check readers are optical and do n't require magnetic ink so you should be able to print checks with your printer using standard ink toner and not have a problem without purpose specific check printing software you could still buy blank check paper from the store and with a little trial and error you could print using excel   the biggest challenge with doing this would be printing the micr code you would probably need to install an micr font on your computer and play around with the size and location until you get it where you want it   doing a little googling i see that there are some check printing excel templates out there but i have n't tried any of these and it is unclear to me whether they actually print the micr or whether they assume that you have blank checks with the micr account number and check numbers already printed without purchasing blank check paper you wo n't have any of the security features such as protection anti background etc   as you mentioned if you are depositing checks via mobile phone app as some banks now allow none of these security features are doing any good   the problem however is that you are not writing checks for yourself you are writing checks to other people and you have no way of knowing whether or not their banks are going to give them trouble with your checks   there is enough check fraud out there that lots of bank tellers are very cautious   i recommend sticking with check paper that has the security features because if nothing else it will make your check look more like a real check

because i feel the answers given do not represent the answer you are expecting i 'd like to re but include more information when you own stock in a company you own some of that company when that company makes profit you usually receive a dividend of those profits if you owned 1 of the company stock you should recieve 1 of the profits if your company is doing well someone might ask to buy your stock the price of that stock is supposed to be worth a value representative of the expected yield or how much of a dividend you 'd be getting   the worth of that is what you 're betting on when you buy the stock if you buy $ 100 worth of coca cola stock and they paid $ 10 as dividend you 'd be pretty happy with a 10 growth in your wealth especially if the banks are only playing 3 so maybe some other guy sees your 10 increase and thinks heck 10 is better than 3 if i buy your stocks even as much as 6 more than they are worth $ 106 i 'm still going to be better off by that extra 1 than i would be if i left it in the bank so he offers you $ 106 and you think awesome i can sell my $ 100 of cola shares now make a $ 6 profit and buy $ 100 worth of some other share i think will pay a good dividend then cola their profits and they only made 2 profit that guy that bought your shares for $ 106 only got a dividend of $ 2 since their worth is still $ 100 and effectively he lost $ 4 as a result he bet on a better than 10 profit and lost out when it did n't hit that now imho while the stock market was supposed to be about buying shares and getting dividends people brokers discovered that you could make far more money buying and selling shares for perceived value rather than waiting for dividends to show actual value especially if you were not the one doing the buying and selling and risk but instead making a 0.4 cut off the difference between each purchase broker fees so tl;dr   many people have lost money in the market to those who made money from them but only the traders and gamblers

i think people are conflating two sets of terms unsecured secured and good bad are not synonyms debt may be secured or unsecured if i take a loan against a car or house it is typically secured so the object is collateral against the loan bad debt in financial terms is a loan that is not expected to be recovered a bank might write off a loan or a portion of a loan as bad debt if the borrower goes bankrupt or into administration for example both secured and unsecured loans may be considered bad debt i think the context in which the question is being asked is how to distinguish between sensible and borrowing an extreme example of borrowing would be to buy a pc on a store card pcs devalue very quickly and a store card may charge 30 apr so paying the minimum off each month would mean paying   more than twice the sticker price for a product that is now worth less than half the original borrowed amount on the other hand a 3 mortgage when borrowing less than 60 of the value of a property is a good bet from a lender 's perspective and would be a good debt to have not as good as no debt but better a high apr one

a long put you have a small initial cost the option premium but profit as the stock goes down you have no additional risk if the shock rises even a lot short a stock you gain if the stock drops but have unlimited risk if it rises the call mitigates this by capping that rising stock risk the profit loss graph looks similar to the long put when you hold both the short position and the long call   you might consider producing a graph or spreadsheet to compare positions you can easily sketch put call long stock short stock and study how combinations of positions can synthetically look like other positions often when a stock has no shares to short the synthetic short can help you put your stock position in place

quantitative easing explained the short of it is that you 're right the fed or another country 's central bank is basically creating a large amount of new money which it then injects into the economy by buying government and institutional debt this is in fact one of the main jobs of the central bank for a currency to manage the money supply which in most fiat systems involves slowly increasing the amount of money to keep the economy growing if there is n't enough money moving around in the economy it 's reflected in a slowdown in gdp growth while controlling inflation the devaluation of a unit of currency with respect to most or all things that unit will buy including other currencies inflation 's primary cause is defined quite simply as too many dollars chasing too few goods when demand is low for cash because you have a lot of it while demand for goods is high the suppliers of those goods will increase their price for the goods because people are willing to pay that higher price and will also produce more with quantitative easing the central bank is increasing the money supply by several percentage points of gdp much higher than is normally needed this normally would cause the two things you mentioned inflation inflation 's primary cause is too many dollars chasing too few goods when money is easy to get and various types of goods and services are not people bid up the price on these things to get them this usually happens when sellers see high demand for a product and increase the price to take advantage and to prevent a shortage this often happens across the board in a situation like this but there are certain key drivers that can cause other prices to increase things like the price of oil which affects transportation costs and thus the price to have anything shipped anywhere whether it be the raw materials you need or the finished product you 're selling with the injection of so much money into the economy rampant inflation would normally be the result however there are other variables at play in this particular situation chief among them is that no matter how much cash is in the economy most of it is being sat on in the form of cash or other safe havens like durable commodities gold and t debt so most of the money the fed is injecting into the economy is not chasing goods it 's repaying debt savings and generally being hoarded by consumers and institutions as a hedge against the poor economy in addition despite how many dollars are in the economy right now those dollars are in high demand all around the world to buy treasury debt one of the biggest safe havens in the global market right now so much so that buying t debt is considered saving this is why the yields on treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows it 's bad everywhere and u.s. government debt is one of the surest things in the world market especially now that euro bonds have become suspect currency devaluation this is basically specialized inflation when there are more dollars in the market than people want to have in order to use to buy our goods and services demand for our currency the medium of trade for our goods and services drops and it takes fewer euros yen or yuan to buy a dollar this can happen even if demand for our dollars inside our own borders is high and is generally a function of our trade situation if we 're buying more from other countries than they are from us then our dollars are flooding the currency exchange markets and thus become cheaper because they 're easy to get again there are other variables at play here that keep our currency strong first off again it 's bad everywhere nobody 's buying anything from anyone relatively speaking and so the relative trade deficits are n't moving much in addition devaluation without inflation is self if currency devalues but inflation is low the cheaper currency makes the things that currency can buy cheaper which encourages people to buy them at the same time the more expensive foreign currency increases the cost in dollars of foreign made goods all of this can be beneficial from a money policy standpoint devaluation makes american goods cheaper to americans and to foreign consumers alike than foreign goods and so a policy that puts downward pressure on the dollar but does n't make inflation a risk can help american manufacturing and other producer businesses china knows this just as well as we do and for decades has been artificially fixing the exchange rate of the b yuan lower than its true value against the dollar meaning that no matter how cheap american goods get on the world market chinese goods are still cheaper because by definition the yuan has greater purchasing power for the same cost in dollars in addition dollars are n't only used to buy american made goods and services the u.s. has positioned its currency over the years to be an international medium of trade for several key commodities like oil and the primary currency for global lenders like the imf and the world bank that means that dollars become necessary to buy these things and are received from and must be repaid to these institutions and thus the dollar has a built in demand pretty much regardless of our trade deficits   on top of all that a lot of countries base their own currencies on our dollar by basically buying dollars using other valuable media like gold or oil and then holding that cash in their own central banks as the store of value backing their own paper money this is called a dollar board their money becomes worth a particular fraction of a dollar by definition and that relationship is very precisely with 10 billion dollars in the vault and 20 billion issued from 's central bank a is worth $ .50 print an additional 20 billion and the value of one decreases to $ .25 buy an additional 10 billion dollars and the 's value increases again to $ .50 quite a few countries do this mostly in south america again creating a built in demand for u.s. dollars and also tying the u.s. dollar to the value of the exports of that country if 's goods become highly demanded by europe and its currency increases relative to the dollar then the u.s. dollar gets a boost because by definition it is worth an exact fixed number of and also because a country with a dollar board typically has no problem accepting dollars as payment and then printing to maintain the exchange rate

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of x. as time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items length of credit outweigh your negative items but there are no big increases or decrease in your score then you make a one time change to how you use credit if this is a event that helps your score there will be a increase in your score if it is bad thing your score will drop but if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely overtime the impact will lessen and the score will return your your normal range spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money

i think that author does a disservice by writing such seemingly sensible articles without actually knowing how things work if i did nâ€™t know better i would think this guy was teaching me something it â€™s a shame he did not do research before he started writing   let â€™s say you buy a classic car you take super good care of it all original mint condition you paid cash for it out of your savings this is a balance sheet transaction that has nothing to do with income you traded your cash asset for a classic car asset   now let â€™s say this car is so rare and you keep it in such good condition that it gains value every year maybe it was worth $ 15k when you bought it but this year it â€™s already worth $ 17k great job on making a great purchase but is that $ 2k gain counted as income to you no it is not the value of that asset on your balance sheet went up but you did not make anything off of that increase in value because you have not sold it   if you had to pay taxes on the increase in value every year those taxes would essentially force you to sell that car to pay the taxes just because you took care of it additionally in the long term no one would want to own anything so this would destroy the value of everyone â€™s stuff but i digress   in this example amazon stock is the car the author is seeing the increase in stock value adding to the balance sheets of the investors who bought the stock and confusing that with income   back to our example let â€™s say your car increased in value $ 2k a year for two years and you decide to sell it for $ 19k now we are about to realize some income since you bought it for $ 15k and sold for $ 19k you earned an income of the difference or $ 4k    your income was nâ€™t $ 19k because you originally put $ 15k in cash into the car that cash was already saved from income you made in the past and it is not counted again as income in this sale   because you did not work for this new car sale income but it was derived from asset growth the income is called capital gains you invested your capital $ 15k into the asset car and that asset appreciated when you sold it you received capital money back in exchange for that asset the capital you received is more than what you invested which is to say you gained $ 4k of capital by investing in and then selling your   asset car   because you held the car for two years you qualify for lower long term capital gains tax rate on that $ 4k had you sold it after year 1 you paid your regular normal income tax rate on those capital gains either way you owe the tax when you sell the asset not when it appreciates   i â€™m sure you realize this already but if we change the car to amazon stock in my story this is exactly how it works with investors   the author gets several things wrong    1 amazon profits are not passed through to shareholders for income tax purposes if amazon paid dividends those dividends would be taxed at payout at the long term capital gains rate and they would be paid out of cash amazon has left after it already paid corporate taxes on profits    amazon has decided they can add more value to investors by using cash to grow instead of paying dividends when the investors sell the stock they will owe capital gains on the growth of that stock if amazon is correct that using cash to grow then investors will effectively pay more when they sell the stock than they would pay today if dividends were paid   2 asset appreciation is not income those investors will realize the income when they sell the stock and they will pay the tax then    3 he is missing the point entirely on why amazon runs a low profit or how business strategy translates into financials low prices are not a function of low profitability low profitability could be an adverse result of low pricing but being low profit in order to be low price is a ridiculous and failing strategy amazon â€™s low pricing is a function of their unparalleled buying power unparalleled consumer and product data amazing logistics prowess clever loyalty programs like amazon prime and many other brilliant things they â€™ve done their low profitability is a function of their investment in things like amazon fresh amazon alexa drone delivery automated convenience stores building out cloud computing infrastructure and many other r&amp;d projects $ 4 billion in original content spending for amazon prime video and all kinds of expenditures years ahead of when they become profitable by the time consumers want it amazon already built it three years ago this is the power of amazon sometimes multi billion dollar experiments fail and all that money was for nothing sometimes they lose money for a few years and then become the infrastructure that runs a third of the internet amazon does not let fear of failure stop them they invest in growth with their cash this is how bezos thinks how do we build the future not how can i avoid tax     i do need to make a disclaimer here there could be special tax treatment of classic cars that makes my example not work also classic cars may not appreciate in value i do nâ€™t know anything about classic cars i just picked a politically neutral thing to put in my story and made some assumptions to illustrate how capital gains work my story is definitely how stocks work and probably cars but i just want to point out that i do nâ€™t know shit about car collecting

the name of this type of investment is capital guaranteed investment and yes they do exist some financial institutions do offer them from time to time and they can be better than putting money in the bank unlike what someone else said your money is not is not locked for the five years you can take out your investment at any time but if you do take your money out before the term 5 years in your mother 's case the capital is void so you would only withdrawal your money if the investment is currently in because if it is at a loss when you go to withdrawal you get hit with the loss in many cases you will get a third party usually a large bank being guarantor for the capital guarantee and they in turn get paid for this obligation

i think that the general public is conditioned to think more in terms of points rather than percentages so that 200 points is easier to fathom than the equivalent percent we all translate internally what this means of course it is less precise but it also makes for good copy in the publishing industry market down 1000 points

a company typically goes public in order to bring in additional capital in an ipo the company through its officials will typically do so by issuing additional shares and offering to sell those to investors if they did not do that then there would be no net capital gain for the company if person a sells share in company c to person b then company c does not benefit directly from the exchange by issuing and selling additional shares the total value of all stock in the company can increase being publicly traded also greatly increases the confidence in the valuation of the company as a consequence of the perfect market theory there is nothing in this that says that initial investors cofounders employees etc need to sell their shares in the process they might choose to do so or they might not or they might be prevented from doing so by terms of any agreements that they have signed or by insider trading laws compare what happens to internal stock when a company goes public depending on specifics it might be reasonable for the company to perform a share split prior to the initial public offering that however does n't affect the total value of the shares only the price per share

down payment emphatically avoid pmi if at all possible it 's pouring money down the drain do 20 down if you can or pay off enough to bring you above 20 and ask for pmi to be removed as soon as you can beyond that it 's a matter of how much risk you want to accept and how long you 'll own the place and you 'll have to run the numbers for the various alternatives allowing for uncertainty in your investments to guide your decision do not assume you will be able to make a profit when you sell the house that 's the mistake which left many people under water and/or foreclosed on do not assume that you will be able to sell it quickly it can take a year of more do not assume immediate or 100 occupancy it you rent it out see many other answers here for more realistic numbers and remember that running a rental is a business and has ongoing costs and hassles you can contract those out but then you lose a good percentage of the rent income double mortgage is another great way to dig yourself into a financial hole it can be a bigger cost than the pmi it tries to dodge and is definitely a bigger risk do n't

you can do this through a journal entry in quickbooks   it can all be entered as one entry there 's no need to do separate ones for each bill the journal entry should debit accounts payable and credit your equity account   in the line for accounts payable make sure to choose your name in the name column   this in effect enters a credit to your account which will offset the bills that were shown there previously the last step is to apply those credits to the bills   even though they offset each other your name would still show up in any reports and in the pay bills window   to do this open the pay bills window and select one of the bills owed to you   there should be an option to choose apply credits or something similar depends on which version of quickbooks you are running   choose that option and apply credits in the amount of the bill so that it zeroes out   do the same for all of the other bills   once they are all checked off click the button to pay bills   this wo n't actually pay anything but will instead just apply the credits to the bills as indicated

i agree with what you 're saying that people are n't completely rational   but to build an entire system on their irrationality is ludicrous at some point they figure it out   this is exactly how things change and change dramatically     gt they are far too worried about the day in day out running of their business to spend their time day dreaming of how to hide away all of their money once they become rich   yeah but if they do n't think they 're going to get rich they 'll simply stop minding the day to day   i would and if they figure out that they 're going to be to be sacrificed at the of wealth redistribution they 're going to stop     already people are to the fact that college educations do not bring them prosperity

my answer is microsoft excel   google vba for dummies seriously and find out if your brokerage offers an api   with a brief understanding of coding you can get a spreadsheet that is live connected to your brokers data stream   say you have a spreadsheet with the 1990 value of each in the first two columns cells a1 and   maybe this formula could be the third column it 'll tell you how much to buy or sell to rebalance them    then to the rebalance set both a2 and b2 to = and drag the formula through row 25 one row for each year   it 'll probably be a little more work than that but you get the idea

just like many other industries entertainment is becoming a commodity of convenience which means that it also is getting far less profit margin it wo n't die but the money that keeps the big named companies in the black is slowly out they are going to fight this tooth and nail just as past companies in other industries that have paved the same path have tried any sense of success on their part only makes their fall much harder down the road we are moving into a world where entertainment is more plentiful and cheap but the cost will be that we see fewer big budget offerings

tl;dr   prosecutors probably thing they ca n't meet the reasonable doubt standard and the deck is heavily stacked against lawsuits   the whole running the company into the ground part is legal   it 's stupid but no different than any bad boss that pits employees against each other   just on a much scale   the real estate thing is extremely shady   however when you 're the boss of a company it 's not considered theft to do business with another company you own   the truth is sears is drowning in debt   the ceo offered an easy out   they sell the property and only pay reduced rent   it also means closing stores is easier and sears is on the decline   so on its own it 's shady but not the worst way of getting quick cash   the fact that the ceo is responsible for that decline is what pushes things into potential legal trouble   it 's essentially a complicated form of theft   one where if sears goes bankrupt too early before 2020 or so his real estate business ca n't handle it and burns   however these sorts of executive theft are almost never prosecuted   the best chance would be a shareholder lawsuit but it would have to be against the entire board for supporting him   then you run into the issue that while the board is elected the laws governing it allow for tricks that make the russian election look sterling in   basically if a ceo is backed up by the board and not doing something blatantly illegal they can probably get away with it   board elections tend to be rigged to the point that having a member that cares about the company and all the minor shareholders is laughable   in addition to how the candidates are chosen votes are cast etc etc many companies have several types of shares   some of which have no voting power and some of which count for many times the vote of a normal share

one of the things i love to do is to find big patterns in things when an effect is the result of human decisions then since people are involved in lots of stuff you should generally be able to find large of behavior    in this case it 's really who moved my cheese over and over we see industries that fear change and fight the change with lawsuits and dirty tricks this can be traced down to the idea that a large number of managers and executives are n't that creative but know how to their way into jobs it 's not what you know while i doubt they would recognize this the threat of market scares them because they do n't know how to deal with it it introduces fear uncertainty and doubt so they use the tools they know lawyers    in the meantime the pages jeff bezos steve jobs and reed hastings of the world see the brilliant path and essentially duck through the giant 's legs not all the time mind you ask

the definite answer if you want to give a larger amount of money is ask the charity just drop them a mail with something like dear i 've decided to donate you $ 1,000,000 because i like what you do could you please tell me which option is more convenient and less costly for you i can do either an online debit credit card payment send you a check by mail or make a bank transfer cross out whichever you ca n't do i 'm looking forward to hearing from you yours faithfully even if you give just $ 2,000 it 's surely enough to be worth for them writing you a reply and clarifying whichever way they prefer so you do n't waste neither their time nor the money this way

no getting more credit lowers your credit utilization ratio if you do n't use it which raises your credit rating this can also be done by asking for a higher limit on your existing credit card also there is a chance that the company you got your first card from wo n't pull your credit a second time when they go to the underwriter as any extensions of credit lower your credit score although the credit utilization ratio is weighted more heavily

word from a designer i know many garments produced by american apparel at the end of mr. charney 's reign were overpriced poorly often with un un finished edges sometimes little more than a piece of stretch fabric fashioned into a tube or a large rectangle sized and fit to the customer   also the advertisements and commercials featured hyper semi models who were often regular employees   it seemed to be an innovative way to run such a business but doing that sort of thing in la is quite possibly the wrong model nowadays   a year or two back the la times ran a story about some la clothing manufacturers leaving the city and relocating to el tx
