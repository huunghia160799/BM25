the fact that your shares are of a canadian listed corporation as indicated in your comment reply and that you are located in the united states as indicated in your bio is highly relevant to answering the question the restriction for needing to be a qualified institutional buyer arises from the parent company not having registered the spin off company rights options or shares yet for sale in the united states shares sold in the u.s. must either be registered with the sec or qualify for some exemption see sec fast answers securities act rule 144 quoting selling restricted or control securities in the marketplace can be a    complicated process this is because the sales are so close to the    interests of the issuing company that the law might require them to be    registered under section 5 of the securities act of 1933 all offers    and sales of securities must be registered with the sec or qualify for    some exemption from the registration requirements there are regulations to follow and costs involved in such registration perhaps the rights options themselves wo n't ever be registered as they have a very limited lifetime while the listed shares might be you could contact investor relations at the parent company for more detail if i guessed the company correctly there 's detail in this press release search the text for united states

accredited investors are required to have 1 million in assets not including primary residence or $ income for the last 3 years these kinds of regulations come from the sec not the company involved which means the sec thinks it 's a risky investment if i recall correctly someone i know had to submit evidence of being an accredited investor to trade options on his ira it may be that this is related to the classification of the options

indeed the correlation has been across all stocks and even branching out to other asset classes on a lot of days   as a sort of hedge i like to use high yielding dividend stocks as my trading vehicles   if all stocks are going to trade in tandem i may as well have downside protection built in   dividends do that   i gain from a churning market and if i get the macro wrong then i can double or even triple down for the div yield   i like it so far no holes in the plan have formed up   been working well for a couple of years   as far as the macro i think the correlation to the euro will break if italy gets past its late january 12 auction   my whole thesis falls apart if that auction does not snap the capital markets like a   i 'd have to get more bullish overall   if they also get past the big auction then i think the euro will be convincingly out of the woods

first what structure does your index fund have   if it is an open end mutual fund there are no bid ask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price   if it is an exchange traded fund then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well   this is where you have to get into the creation and redemption unit construct of the exchange traded fund where there are in kind transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund   in either case you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that do n't make sense given how these are built index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs   if you want suggested reading on this look at the investing books of john c. bogle who studied some of this rather extensively in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as bogle 's where a couple of key ones would be common sense on mutual funds new for the intelligent investor and bogle on mutual funds new perspectives for the intelligent investor in the case of an open end fund there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully re invested and other matters that make this quite easy to note   vanguard 500 index investor has in cash as an example here where you could look at any open end mutual fund 's portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed   it ’s the execution stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of tracking error or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases there can be a little bit of active management in the fund just as a minor side note when i lived in the us i did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment   i 'd still recommend them though i 'd argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind how is its price set then the price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares   the price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask similar pricing for bonds held by the fund derivatives and cash equivalents   similarly the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees brokerage costs etc is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads or does    it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply demand laws there is n't any spread used in determining the net asset value for the fund   the fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks the liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund that most items have to come down to either being an asset something with a positive value or a liability something with a negative value something to consider also is the size of the fund   with over $ in assets a .01 amount is still $ 700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways

if you are the beneficiary of an annuity you might receive a single sum distribution when the annuity owner dies the amount of this death benefit might be the current cash value of the annuity or some other amount based upon contract riders that the owner purchased the tax on death benefits depends on a number of factors death benefits are taxed as normal income unlike other investments the named beneficiary of a non qualified annuity does not get a step up in tax basis to the date of death however that does n't mean the beneficiary will have to pay taxes on the full amount because the purchaser of the annuity made the investment with after tax dollars only the amount attributable to investment income is taxed but it will be taxed as ordinary income and not enjoy any special capital gains treatment when there is a death benefit that exceeds the value of the account that additional amount is also taxed as ordinary income   taxes on annuities depend on several circumstances for more information on distribution of inherited annuities and taxes go to annuities they go into details that could help you even more   one thing that annuities hq points out is if you take the lump sum payout you may be pushed into a higher tax bracket   along with doing research i would also contact a financial advisor

there is unlimited risk in taking a naked call option position   the only risk in taking a covered call position is that you will be required to sell your shares for less than the going market price i do n't entirely agree with the accepted answer given here   you would not lose the amount you paid to buy the shares naked call option suppose take a naked call option position by selling a call option since there is no limit on how high the price of the underlying share can go you can be forced to either buy back the option at a very high price or in the case that the option is exercised you can be force to buy the underlying shares at a very high price and then sell them to the option holder at a very low price for example suppose you sell an apple call option with a strike price of $ 100 at a premium of $ 2.50 and for this you receive a payment of $ 250 now if the price of apple skyrockets to say $ 1000 then you would either have to buy back the option for about $ 90,000 = 100 x $ or if the holder exercised the option then you would need to buy 100 apple shares at the market price of $ 1000 per share costing you $ 100,000 and then sell them to the option holder at the strike price of $ 100 for $ 10,000 = 100 x $ 100   in either case you would show a loss of $ 90,000 on the share transaction which would be slightly offset by a $ 250 credit for the premium you received selling the call   there is no limit on the potential loss since there is no limit on how high the underlying share price can go covered call option consider now the case of a covered call option   since you hold the underlying shares any loss you make on the option position would be covered by the profit you make on the underlying shares again suppose you own 100 apple shares and sell a call option with a strike price of $ 100 at a premium of $ 2.50 to earn a payment of $ 250 if the price of apple skyrockets to $ 1000 then there are again two possible scenarios one you buy back the option at a premium of about $ 900 costing you $ 90,000   in order to cover this cost you would then sell your 100 apple shares at the market price of $ 1000 per share to realise $ 100,000 = 100 x $ 1000   on the other hand if your option is exercised then you would deliver your 100 apple shares to the option holder at the contracted strike price of $ 100 per share thus receiving just $ 10,000 = 100 x $ 100   the only loss is that you have had to sell your shares for much less than the market price

you can split payments and nobody judges you because most prepaid cards are actually gift cards   they just think you have generous friends    when you use visa mc at a vendor they get dinged around 2 3 plus 35 cents flat rate   so when you ask them to charge 77 cents to the card you 're essentially asking they give half of it to visa mc   which is unfair   a charity wo n't turn it down but it 's wasted   so how do you solve this problem   if you see a small merchant using square or paypal here their merchant agreements charge a flat rate 2.75 and respectively with no flat rate per transaction   if you see they are on paypal square go for it    obviously paypal itself does n't have that problem because they have a really really good deal with visa and mastercard   so feel free to buy yourself credit on your paypal account with these residual values    amazon probably has a similar deal    you are getting these small amounts because you aim to pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 25 on it   reasonable but it causes this    flip it around pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 20 on it consume the $ 20 value and pay the $ in cash   you may need to tell the cashier exactly the amount to charge e.g. $ 20.00 especially if it is a visa mc card   it will certainly go faster if you do   the cashier may be able to pull up the balance but it 's an extra procedure and an inexperienced cashier may struggle with it have to call the manager etc not worth it in my book

unfortunately the answer is almost none almost everything has a risk of decreasing but given your short time horizon and presumably given that you want back your principal in full plus a little bit you have few choices some of the following may be canadian specific terms but hopefully they are generic enough to apply savings accounts money market funds and the like should be available at any bank   interest wo n't pay you much right now but the money should be safe i presume israel has some kind of deposit insurance for normal bank accounts slightly more risky would be a short to maturity bond or stripped bond coupon   the entry amount of money for one of these may be more than you have on hand or the setup fee for an investment account might be more than you want to bother with for a one off investment given that you seem to indicate that you might need access to the money during the time frame in question the bank account option seems to be the only one really available

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

good course or book that goes deeper in quant math    there are quite a few courses and books out there that cover finance and math what i have observed is that online courses tend to be high level introduce concepts like option pricing greeks etc but does not necessarily go into details of the math behind them there are some books which cover these eg hull book paul etc however they are better as reference books rather than book that you can learn in a structured way     can someone recommend a course free or paid that goes into details of the finance math including concepts like local vol stochastic vol derivation of   black scholes pricing of barriers var swaps etc ideally these books should introduce low level concepts probability etc have some worked examples and slowly build up into higher level concepts     thanks in advance

assuming that a person has good financial discipline and is generally responsible with spending i think that having a few hundred or thousand dollars extra of available credit is usually worth more to that person for the choice flexibility it provides in unforeseen circumstance versus the relatively minor hit that could be taken to their credit score

this is somewhat of a non answer but i 'm not sure you 'll ever find a satisfying answer to this question because the premises on which the question is based on are flawed   money itself does not exist physically at least not in the same sense that a product you buy does it simply does not make sense to say that you physically own money you can build a product out of but you can not build a money out of if you could then you could print your own money actually you can try to print your own money but nobody would knowingly accept it and thus is it functionally to real money the paper has no intrinsic value its value is derived from the fact that other people perceive it as valuable and nowhere else ergo paper money is no different than electronic money it is for this reason that if i were you i would be okay with online forex trading

there are deals out there which allow refinancing up to 125 of appraised value so long as you have a solid payment history you need to research banks in your area working with harp funded mortgages   an alternate method is to find a bank that will finance 80 of the current value at 4 and the rest as a heloc the rate will be higher on the equity line but the average rate will be better and you can pay the line off faster

many people who do transfer a balance from one credit card to another have no clue as to what is going on and how credit cards work if you transfer a balance from one credit card to another you are charged a fee of anywhere from 3 upwards subject to a minimum of $ 10 or so up front if credit card a has balance $ 1000 and you transfer it to credit card b which is offering no interest for a year on the transferred balance you owe credit card b $ 1050 say in most cases that $ 50 has to be paid off as part of the following month 's bill if you are carrying a revolving balance on credit card b that $ 50 will typically be charged interest from the day of the transfer your monthly bill will not necessarily include that $ 1000   you owe for one year or six months or whatever the transfer agreement you accepted says if you tend to pay anything less even a penny than   full payment of each month 's bill on credit card b your partial payment will be applied to that $ 1000 first and anything left over will be applied to the monthly balance in short if you do n't pay in full each month that $ 1000 will not be yours for a year you may end up paying $ 50 interest for   borrowing $ 1000 for just one or two months and the rest of your balance is the gift that keeps on giving as the credit card company likes to say update this has changed slightly in the united states any amount paid over the minimum amount due is charged to the higher interest balances so in this case if you had $ 1000 at a 0 promotional rate and a regular balance of $ 500 and the minimum payment was $ 100 and you paid $ 150 $ 100 would pay down the promotional balance and the extra $ 50 would pay down the regular balance   about the only way to make the deal work in your favor is to transfer money only if you have paid the full amount due    on the last two statements before the date of the transfer and are    not carrying a revolving balance check your monthly statements    to make sure they show finance charge of 0.00   many people have    never seen such a sight and are unaware that this can be observed    in nature make sure that you pay each month 's bill in full not    the minimum monthly payment due each month for a whole year    after that make sure that the bill containing that $ 1000 coming out a    year after the transfer date is also paid in full very many credit card users do not have the financial discipline to go through with this program   that is why credit card companies love to push transfer balances on consumers the whole thing is a cash cow for them where they in effect get to charge usurious rates of interest without running afoul of the law $ 50 interest for a one year loan of $ 1000 is pretty high at current rates $ 50 interest for a two or three month loan where the customer does not even notice the screwing he is getting is called laughing all the way to the bank see also the answers to   this question

if you want to deposit checks or conduct business at a window you should look at a local savings bank or credit union generally you can find one that will offer free checking in exchange for direct deposit or a minimum balance some are totally free but those banks pay for interest if you do n't care about location i would look at charles schwab bank i 've been using them for a couple of years and have been really satisfied with them they provide free checking atm fee reimbursement free checks and pre paid deposit envelopes you also can easily move money between schwab brokerage or savings accounts other brokers offer similar services as well

i do n't believe saturday is a business day either when i deposit a check at a bank 's drive in after 4 pm friday the receipt tells me it will credit as if i deposited on monday   if a business computer does n't adjust their billing to have a weekday due date they are supposed to accept the payment on the next business day else as you discovered a sunday due date is really the prior friday in which case they may be running afoul of the rules that require x number of days from the time they mail a bill to the time it 's due   the flip side to all of this is to pick and choose your battles in life just pay the bill 2 days early the interest on a few hundred dollars is a few cents per week you save that by not using a stamp just charge it on their site on the friday keep in mind you can be right but their computer still you so you call and spend your valuable time when ever the due date is over a weekend getting an agent to reverse the late fee the cost of right is wasting ten minutes which is worth far more than just avoiding the issue altogether   but if you are in the us you did n't give your country we have regulations for everything hr aka the card act of 2009 offers 2 weekend or holiday due dates if the payment due date for a    credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan is a day on    which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail    including weekends and holidays the creditor may not treat a    payment received on the next business day as late for any purpose so if you really want to pursue this you have the power of our congress on your side

you should certainly look into investments if you do n't expect to need the money until retirement then i 'd put it in an ira so you get the tax advantages it makes sense to keep some money handy just in case but $ 23k is a very large amount of money for an emergency fund of course much depends on your life situation but i 'm hard pressed to think of an unexpected emergency that would come up that would require $ 23k if you 're seriously planning to go back to school then you might want to put the money in a non retirement fund investment as i write this september 2015 the stock market is falling so if you expect to need the money within the next few months putting it in the stock market may be a mistake but long term the stock market has always gone up so it will almost certainly recover sooner or later the question is just when investing versus paying off debts is a difficult decision what is the interest rate on the debt if it 's more than you 're likely to make on an investment then you should pay off the debt first my broker recently told me that over the last few decades the stock market has averaged 7 annual growth so i 'm using that as my working number if the interest rate is low some people still prefer to pay off the debt because the interest is certain while the return on an investment is uncertain and they 're unwilling to take the risk

a fascinating view on this the math of a 10 deposit and projected 10 return lead to an inevitable point when the account is worth 10x your income nice and the deposit 10 of income only represents 1 of the account balance   the use of an ira is neither here nor there as your proposed deposit is still just 1 of your retirement account total pay off debt for one with this level of savings it should be assumed you are n't carrying any high interest debt   it really depends on your age and retirement budget our number was our final income so at 10x we were still saving for you if you project hitting your number soon enough i 'd still deposit to the match but maybe no more it might be time to just enjoy the extra money for others their goal may be much higher and those extra years deposits are still needed i 'd play with a spreadsheet and see the impact of reduced retirement account deposits note the question asks about funding the 401(k vs paying down debt i 'd always advise to deposit to the match but beyond that one should focus on their high interest debt especially by their 50 's

you are really showing some wisdom here and congratulations on finishing college    its a lot about   if you buy a new car there is something like a chance you will get a car that will not need repairs   if you buy a car for $ 1200 there is probably a 20 chance that the car will only need minimal repairs   so the answer is there is no real guarantee that spending any amount of money you will end up with a car with no repairs you also ca n't assume that with buying a car it will immediately need repairs   its possible that you could spend 1200 on a car and it will need an oil change   in three months it might need brakes and in 6 months tires   if that is the case you could save up the money for repairs have you looked for a car   it will take some work but you might be able to find something in good condition for your budget    if you shop for a loan go with a good credit union or local bank   mostly you are looking for a low rate   however i would advise against it   you worked so hard on getting out of school without debt why start now    be weird and buy a car for cash   heck someone may be able to loan you a car for a short time while you save some money

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

incremental profit not revenue if the incremental profit i project from an additional hire is greater than the cost taxes drive the cost up and the profit down depending on the tax saying i will hire no matter what taxes are levied against me is just as ridiculous as saying i will not hire if one cent is levied against me    at the end of the day profits are the source of future expansion and investment we are not publicly traded taxes effectively reduce the amount we have left to invest they do not reduce this amount to zero but they do reduce it    you are right to imply that i want the business to grow constantly but that requires investment of actual money before the top or bottom line impact happens months or years in advance sometimes you take a risk that does n't pan out and that money is gone forever sometimes it develops into a profitable segment of the business in wither case taxes reduce the chunk of change we can use for this kind of activity   i sense latent hostility in your phrasing but i hope i am wrong it feels like you are accusing me of making a profit but i openly admit to making a profit i do not view this as something bad it is profitability that allows me to increase salary and benefit levels for employees try to continually improve working conditions invest in new equipment spend on to make better products and of course increase my personal income   i try to align the way in which i make money personally with constantly making customers and employees happier happy customers means more revenue and happy employees means better processes better ideas and more profit i do n't view this as bad and i hope i read emotion into your comment that you did not mean if so i apologize in advance but if you did mean to be hostile i hope you at least understand where i am coming from now   edit grammar

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

if your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts i see a better option have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation   example the house is worth 400 now he can borrow 100 against that he spends it on the addition making the house worth 500 with the same 400 of equity as before in some cases spending 100 might add 150 to the house value but let 's assume here the increase is just what was spent when he dies the mortgage has to be repaid if he has no other money that the two of you would otherwise split then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash so you pay your brother 250 half the new total value of the house but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage you also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage net result your brother has 200 the same as if he had inherited half the house and you have a 500 house after paying out 300 your gain is also the same as if the house was now if the house went up 150 by spending 100 or went up 60 by spending 100 you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss if you do n't want that to happen you will need a different agreement the advantage of the approach i 'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies   not accounted for in this is that you lived without paying rent in your father 's house for some time and that you worked without being paid as a caregiver to your father for that time some families might think those two things balanced others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not

stock awards by employers are treated and taxed as salary i.e. you pay ordinary rate income tax fica taxes state taxes etc the fact that you got your salary in shares and not cash is irrelevant for tax purposes once you got the shares and paid your taxes on them the treatment is the same as if you got the salary and immediately bought the shares holding period for capital gains tax purposes starts at the time you paid your taxes on the award which is the time at which you get full ownership i.e. vesting time for the restricted stocks when you sell these stocks you treat the sale as any other stock sale you check the holding period for capital gains tax rates and you do not pay or get refund any fica taxes on the sales transaction so bottom line you got $ 10 k salary and you bought $ 10 k worth of company stock and you sold it at $ 8 k half a year later you have $ 10 k wages income and $ 2 k short term capital loss

credit risk and insurance risk are highly correlated for a single legal party   trouble with one could indicate trouble with another any increase in credit risk such as new borrowing will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of insurance risk manifested as a fraudulent or subconsciously induced claim   any claim of insurance will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of default manifested as a default voluntary or not to a creditor insurer only the law applies therefore private arrangements between the borrower insured and third parties do not factor because the creditor insurer has no hope of recourse against such third parties in most places around the world regardless of whether there is a price ceiling on compensation for damages to assets limiting an insurers costs if a risk is realized then it can be presumed through sequential sampling as well as other reliable statistical techniques that future risk has risen   the aforementioned risk dominoes subsequently fall generally speaking the lower one 's financial variance the lower the financial costs   in other words uncertainty can be mostly quantified with variance and other mathematical moments as well   any uncertainty is a cost to a producer thus a cost to the consumer   a consumer who is perfectly predictable with good outcomes will pay much lower costs on average than not so one who keeps a tight financial ship not exposing oneself to financial risks and better yet not realizing financial risks will see less financial variance thus will enjoy lower costs to financing which includes insuring

hmrc may or may not find out about it the risks and penalties involved if they do find out make it unwise not to just declare it and pay the tax on it based on the fact you asked the question i am assuming that you currently pay all your tax through paye and do n't do a tax return you would need to register for self assessment and complete a return this is not at all difficult if your tax situation is straightforward which it sounds like yours is then you would owe the tax on the additional money at whatever applicable rate which depends on how much you earn in your main job the rate tables are here if it truly is a one off you could simply declare it on your return as other income but if it is more than that then you would need to look at setting up as self employed there is some good advice on the differences here   broadly you are likely to be running a business if you have a regular organised activity with a profit motive which continues for at least a few months if the work is one off or very occasional say a few times per year or not very organised or of very low value say under £ 2,000 per year then it might qualify as casual income if you think it is beyond the definition of casual income then you would also need to pay national insurance as described in the previous link but otherwise the tax treatment would be the same

do you now own your new home or are you renting   this is a classic case of a mortgage ready to blow up these interest only would have a low rate say 3 so on $ 200 k the payment is $ 500/mo but no principal paydown even if the rate were still 3 it wo n't be the 23 yr amortization means a payment of $ after the 7 years end at 4 it 's $ 5 $ i would take this all into account as you decide what to do if you now own a new house you should consider the morally questionable walk away i believe you were sold an unethical product mb wrote shoot up considerably this is still an understatement a product whose payment is certain to double in a fixed time is bad bad in the biblical sense you have no obligation to keep any deal with the devil which is exactly what you have   there are some banks offering fha products that might help you i just received an offer from the bank holding a mortgage on my rental property it 's 4.5 for a refinance up to 125 of current value there 's a cost of $ 1800 but i owe so little and am paying it off faster than the time left i 'm not bothering you may benefit from such a program but i 'd still question if you can make a go of a house that even 2 underwater do some math and see if you started now with a 30 year loan how the numbers work out   forgive my soapbox stance on this there are those who criticize the strategic i think you fall into a group of innocent victims who were sold a product that was nothing less than a financial time bomb i am very curious to know the original interest only rate and the index margin for the rate upon adjustment if you include the original balance i can tell you the exact payments based on the new rates pretty easily

the main risk i see to this plan is with a late payment to your credit card   for a variety of reasons some outside your control you could end up with a late payment on the cc and a + 18 interest rate making your arbitrage attempts unprofitable you sense that this is risky and it derives from placing short term risk on a long term asset    your interest rate is high for the current market   what kind of things can you do reduce that rate   what kind of things can you do to reduce your principle   those kind of things represent far less risk and accomplish the same goal

there are specific cases where you are required to use ads required use of ads    you must use ads for the following property listed property used 50 or less in a qualified business use see chapter 5 for information on listed property any tangible property used predominantly outside the united states during the year any tax exempt use property any tax exempt bond financed property all property used predominantly in a farming business and placed in service in any tax year during which an election not to apply the    uniform capitalization rules to certain farming costs is in effect any property imported from a foreign country for which an executive order is in effect because the country maintains trade    restrictions or engages in other discriminatory acts see publication if none of those apply to your property you may elect ads why would you elect ads when you 're not required to use it if you ca n't think of a reason then do n't elect it for most people the shorter the depreciation period the more they can deduct or accumulate in passive losses each year and that is usually the desirable case if you plan on selling in 10 years keep in mind the depreciation recapture and consider whether the passive losses offsetting regular income are worth the extra tax in this case

as one answer points out people buying cards care little about whether they cost 25 cents or $ 5   those are both small amounts of money and it 's not something you buy often also people feel the need to spend money because it 's a gift on the supplier side it should be noted that the cost of cards has little to do with the paper they are printed on   there is an expectation that cards are new and unique something the buyer and recipient have never seen   so they have writers and graphic designers constantly out a large variety of cards and replacing existing cards with new ones of which only a small number get sold before they move to the next model   relatively speaking there is a lot of human effort per thousand cards sold   then of course there is the real estate they occupy in the store disproportionate to a bunch of pieces of paper and other retail marketing and distribution costs   i 'm not saying margins are particularly thin but if they were crazy high we probably would see more entry as you suggest

obviously the only way to have good credit is by owing money and making payments as scheduled to do this i would do everything i could to place all of your required expenses on a credit card this can include paying rent food transportation etc   these are all payments that you already make but simply move then through a different payment vehicle it sounds like at this time you may not have a credit card that allows you to do this but i would watch out for those cards that come in via mail with all kinds of special deals while you have not mentioned if you have any of this make sure that you keep up with your past debt and negotiate repayment if needed once your credit improves you should begin to see doors opening that are problems now

since it 's not tagged united states i 'd like to offer a more general advice your emergency fund should match the financial risks that are relevant to you the two main classes of financial risk are of course a sudden increase in costs or a decrease in income you 'd have to address both independently first loss of income for most this would simply equate to the loss of a job how much benefits would you expect to get and for how long this is often the most important question the 6 months advise in the us is based on a lack of benefits   with two incomes you 're less likely to lose both jobs at the same time that 's a general advise though if you both work for the same employer the risk of losing two jobs at the same time is certainly real also in countries with little protection against dismissal such as the us the chance of being off at the same time is also higher on the debit side there are also two main risks the first is the loss or failure of an essential possession i.e. one which requires immediate replacement this could include a car or a washing machine you already paid for one before so you should have a good idea how much it costs the second expenditure risk is health related costs those can suddenly crop up but often you have some kind of insurance if not you 'd need to account for some costs but it 's hard to come up with an objective number here the two categories are dependent of course health related costs may very well coincide with a loss of income especially if you 're self employed now once you 've figured out what the risks are it 's time to figure out how to insure against them insurance might be a better choice than an emergency fund especially for the health costs you might even discover that you do n't need an emergency fund at all in large parts of europe you could establish a credit margin that 's not easily revoked i.e. overdraft agreements and unemployment benefits are sufficient to cover your regular cost of living the main risk would then be a sudden lack of liquidity if your employer goes bankrupt and fails to pay the monthly wages which means your credit should be guaranteed sufficient to borrow one month of expenses this of course assumes quite good credit pay off my car does n't suggest that

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

depending on where you live in the uk buying a house sooner might be a better option i would echo the advice about putting some money away into a rainy day fund etc above but i know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7 per year i bought a house two years ago and i 'm paying 4 interest on my mortgage so i 'm effectively making money by owning my house   given that you want to buy a house if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest you 're effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices meaning you 'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £ 4k in lawyers fees surveys mortgage setup fees etc and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a of the sale cost if you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. london where house prices are currently skyrocketing if you do n't want to live in the house you may be able to do a buy to let as an investment generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent property management company 's fees so while you wo n't see any actual net income the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you 'll be building equity on the home it 's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc

i would not claim to be a personal expert in rental property i do have friends and family and acquaintances who run rental units for additional income and/or make a full time living at the rental business   as joetaxpayer points out rentals are a cash eating business you need to have enough liquid funds to endure uncertainty with maintenance and vacancy costs often a leveraged rental will show high roi or cagr but that must be balanced by your overall risk and liquidity position i have been told that a good rule of thumb is to buy in cash with a target roi of 10 of course ymmv and might not be realistic for your market it may require you to do some serious bargain hunting which seems reasonable based on the stagnant market you described some examples the main point here is assessing the risk associated with financing real estate the roi or cagr of a financed property looks great but consider the net income a few expensive maintenance events or vacancies will quickly get you to a negative cash flow multiply this by a few rentals and your risk exposure is multiplied too   note that i did not factor in appreciation based on op information cash purchase with some very rough estimates based on op example net income = rent tax = $ per year finance purchase rough estimate with 20 down net income = rent tax = $ 7500 per year

this may sound very tongue in cheek but the best thing you can invest in is to raise your income in order to increase your retirement savings   how much are you able to contribute to retirement now   i think you would be lucky to do $ and most months probably less than that   however if you were making like 60k year and allowed a little lifestyle bloat you could probably easy put away 20k year   once you are able to do that the savings you can manage now will be quickly    often times when people consider having their money work for them they often neglect to factor risk   prior to investing one should have a proper emergency fund in place   that is 6 months or so of living expenses in a nice safe savings account   those earn about 1.25 these days which is pretty meager but it does earn something    once the emergency fund is in place one can invest with impunity   without it you will have to liquidate investments if economic calamity strikes you   this could be done at a loss furthering the harm done by the calamity    increase your income and create an emergency fund   do those things first

sensitive topic inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand   in an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods    we do n't live in an ideal world one example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy from companies that demand   most recently we 've seen wheat prices rise as fires outside moscow damaged the harvest and the russian government banned exports and that introduces the danger of inflation inflation is a signal like the pain you feel after an injury   if you simply took a you may completely ignore a broken leg until took your life governments sometimes ban inflation by fixing prices   both the and venezuelan governments have tried this recently   the consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production as pointed out governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation there is a correct level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called inflation where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6 the reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption   with a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas   consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow if prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity   if prices rise to quickly as in zimbabwe and venezuela then people can not save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all   innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices   it can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the apple iphone new types of medicines and so on the best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism   inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts we hide from it at our peril

please do not conflate number of credit cards with amount of debt consider two scenarios the latter scenario yields much better credit scoring many recommendation sources suggest the following although your credit score seems very important it is only important when you have financial interactions such as applying for credit or services where the other party makes decisions based upon the score you should only obtain loans and credit when you want and it makes sense based upon your needs choosing to live your life to serve credit scoring agencies may not be your happy place

first you are not exactly giving the brokerage $ 2000 that money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises if you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $ 6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $ 30/share sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account the way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines it is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse if you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower in your example you are selling 200 shares at $ 20 and later buying those at $ 19 thus your profit is $ 200 not counting any interest or fees you have paid it 's a bit confusing because you are selling something you 'll buy in the future selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially if i sell at $ 20/share the most i can make is if the stock declines to $ 0   your potential to lose is unlimited in theory there is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so i could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss   i used $ 20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order if you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway if someone says i would like to give you $ 20 for that item you are selling you are n't likely to tell them no i 'd really only like $ 19 for it

the responses here are excellent i 'd add just a couple points debt is not generic it ranges from low my heloc is 2.5 to insane 24 credit card anyone   when i read about the obsession to be completely debt free i ask questions are you saving in your 401(k at least up to the match i disagree with the debt is evil people who advise to ignore retirement savings while paying off every last debt my company offers a dollar for dollar match on the first 5 of income deposited so a $ 60 k earner will see a $ 3000 deposit doubled 5 years of this and he has 1/2 a year 's income in his retirement account more with positive returns note for those so fearful of losses all 401(k accounts have to offer a fixed income low risk choice currently 1 or less but the opposite of i can lose it all after that paying off the higher debt is great when it 's time to hack away at student debt and mortgage i am concerned that if it 's at the risk of having no savings i 'd hold off consider two people in homes worth $ 250k. one has a mortgage of $ 250 k and $ 100 k in the bank the other has his mortgage paid down to $   when they lose their jobs the guy with the $ 100 k in the bank has the funds to float himself through a period of unemployment as well as a house the bank is less likely to foreclose on the guy with no money is in deep trouble and the bank can sell his house for $ 150 k and run away after proper foreclosure proceedings of course my mortgage is one bill like any other and only a bit more than my property tax i do n't lose sleep over it it will be paid before i retire and before my old is off to college i do n't think you stupid for paying your low interest debt at your own pace

yes you should take in the expenses being incurred by the mutual fund this   lists down the fees charged by the mutual fund and where expenses can be found in the annual statement of the fund to calculate fees and expenses as you might expect fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a low cost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time you do n't pay expenses so the money is taken from the assets of the fund so you pay it indirectly if the expenses are huge that may point to something i.e. fund managers are enjoying at your expense money is being used somewhere else rather than being paid as dividends if the expenses are used in the growth of the fund that is a positive sign else you can expect the fund to be downgraded or upgraded by the credit rating agencies depending on how the credit rating agencies see the expenses of the fund and other factors generally comparison should be done with funds invested in the same sectors same distribution of assets so that you have a homogeneous comparison to make else it would be unwise to compare between a fund invested in oil companies and other in computers yes the economy is inter but that is not how a comparison should be done

all excellent answers   scott w. already mentioned to look out for sales and many other answers are ways to be smart with portions   do n't or be smart with bulk buys but i 'm surprised nobody mentioned one of the things i 'd consider obvious about saving money on groceries   coupons coupons can save cash   we 'll sometimes use coupons for brands we 'd be buying anyway or other comparably priced brands that we 're willing to try   the thing to be careful of with coupons is when the manufacturer is attempting to up sell you to a premium brand or trying to get you to buy a product you 'd never have bought anyway anyway we especially like the coupons that costco sends in the mail once in a while or those they hand out at the warehouse entrance   what better way to save than to all the better if the items are n't perishable   when we have the space and those grocery savings stars are all in alignment we load up on such items as paper towels cereal bars soap etc

admittedly i was starting to form a similar opinion as it seems like the sales team spends most of their time going drinking and golfing with customers or potential customers i am sure there must be more to it than that but their conversations would also suggest that their job performance is largely about who they know and less about real talent it could be just what i hear though maybe they do n't like to showcase their talents   i have no complaints about my job company environment management salary etc

mutual funds generally have a minimum amount you must start with to own any of the fund for vanguard funds they have a $ 1,000 minimum for certain target date funds and $ 3,000 for most everything else what you would do is open an account at vanguard or other brokerage that handles vanguard funds and send them a check for $ 3,000 after it clears you can specify which fund you want it to go into and it buys what the price at end of day was divided into your account balance number of shares fractional share are fine and your balance will not usually be an even number of shares most brokerages will let you set up an automatic transfer where some amount out of your paycheck is put into your account each pay period you can specify which of the funds you own it goes into once you 've got the minimum to be in the fund you can add whatever amount you like each month

i 'd say only look for business opportunities in areas where you have quite a lot of specific knowledge or the ability to learn from someone who already has it   further particularly in a saturated market like the one you describe you need to have a clear idea of how you 're going to be better than other players   it 's not enough to just want to do something to make money   you need a solid plan and a solid angle on how you 're going to be better than others   if you do n't have those things yet for what you 're looking at do more research until you do   if you never get there do n't bother   you 're essentially saying you want to exploit arbitrage opportunities which is a legitimate way to make a living but it requires a lot of market knowledge because there are probably millions of people doing the exact same thing

everyone buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price no matter who you are there are a few important things you need to understand example eve bid 16.00 eve ask so if your selling eve at market price you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid $ 16.00 if you buy eve at market price you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price $ its key to understand this rule an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask so a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ask price meets his bid price when you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade so it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask

while jb king says some useful things i think there is another fundamental reason why stock markets go down after disasters either natural or man made   there is a real impact on the markets in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport higher security costs closer inspections on trade goods tighter restrictions on visas real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people and eventually the cost of a war but almost as important is the uncertainty and risk nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that is there going to be another one a week later or every week for the next year will air travel become essentially impractical will international trade be severely restricted all those would have a huge massive effect on the economy you may argue that those things are very unlikely even after something like 9/11 but even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling there is another thing that drives the market down even if most people are sure that there wo n't be a catastrophic economic crash they know that other people think there might be and so will sell that will drive the market down if they know the market is going down then sensible traders will start to sell even if they think there is zero risk of a crash this makes the effect worse eventually prices will drop so far that the people who do n't think there is a crash will start to buy so they can make a profit on the recovery but that usually does n't happen until there has been a substantial drop

illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low priced over the counter otc securities with low volumes open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm basically you ca n't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid otc stock without facing a fee you 'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the average volume if you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stock 's average volume over the last 20 days you 'll also be assessed a fee the first link i included above is just an example but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client   this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits technically these fees are assessed to the clearing firm not the individual investor but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s that triggered the restriction also remember that when buying otc pink sheet stocks your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from sell to if you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future but there are n't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price or even at all

great answer by only thing to add is that the option itself becomes a tradeable asset here 's my go at filling out the answer from hey kid so you have this brand new video game manic that you paid $ 50 for on jan 1st that you want to sell two months from now yes mr. video game broker but i want to lock in a price so i know how much to save for a new tickle me for my baby sister ok for $ 3 i 'll sell you a put option so you can sell the game to me for $ 40 in two months kid says ok sends $ 3 to mr game broker who sends our kid a piece of paper saying the holder of this piece of paper can sell the game manic to mr game broker for $ 40 on march 1st one month later news comes out that manic is full of bugs and the price in the shops is heavily discounted to $ 30 mr options trader realizes that our kid holds a contract written by mr game broker which effectively allows our kid to sell the game at $ 10 over the price of the new game so maybe about $ 15 over the price in the second hand market which he might be about $ 25 on march 1st he calls up our kid hey kid you know that put option that mr game broker sold to you you a month ago wanna sell it to me for $ 13 he wants to get it a couple of bucks cheaper than his $ 15 fair valuation kid thinks   hmmm that would be a $ 10 net profit for me on that put option but i would n't be able to sell the game for $ 40 next month i 'd likely only get something like $ 25 for it so i would kind of be getting $ 10 now rather than potentially getting $ 12 in a month note the $ 12 is because there could be $ 15 from exercising the put option selling for $ 40 a game worth only $ 25 in the second hand market minus the original cost of $ 3 for the put option kid likes the idea and replies done next day kid sends the put option contract to mr options trader and receives $ 13 in return our kid bought the put option and later sold it for a profit and all of this happened before the option reached its expiry date

in the us and in most other countries dividends are considered income when paid and capital gains losses are considered income loss when realized this is called in accounting recognition we recognize income when cash reaches our pocket for tax purposes so for dividends it is when they 're paid and for gains when you actually sell assuming the price of that fund never changes you have this math do to when you sell of course the capital loss gain may change by the time you actually sell and realize it but assuming the only price change is due to the dividends payout it 's a wash

when you have multiple assets available and a risk free asset cash or borrowing you will always end up them if you have a reasonable objective function   however you seem to have constrained yourself to 100 investment   combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio   the fact that you describe the us fund as dominating the fund indicates that this may be the case for you   ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset dominates another but it may not in your special case notice that these funds are both already highly diversified so all you are getting is cross border diversification by getting more than one   that may be why you are getting the solution you are   i 've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy with some reliable results   fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones   however getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible   unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs   for that reason most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition but seldom do the math for our own portfolio   in any model you use your weak link is the expected return and covariance   more sophisticated models do n't usually help produce a more reasonable result for that reason your original strategy 80 20 sounds pretty good to me   not sure why you are not diversifying outside of equities but i suppose you have your reasons

there are some important thing you need to understand about bonds and how they work   a bond does n't need an active market like a stock for example to have value     nonetheless there exist active markets for all of these bonds     the purpose of buying these bonds was not to step in due to the absence of a market   rather the purpose was to deliberately bid up the price of these bonds ahead of the market causing their price to rise and yields interest rates to drop   the fed can hold any and all of these bonds to maturity while receiving contractual payments all the while and never sell a single bond back to the market

let me throw in one more variable to consider company 401 k plans typically have much higher fees than you are likely to get if you shop around on your own as long as you do n't go with a high dollar broker you wo n't see these fees on your statements typically which i think is criminal but they are hidden in the prices of the funds you are buying in the 401k.   if you do n't believe me get the quotes for a fund from the 401 k company 's web site then look up the same fund on a site like the share prices wo n't match and you will be angry until you come to terms with it so if you have a choice of money in a personal retirement account versus a 401 k always go with your own account unless    or

i 'm pretty sure it 's easy to tell in hindsight if they were leaving   just look at the companies who started outsourcing   not just to mexico but the world over     it was roughly a 30 tariff that was a barrier   if i made 100 k a year off of my manufacturing business that is n't so bad   but then i notice that the average mexican in manufacturing today makes slightly over $ 2 an hour on average   i can pay one american $ 8 an hour or i can pay 4 mexicans $ 8 an hour combined   assuming i have the capital tools i can go south quadruple my production cut my labor cost and still come out ahead with this tariff   if 1 person makes 10 widgets sold for $ 10 each an hour i can settle for either 10 widgets with one american for $ 8 or i can have 40 widgets with 4 mexicans for $ 8   by my math 1 hour of american widgets makes me $ 100 minus 8 for the american wage   1 hour of mexican widgets makes me $ 280 minus 2.9 for mexicans wage after tariffs     a 30 tariff is nothing   anyone that thinks that was standing in the way of anyone leaving is foolish   it is true that it may make people second guess up until the point they look at how much more profit they will return   and of course it makes it easier for them when there is no tariff but it is also true you are ultimately better off as a consumer when there are no tariffs

traditionally dealers and broker dealers were in contact with the actual producers of a product or issuers of a security selling it at the exchange on their behalf   consumers would traditionally be on the buy side of course these days anyone can enter the market on either side   even if you do n't hold the security or product you could sell it and take on the risk of having to stock up on it by the delivery date in exchange for cash or other securities   on the other side if you ca n't hold the product or security you could still buy it taking on the risk of having to dispose of it somehow by delivery in exchange for cash or other securities in either case you the sell side take on risk and provide products securities cash   this is most commonly known as market making   modern literature coins the terms liquidity taker buy side and liquidity provider sell side   even more accurately risk management literature would use the terms risk taker sell side and risk or risk buy side this is quite illustrative in modern abstract markets   take a market that allows for no offsetting or hedging because the product in question is abstract or theoretical e.g. weather trading volatility trading inflation trading etc   there 's always one party trying to eliminate dependence on or correlation to the product the risk buy side and the counterparty taking on their risk sell side

is a latin phrase that simply means irregular deposit it 's a concept from ancient roman contract law that has a very narrow scope and does n't actually apply to your example there are two distinct parts to this concept one dealing with the notion of a deposit and the other with the notion of i 'll address them both in turn since they 're both relevant to the tax issue i also think that this is an example of the problem since your proposed solution give my money to a friend for safekeeping is n't the right solution to your actual problem how can i keep my money safe the currency issue is a complication but it does n't change the fact that what you 're proposing probably is n't a good solution the key word in my definition of is contract you do n't mention a legally binding contract between you and your friend an oral contract does n't qualify because in the event of a breach it 's difficult to enforce the agreement legally there is n't any proof of an oral agreement and emotionally taking your friend to court might cost you your friendship i 'm not a lawyer but i would guess that the absence of a contract implies that even though in the eyes of you and your friend you 're giving him the money for safekeeping in the eyes of the law you 're simply giving it to him in the us you would owe gift taxes on these funds if they 're higher than a certain amount in other words this is n't really a deposit it 's not like a security deposit in which the money may be held as collateral in exchange for a service e.g. not trashing your apartment or a financial deposit where the money is held in a regulated financial institution like a bank this is n't a solution to the problem of keeping your money safe because the lack of a contract means you incur additional risk in the form of legal risk that is n't present in the context of actual deposits also if you do n't have an account in the right currency but your friend does how are you planning for him to store the money anyway if you convert your money into his currency you take on exchange rate risk unless you hedge which is another complication if you do n't convert it and simply leave it in his safe house car boot etc you 're still taking on risk because the funds are n't insured in the event of loss   furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend even if you ignore all the risks above without a written contract you have little recourse if a your friend decides to spend the money and not return it b your friend runs into financial trouble and creditors make claim to his assets or c you get into financial trouble and creditors make claims to your assets the idea of giving money to another individual for safekeeping during bankruptcy has been tested in us courts and ruled invalid if you do decide to go ahead with a contract and you do want your money back from your friend eventually you 're in essence loaning him money and this is a different situation with its own complications look at this question and this question before loaning money to a friend although this does apply to your situation it 's mostly irrelevant because the irregular part of the concept of irregular deposit is a standard feature of currencies and other legal tender it 's part of the of modern currencies and does n't have anything to do with taxes if you 're only giving your friend physical currency if you 're giving him property other assets etc for safekeeping it 's a different issue entirely but it 's still probably going to be considered a gift or a loan you 're basically correct about what means but i think you 're overestimating its reach in modern law in roman times it simply refers to a contract in which two parties made an agreement for the depositor to deposit money or goods with the and withdraw equivalent money or goods sometime in the future although this is a feature of the modern deposit banking system it 's one small part alongside contract law deposit insurance etc these other parts add complexity but they also add security and risk mitigation your arrangement with your friend is much simpler but also much riskier   and yes there probably are taxes on what you 're proposing because you 're basically giving or loaning the money to your friend even if you say it 's not a loan or a gift the law may still see it that way the absence of a contract makes this especially important because you do n't have anything speaking in your favor in the event of a legal dispute besides what you meant the money to be furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend and the absence of a contract exacerbates this issue if you want to keep your money safe keep it in an account that 's covered by deposit insurance if you do n't have an account in that currency either a talk to a lawyer who specializes in situation like this and work out a contract or b open an account with that currency as i 've stated i 'm not a lawyer so none of the above should be interpreted as legal advice that being said i 'll reiterate again that the concept of is a concept from ancient roman law trying to apply it within a modern legal system without a contract is a potential recipe for disaster if you need a legal solution to this problem not that you do i think what you 're looking for is a bank talk to a lawyer who understands modern law since ancient roman law is n't applicable to and wo n't pass muster in a modern day court

yes you can insure against the fall in price of stock by purchasing a put option   you pay for a put and if the price of the share falls below the strike price of the put then you can exercise the put   on exercise the person who sold you the put contract agrees to buy the stock for the strike price even though that strike price is higher than the market price   you can adjust the level of insurance by buying put options at higher or lower prices or buying fewer put options than shares you own leaving some shares uninsured alternatively you can minimize your risk exposure by investing in an index or other fund which gives you partial ownership in a large number of shares   that means on any given day lots of shares do worse and lots of shares do better   you can reduce the need for insurance by purchasing a lower risk lower growth financial product

a cash management account from an investment firm like fidelity or schwab will do that you can access funds by check or atm and get a bit of interest the interest rates are very low or you could put it in a money market account and access it by check with a slightly less worse interest rate you can pursue higher returns by investing part of the money but with increasing risk as you seek higher returns options include putting some of the money into a short term bond fund for example

the expense ratio is stated as an annual figure but is often broken down to be taken out periodically of the fund 's assets in traditional mutual funds there will be a percent of assets in cash that can be to cover the expenses of running the fund and most deposits into the fund are done in cash in an exchange traded fund new shares are often created through creation redemption units which are baskets of securities that make things a bit different in the case of an etf the dividends may be reduced by the expense ratio as the trading price follows the index usually expense ratios can vary as in some cases there may be initial waivers on new funds for a time period to allow them to build an asset base there is also something to be said for economies of scale that allow a fund to have its expense ratio go down over time as it builds a larger asset base these would be noted in the prospectus and annual reports of the fund to some degree spdr annual report on page for the russell 3000 etf notes its expense ratio over the past 5 years being the following 0.20 0.20 0.22 0.20 thus there is an example of some fluctuation if you want a real world example

gt that there are more jobs today is n't a convincing argument   you yourself said that automation means there is a net loss in jobs   if that were true there would be less jobs now than in 1900   but the opposite is true   products are more efficiently reaching the consumer   this means more people are buying more things   this means producers have to hire more people or buy more raw materials   lets go with a real classic example   lets say that you and myself make sewing needles   we both do it by hand because in this example we are at the dawn of the industrial revolution making a needle at a time   now lets say i figure out a way to make a machine that makes 100 needles in the time it took me to make 1 and because less of my time is going into each needle i can sell them cheaper   i am now able to reach more stores than before to sell my sewing needles   i have to hire some more people to make deliveries because i can only do so much by myself   now i also grow to the point of having to buy another machine because my business is booming   people love my sewing needles   but i ca n't man 2 machines so i hire in another person   now i have more people making deliveries and i no longer deliver myself because i am better at making needles than delivering them   the guys supplying me with the metal to make the needles also had to hire some people to keep up with my demand   and the people mining the metal for my needles also had to hire another miner   this may sound like a made up story but this sort of thing was going on at this time     the argument that automation kills jobs has been around since before the industrial revolution   how much would your cell phone be if we were still using horse and cart to deliver goods   would your mother sister girlfriend wife yourself if you are a girl be able to have a full time job if they did not have a washing machine iron vacuum cleaner other appliances   what kind of selection in the grocery store would you have if the tractor was never used

can you afford to lose the $ 2200 if not the answer is do n't buy the stock no one can tell you if a stock will continue to go up but the general rule is that the more hype there is on a stock the more likely it is that it 's reached a top and is due for a downward correction soon also note that the more expectation there is for a company the more negatively the market will react if the company 's earnings report comes in even slightly below expectation or if the company hints at a slowdown in the future if that buyback does n't happen you mentioned expect the stock to drop a lot only a really positive surprise news announcement will make it continue to rise on earnings day if you really want to buy this stock my advice would be to learn about chart patterns and other basic technical analysis to have at least some idea of whether the stock is due for a correction soon if you see it grow in a hockey stick shape upward it probably is

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

note that an index fund may not be able to precisely mirror the index it 's tracking if enough many people invest enough money into funds based on that index there may not always be sufficient shares available of every stock included in the index for the fund to both accept additional investment and track the index precisely   this is one of the places where the details of one index fund may differ from another even when they 're following the same index ideally they ought to deliver the same returns but in practical terms they 're going to diverge a bit personally as long as i 'm getting market rate of return or better on average across all my funds at a risk i 'm comfortable with i honestly do n't care enough to try to optimize it further pick a distribution based on some stochastic modelling tools rebalance periodically to maintain that distribution and otherwise ignore it that 's very much to the taste of someone like me who wants the savings to work for him rather than vice versa

there is no one solution to every project finance problem two models might make sense in this situation however in this case you would count all the money that you give to your friend as a loan which he will pay back with interest the interest rate and loan amounts will have to be agreed on by both of you one one hand the interest should be high enough to reward you in a successful outcome for the amount of risk that you take on if things do n't work out on the other the interest rate needs to be low enough where his earnings after loan repayment justify your friend 's effort in addition to being competitive to rate your friend could secure from a bank the downside to this plan is you do n't directly benefit from the franchise 's profits in this model you will record the cash that each of you invests since your friend is also adding sweat equity by setting up and operating the franchise you will need to quantify the work that your friend and you invest into the franchise then you can determine how much each of you has invested in terms of dollars and split any franchise profits based on those proportions the downside of this plan is that it is difficult to estimate how much time each of you invests and how much that time is worth

because this is money se and you 're connecting it to offspring i 'd think about a discussion with them to get their agreements from my perspective anything my wife and i have will go to offspring in the end as such everything borrowed and not repaid simply reduces the estate by that much among multiple offspring such reductions should be against the borrower rather than spreading it out that should be accounted for in whatever will is created this would be the discussion point it might also be discussed how or even if any interest should accrue for unpaid amounts if for example a 1 apr is agreed upon for unpaid loans then the final amount is taken off of the borrower 's inheritance existing outstanding loans might or might not be useful examples for sample calculations if desired or needed if nothing else they might serve as reminders that loans were not forgotten by having such a discussion you can show that you are trying to plan for a fair distribution of your estate perhaps thereby any concern about charging interest to offspring for repaid loans at the same time you 're handing over some financial responsibility giving them a power of personal choice which seems to be a part of what you 're concerned about once such a discussion is started it 's possible that any question of interest will resolve itself naturally the discussion almost necessarily must include all offspring at once one will find it harder to negotiate from a standpoint of pure self interest without objection from another think beforehand about what will be said and about what responses might come think things through as much as you can

your best shot in terms of credit card compatibility would probably be a very large private european bank like deutsche bank or the like a mastercard in england it is quite difficult to get an account without being a resident but i think hsbc offers a so called passport account to non residents with all the usual cards and benefits even overdraft but it 's probably expensive    i think you underestimate how the banking world in europe is there are plenty of different local systems in each country france has it 's custom cb system and germany has a system called and a cashless system called which no one really uses even if you have a mastercard or visa with pin from a european bank there is no guarantee that it 'll work everywhere reliably i remember my german housemate having loads of trouble with his mastercard in england in addition you will most likely be charged for paying with your cc and atm withdrawals in any other country fees can range up to 3 for a transaction so ideally you profile which european country you travel to the most and set up the account there you should also look for between certain european banks i remember barclays and deutsche bank on a side note i 'm still amazed by how backwards some banking systems are e.g. the english i 've been using secure pin tan online banking in germany for over 10 years transfers are quick international transfers are free as long as they are in euro etc everything runs pretty smooth not so in england you need to confirm online transactions over the phone wtf and your only security is a pin and memorable information inter bank transfers if not set up online cost up to 30 pounds even though i could just go to the other bank draw the cash there and pay it in to the account for free international transfers start at 20 quid etc    i could hardly imagine living in a cheque reliant system like the states anymore

renters insurance should also have some level of liability coverage i.e. if you caused a flooding because you went on and broke the pipe or a fire because you smoked in the bed there should be some level of coverage for that however most of the damage the tenant can do is probably not accidental if you broke the pipe you probably did something wrong if you caused fire by smoking in bed you obviously did something wrong while seemingly accidental you 're deeply at fault insurance companies are not in business for rewarding risky behavior accidents where the tenant has nothing to do with what happened earthquakes fires because of say wiring flooding because it too much or bird flying into a window and it are covered by the homeowner 's insurance in any case talk to your insurance agent about your specific policy and concerns

you can be a co borrower on the property that your father owns some banks require that you also be part owner of the property some banks do not require this you can take a home loan for a new property normally banks will ask you of all your current loans auto other home etc to determine the amount they will be ready to lend edit the first loan i believe your father already has a property in his name your father can apply for loan against property if he does not have sufficient income then you can guarantee the loan ie co sign on the loan some banks allow this however there is no tax benefit on this loan      the second is the home loan for the balance amount that you would get it both the loans can be taken from the same bank there would be a overall cap as to the amount of loan a bank would give depending on your income further the finance for this house will only be to the extent of 80 of the value

things are the way they are because they got that way    banks have been in business for a very long time yet much of what we take for granted in terms of technology capabilities capacity and cost are relatively recent developments banks are often stuck on older platforms mainframe for instance where the cost of redundant online storage far exceeds the commodity price consumers take for granted similarly software enhancements that require back end changes can be more complicated moreover unless there 's a buck or billion to be made banks just tend to move slowly compared to the rest of the business world overcoming but we 've always done it that way is an incredible hurdle in a large established organization like a bank and so things do n't generally improve without great effort i 've had friends who 've worked inside technology divisions at big banks tell me as much a smaller bank with less historical technical debt and organizational overhead might be more likely to fix a problem like this but i doubt the biggest banks lose any sleep over it

it has to do with return i do n't know if canada has a matching feature on retirement accounts but in the us many companies will match the first x% you put in so for me my first $ 5000 or so is matched 100 i 'll take that match over paying down any debt beyond that of course it 's a simple matter of rate of return why save in the bank at 2 when you owe at 10 18   one can make this as simple or convoluted as they like my mortgage is a tax deduction so my 5 mortgage costs me 3.6 i 've continued to invest rather than pay the mortgage too early as my retirement account is with pre tax dollars so $ 72 will put $ 100 in that account even in this last decade bad as it was i got more than 3.6 return

you can only deduct with the 2 agi threshold expenses that you 've actually incurred i.e. you actually paid for equipment or services provided and can show receipts for the payment at the request of the employer i.e. you did n't just decide on your own to buy a new book or take a class your employer told you to with business necessity i.e. it was in order for you to do your job and you were not reimbursed by your employer i.e. you went somewhere and spent your after tax money on something employer explicitly told you to pay for and you did n't get reimbursed for that from your story these conditions do n't hold for you as i said in the comments i strongly suggest you talk to a lawyer your story just does n't make any sense and i suspect your employer is doing something very fishy here

what they are doing is wrong the irs and the state might not be happy with what they are doing   one thing you can ask for them to do is to give you a credit card for business and travel expenses you will still have to submit receipts for expenses but it will also make it clear to the irs that these checks are not income keep the pay stubs for the year or the pdf files if they do n't give you a physical stub pay attention to the ytd numbers on each stub to make sure they are n't in the expenses as income if they continue to do this ask about ownership of the items purchased since you will be paying the tax should n't you own it   you can in the future tell them i was going to buy x like the customer wanted but i just bought a new washer at home and their was n't enough room on the credit card maybe next month

1 when it says an investment or mutual fund is a mutual fund not    an investment if no what is the definition of an investment a mutual fund is indeed an investment the article probably mentions   mutual funds separately from other investments because it is not uncommon for mutual funds to give you the option to automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains     2 when it says in terms of stocks why does it only mention    distribution of dividends but not distribution of capital gains since distributions are received as cash deposits they can be used to buy more of the stock capital gains on the other hand occur when an asset increases in value these gains are realized when the asset is sold in the case of stocks reinvestment of capital gains does n't make much sense since buying more stock after selling it to realize capital gains results in you owning as much stock as you had before you realized the gains 3 when it says in terms of mutual funds it says about the    reinvestment of distributions and dividends does distributions not    include distributions of dividends why does it mention    distributions parallel to dividends used in this setting dividend and distribution are synonymous which is highlighted by the way they are used in parallel 4 does reinvestment only apply to interest or dividends but not to    capital gain reinvestment only applies to dividends in the case of stocks mutual funds must distribute capital gains to shareholders making these distributions essentially cash dividends usually as a special end of year distribution if you 've requested automatic reinvestment the fund will buy more shares with these capital gain distributions as well

what other ways would you suggest plus if i truly believe that the product i 'm selling is going to improve your life it would be incredibly fucking rude not to give you the opportunity to obtain it and that is how i feel i 'm not wasting people 's time i am honestly trying to better their lives with my product i do n't really understand how that makes me an intrusive asshole honestly its people like you who are the assholes i 'm making cold calls because that 's my job i believe in my product and believe my potential customers will find it desirable too when people like you assume we are just intrusive assholes trying to rip people off it makes my job harder less efficient and no where near as fulfilling i would suggest you take a look at yourself and change your attitude towards people who approach you with their products instead of assuming everyone who attempts to sell you something is just a rude intrusive waste of time

use the budget to drive down spending so you can save for retirement for college for expenses and so you can pay off your mortgage early   some dave ramsey for example advocate for an envelope system   if your budget says 100 a month for restaurants then at the beginning of the month you put 100 into that envelope   once you 've spent that much on restaurants that month you 're done for the month   on the other hand if you do n't spend the 100 then you have two choices   either you can adjust the budget downward and put the money somewhere else like your mortgage or you can build up cash in that account so you can afford a really expensive restaurant in a few months

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

government registering of financial institutions usually is to make the government safe eg is watching for money laundering and financing terrorism rather than to make it 's customers safe   most governments have many levels of registrations and regulatory bodies the most stringent requirements are usually obligatory only for banks and they indeed often include precautions for insuring customer 's deposits even this insurances have limits eg in most eu countries the state guarantees deposits up to if you deposit more and the bank you lose everything over the limit companies like forex or currency exchanges usually make their best effort to avoid as many regulations as possible just because it 's costly if a given company does have guarantee funds and/or customer insurance it should be advertised and explained on their website however the whole issue of trust is you do n't have to trust in your grocery store to shop there there is no government guarantee that the vegetables sold will be tasty if you buy and the product short of your expectations you call it a loss and start shopping elsewhere financial services are no different than any other product i recommend to your aunt to start small and see how it works if a service turns out well she can increase the amount sent through exchange and decrease amount sent through bank but still it 's always prudent to send eg $ 1000 every week instead of $ 4000 once a month it 's more time consuming and cumbersome than having your bank do it but it 's the safety and convenience you 're paying premium for

littleadv has given you excellent general advice but to my mind the most important part of it all and the path which i will strongly recommend you follow is the suggestion to look into a mutual fund i would add even more strongly   go to a mutual fund company directly     and make an investment with them directly instead of making the     investment through a brokerage account   pick an index fund with low expenses e.g. there are s&p 500 index funds available with   expenses that are a fraction of 1 however many also require minimum investments on the order of $ 2500 or $ 3000 except for ira accounts   at this time your goal should be to reduce expenses as much as possible because expenses whether they be in brokerage fees which may be directly visible to you or mutual fund expenses which are invisible to you are what will eat away at your return far more than the difference between the returns of various investments

ach transfers are reversible and traceable so what 's stopping them is the ease and the speed with which they would be caught when you give a check you have to provide some information to the payee so that they could cash it you ca n't withhold the bank or the account number how would they charge you so it has to be on it and if it is on it it can be put on any other fake check that is why checks come also with your signature and are always available for you to inspect when they 're cashed if you notice something out of the ordinary check you did n't give ach transfer you did n't authorize on your statement it is your responsibility to notify the bank within x period of time 60 days i think of the statement and it will be dealt with so the best way to protect yourself would be to keep an eye on your account and verify that the transactions that you see are all authorized and do it frequently keeping large amounts of cash on your checking account is never a good idea regardless also since checks are inherently unsafe try to only give checks to people you trust and use bill pay or credit cards with anyone else

just to offer another alternative consider certificates of deposit cds at an fdic insured bank or credit union for small or short term investments if you do n't need access to the money as stated and are not willing to take much risk you could put money into a number of cds instead of investing it in stocks or just letting it sit in a regular savings checking account you are essentially lending money to the bank for a guaranteed length of time anywhere from 3 to 60 months and therefore they can give you a better rate of return than a savings account which is basically lending it to them with the condition that you could ask for it all back at any time your rate of return in cds is lower a typical stock investment but carries no risk at all cd rates typically increase with the length of the cd for example my credit union currently offers a 2.3 apy on a 5-year cd but only 0.75 for 12 month cds and a mere 0.1 apy on regular savings checking accounts putting your full $ 10 k deposit into one or more cds would yield $ 230 a year instead of a mere $ 10 in their savings account if you go this route with some or all of your principal note that withdrawing the money from a cd before the end of the deposit term will mean forfeiting the interest earned some banks may let you withdraw just a portion of a cd but typically not work around this by splitting your funds into multiple cds and possibly different term lengths as well to give you more flexibility in accessing the funds personally i have a rolling emergency fund ~6 months living expenses separate from all investments and day to day income expenses split evenly among 5 cds each with a 5-year deposit term for the highest rate with evenly maturity dates in any given year i could close one of these cds to cover an emergency and lose only a few months of interest on just 20 of my emergency fund instead of several years interest on all of it if i needed more funds i could withdraw more of the cds as needed in order of youngest deposit age to minimize the interest loss although that loss would probably be the least of my worries by then if i 'm dipping deeply into these funds i 'll be needing them pretty badly   initially i created the cds with a very small amount and differing term lengths 1 year increments from 1 5 years and then as each matured i rolled it back into a 5 year cd now every year when one matures i add a little more principal to account for increased living expenses and roll everything back in for another 5 years minimal thought and effort no risk much higher return than savings fairly liquid accessible in an emergency and great peace of mind plus it ensures i do n't blow the money on something else and that i have something to fall back on if all my other investments completely tanked or i had massive medical bills or lost my job etc

this was a really unusual deal because a fund owned by one of the owners of the company was buying much of the shares seems that maybe someone at the company realized that they could get an ipo for much less than 7 because the bank was n't really doing much work or taking much risk for their cut and that nobody figured to put contingencies for this in a contract because how often does it happen   edit do people even read the articles for these things   you do an ipo where an existing shareholder and company director is buying half the deal that 's not quite the same as doing an ipo where the banks are just selling shares to investors that the banks dig up and when that shareholder decides that he 'd rather not buy his escape is not so much refusing to pay for his shares as it is trying to get the deal pulled   if sues the banks they can turn around and sue saying that this is a backdoor way of getting out of their contract

will pull your credit report and perform a hard inquiry on your file this means the inquiry will be noted in your credit report and count against you slightly this is perfectly normal just do n't apply too many times too soon or it can begin to add up they will want proof of your income by asking for recent pay stubs with this information your income and your credit profile they will determine the maximum amount of credit they will lend you and at what interest rate the better your credit profile the more money they can lend and the lower the rate   you want financed the price of the car minus your down payment that is the amount you can apply for and in that case the only factors they will determine are 1 whether or not you will be approved and 2 at what interest rate you will be approved while interest rates generally follow the direction of the prime rate as dictated by the federal reserve there are market fluctuations and variances from one lending institution to the next further different institutions will have different criteria in terms of the amount of credit they deem you worthy of   know the price of the car now determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union or work directly with the dealer dealers often give special deals if you finance through them a common scenario is 1 a person goes to the car dealer 2 test drives 3 negotiates the purchase price 4 the salesman works the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank pay attention during that last process this is also where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate by offering longer loan terms to maximize their returns on your loan it 's not necessarily a bad thing it 's just how they have to make their money in the deal it 's good to know so you can form your own analysis of the deal and make sure they do n't completely bankrupt you   that you can comfortable afford your monthly payment the car dealers do n't really know how much you can afford they will try to determine to the best they can but only you really know do n't take more than you can afford be conservative about it for example think you can only afford $ 300 a month budget it even lower and make yourself only afford $ 225 a month

it depends on how the program is run if the company runs the program out of treasury stock shares that are authorized but not issued then there are n't any shares being purchased on the open market    because of that the share price would n't be affected     if you look in your employer 's annual report you will probably find how the program is run and how many shares are issued annually under that program by comparing that to the daily trading volume of the company 's stock you can gauge whether there 's any likelihood of the share price being affected by the employee purchases that is of course if shares are being purchased on the open market   for example here is books a million 's program as described in their 2011 annual report employee stock purchase plan    the company maintains an employee stock purchase plan under which shares of the company ’s common stock are reserved    for purchase by employees at 85 of the fair market value of the common stock at the lower of the market value for the    company ’s stock as of the beginning of the fiscal year or the end of the fiscal year on may 20 2010 the stockholders of the    company approved an additional 200,000 shares available for issuance under the plan bringing the aggregate number of    shares that may be awarded to 600,000 of the total reserved shares and shares have been    purchased as of january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively this describes an instance of the employee purchase program being run from stock not open market purchases from it we can tell shares were issued during the past fiscal year   as their average daily volume is shares if the program were run from a single open market purchase it would have potential to move the market   one would think though that a company running it from open market purchases would spread the purchases over a period of time to avoid running up the price on themselves

the optimal down payment is 100 the only way you would do anything else when you have the cash to buy it outright is to invest the remaining money to get a better return   when you compare investments you need to take risk into account as well   when you make loan payments you are getting a risk free return   you ca n't find a risk free investment that pays as much as your car loan will be   if you think you can game the system by taking a 0 loan then you will end up paying more for the car since the financing is baked into the sales price in those cases there is no such thing as free money   if you pay cash you have much more bargaining power    buy the car outright negotiating as hard as you can start saving what you would have been making as a car payment as an emergency fund and you 'll be ahead of the game for the inflation hedge you need to find investments that act as an inflation hedge taking a loan does not hedge against inflation since you 'll still be paying interest regardless of the inflation rate   the fact that you 'll be paying slightly less interest in real terms does not make it a hedge to answer the actual question if your reinvestment rate the return you can get from investing the borrowed cash is less than the interest rate then the more you put down the greater your present value pv if your reinvestment rate is less than the interest rate then the less you put down the better not including risk   when you incorporate risk though the additional return is probably not worth the risk so there is no optimal down payment in between those mathematically it will depend on how much liquid cash you need knowing that every dollar that you borrow is costing you interest

answers 1 is this a good idea is it really risky what are the pros and cons yes it is a bad idea i think with all the talk about employer matches and tax rates at retirement vs. now that you miss the forest for the trees it 's the taxes on those retirement investments over the course of 40 years that really matter example imagine $ 833 per month $ 10k per year invested in xyz fund for 40 years when you retire the fund happens to make 10 per year over that time and you 're taxed at 28 how much would you have at retirement 2 is it a bad idea to hold both long term savings and retirement in      the same investment vehicle especially one pegged to the us stock      market yes keep your retirement separate and untouchable it 's supposed to be there for when you 're old and unable to work co mingling it with other funds will induce you to spend it i really need it for that house i can always pay more into it later it also can create a false sense of security look at how much i 've got i got that new car covered so send 10 into whatever retirement account you 've got and forget about it save for other goals separately   3 is buying spy a set it and forget it sort of deal or would i need      to rebalance selling some of spy and reinvesting in a safer vehicle      like bonds over time for a retirement account yes you would that 's the advantage of target date retirement funds like the one in your 401k they handle that and you do n't have to worry about it think about it do you know how to age your account and what to age it into and by how much every year no offense but your next question is what an etf is 4 i do n't know anything about etfs things to consider know read start here 5 my company plan is retirement goal focused which according to      fidelity means that the asset allocation becomes more conservative      over time and switches to an income fund after the retirement      target date 2050 would i need to rebalance over time if holding      spy answered in 3 6 i 'm pretty sure that contributing pretax to 401k is a good idea      because i wo n't be in the 28 tax bracket when i retire how are the      benefits of investing in spy outweigh paying taxes up front or do      they not partially answered in 1 note that it 's that 4 decades of tax free growth that 's the big dog for winning your retirement company matches if you get one are just a bonus and the fact that contributions are tax free is a cherry on top 7 please comment on anything else you think i am missing i think what you 're missing is that winning at personal finance is easy and winning at personal finance is hard

i suggest rolling it over to the 401(k with your new employer   particularly if they match any percentage of your contribution it would be in your interest to take as much of that money as possible when it comes to borrowing money from your 401(k it looks like the issues mentioned only apply if you do n't pay back the money   the reasonable argument against taking money out of your 401(k to buy a home is that it leaves a dent in your retirement nest egg and its earning power during key earning years   on the plus side for borrowing from your 401(k it 's very low interest and it 's interest you 're paying back to yourself over a 5-year period   at its current value the most you could borrow from your 401(k is $   if you 're fortunate in where you live that could be most or all of the downpayment in my own experience my wife borrowed against her 401(k balance for the earnest money when we purchased a new home   fortunately for us an investor snapped up my previous home within 4 days of us listing it so she was able to pay back her loan in full right away

you question is very hard to answer as it is tough to put a value on how much bad your added investment in evil companies would cause and also how much value the charities add   however there has been a bunch of really good work on socially responsible investing in general   this paper might be too technical for some but the conclusion section is very readable and clear the big worry about socially responsible investing from a financial standpoint is that it will lower returns in the long run   the paper above and others show fairly clearly that as long as you only exclude a few classes of stocks and still have a fairly broad base that the expected returns are similar   the main issue though is some socially responsible funds have much higher fees so the usual advice applies do your research to make sure your investments are well diversified and have low fees    as long as the index is fairly broad you can consider the difference between the fees on the socially responsible index and investing in a more common index as the long run cost   then you can balance that cost and having more money for charity against the benefits of not investing in evil companies

inflation is good for the economy primarily because it is an incentive to invest   if inflation is occurring then keeping your holdings in cash is a net loser 5 inflation means that in a year your $ 100 is now worth $ so unless you 're getting really good interest that 's a bad thing   on the other hand if you invested that $ 100 in a business you can inflation more easily since inflation should drive the business 's profits deflation negative inflation on the other hand is bad for investing because it encourages holding cash   if deflation of 5 occurs then you can get a 5 roi by simply holding onto twenty dollar bills why would you invest in a business that was in a deflationary economy and thus would likely earn less money mild inflation also increases flexibility in the economy because businesses make a little more money in terms of denominated money that allows them more flexibility in expansion   salaries for some also go up meaning that spending goes up and often with more flexibility in how those salaries are spent inflation does n't hit all sectors exactly the same so often this leaves significant portions of the middle class with more money to spend and thus driving economic growth more than salary growth though inflation seems to drive job creation   from the new york times this article quotes a paper by george which shows that job creation tends to be more significant than rising salaries during periods of low inflation ie what we 're talking about here   salary increases will come here largely from job seeking rather than raises because businesses do n't tend to cut wages and thus are to significantly raise salaries they 'd rather just hire more people and then cut jobs when the economy weakens or inflation drops   this is even more true in low wage jobs such as minimum wage positions where wages can not be cut but salary increases have little real effect on job retention it 's easier to change the number of hours for pt employees or the number of pt ft employees deflation on the other hand leads to decreased flexibility layoffs and lower consumer spending   while it sounds good to say hey prices are going down to your average consumer you have to keep in mind that those prices are what keep the businesses going that drive our economy and pay your salary either directly or indirectly   if your employer started making 5 less per year do you think they 'd keep you employed   maybe not and at the bottom service industries fast food restaurants grocers etc there would be significant cutbacks if deflation hit them i would note that 5 inflation is probably a bit high most economists like 2 to 3 and the federal reserve has said that 2 is the right target   they 're mostly concerned with avoiding deflation as that 's a big risk to the economy the advantages of mild inflation are relatively minor compared to the damages of deflation and tend to be more correlations you get mild inflation in a good economy as much or more than you need mild inflation for a good economy most important probably is consistent inflation   consumers and businesses can act rationally if the inflation rate is relatively stable and predictable   when inflation jumps or drops it changes the potential outcomes for choices made by investors consumers and businesses meaning choices they made in the past are now suboptimal if the inflation rate is jumping around 1 one year 4 another -1 the next investors businesses and consumers will be relatively conservative in their choices which leads to a bad economy

is right you should put an hourly dollar value on your time   calculate a realistic number and keep it in the back of your mind then when you 're looking for a discount or a saving estimate the maximum amount that you 'd be able to save   this should be a realistic proportion of the value of the item   from those figures you can get the maximum amount of time that you should spend on looking for that discount spend any more than that amount of time and you lose money even if you get the discount   so then you can end up with a few rules of thumb like do n't spend more than x minutes of time per dollar of possible savings   then you can spend the spare time you 've created on looking for savings on big ticket items where the time is more efficiently used or on studying to upgrade your earning potential or on taking some time out to enjoy the world and sniff the flowers

a great deal of analysis on this question relies on misunderstandings of the market or noticing trends that happened at the same time but were not caused by each other   without knowing your view i 'll just give the basic idea the amount of active management is self correcting   the reason people have moved out of actively managed funds is that the funds have not been performing well   their objective is to beat their benchmarks by profiting as they correct mispricing   they are performing poorly because there is too much money chasing too few   that is why the actively managed industry is shrinking   if it gets small enough presumably those opportunities will become more abundant and mispricing correction will become more profitable   then money will flow back into active funds relevant active management may not be what a lay person is thinking of   at the retail level we are observing a shift to passive funds but there is still plenty of money in other places   for example pension and endowment funds normally have an objective of beating a market benchmark like the russell 3000   as a result they are constantly trying to find opportunities to invest in active management that really can outperform   they represent a great deal of money and are nothing like the buy and forget stereotype we sometimes imagine   moreover hedge funds and trading shops explicitly and solely try to correct   they represent a very very large bucket of money that is not shrinking   active retail mutual funds and individual investors are not as relevant for pricing as we might think   more trading volume is not necessarily a good thing nor is it the measure of market quality   one argument against passive funds is that passive funds do n't trade much   yet the volume of trading in the markets has risen dramatically over time as a result of technological improvements algorithmic traders mostly   they have out competed certain market makers who used to make money on inefficiencies of the market   is this a good thing or a bad thing   well prices are more efficient now and it appears that these computers are more responsive to price relevant information than people used to be   so even if trading volume does decrease i see no reason to worry that prices will become less efficient   that 's not the direction things have gone even as passive investing has boomed overall worries about passive investing rely on an assumption that there is not enough interest in and resources for making arbitrage profits to keep prices efficient   this is highly counterfactual and always will be   as long as people and institutions want money and have access to the markets there will be plenty of resources allocated to price correction

in the usa there are two ways this situation can be treated first if your short position was held less than 45 days you have to when preparing the taxes add the amount of dividend back to the purchase price of the stock that 's called adjusting the basis example short at $ 10 covered at $ 8 but during this time stock paid a $ 1 dividend it is beneficial for you to add that $ 1 back to $ 8 so your stock purchase basis is $ 9 and your profit is also $ 1 inside software depending what you use there are options to click on adjust the basis or if not than do it manually specifically for those shares and add a note for tax second option is to have that payment in lieu paid deducted as investment but that option is only available if you hold the shorts for more than 45 days and itemize your deductions hope that helps

gt why should we trust big to release accurate information that may be to their business   enforcement via inspection you only need to check up on a small portion of claims to ensure accuracy have hefty fines for inaccurate information and jail time for anyone who intentionally   gt;the problem is that the usda has been underfunded to the point that it 's completely incapable of doing the amount of inspections needed    there 's a simple and obvious solution to that   do n't know what they need to be educated about and rely on reporters and experts to make recommendations and revelations on their behalf    that 's why there 's a mix of sources indeed consumers do n't know but they still have the right to ask silly questions actual knowledgeable people are also involved so that actual meaningful questions be answered   all laws that restrict the first amendment when it comes to our food disparaging a food product should not be illegal in a free country public health should be more important than sales of products   those laws are in part there to protect public safety causing an unfounded panic over food products could be disastrous public health is the justification for those laws existing not protecting sales

the answer to this question will vary considerably by state and how utilities are regulated in your area in new york energy supply companies are almost always a ripoff for consumers versus the old style regulated utility in ny the utility supply markups are tightly regulated but are less regulated   you also need to really understand the marketplace rules for locking in a price if you can lock in the july price for natural gas for a year that rocks there are other factors as well but even then its a real bet since weather and supply factors can have a dramatic effect on gas prices in the winter imo the best bet is to run with the market rates and bank the efficiency improvements that you build into your home over time some utilities offer budget plans that smooth out your payments without interest i 'd recommend that route if predictable bills are your goal

the best advice i can give you is that you need to start on math now*. i made the same mistake as op and did n't realize that going up in finance would require as much math as it does granted i was undergrad finance not marketing like him so maybe it was a little better for me but if you really want to do upper level finance do not on math   it 's easy to fall into the trap doing cal 2 your sophomore year and thinking i wo n't really need this and just doing the minimum to get through it for undergrad that 's true for master 's you 'll need it this happened to me and i suffered a lot because of it your professors in the master 's program will likely give you a crash course in what you need to know but you wo n't have a real understanding of it unless you took and did really well in those math classes beforehand   to answer your question    1 maybe you should definitely take cal 1 early depending on how you can hold on to the information cal 2 can wait a bit so it 's fresher when you start doing upper level finance your second half of junior year senior year   2 upper level finance is a whole different beast from lower level finance same with economics if you 're not good at math if you do n't enjoy math it might not be the best choice i 'm not good at math and the undergrad finance was n't too bad however the master 's program was very very not fun    edit ymmv but i do n't recommend going straight into the master 's program straight out of undergrad work in industry for a bit first the jobs you need to a master 's for wo n't hire you straight out of undergrad so it 'll be dead weight experience is what you need

i have n't looked at that warranty in detail but generally speaking this should help what is gap insurance in the case of a total loss write off gap insurance covers the outstanding finance after your regular insurance pay out the two wo n't match up usually because of the depreciation right after you buy the car for example if you take out $ 20,000 finance and buy a car then write it off after six months your insurance company may only value it at $ 16,000 but it 's unlikely you will have cleared $ 4,000 from your finance gap insurance will pay out the difference and settle the debt will chrysler change the engine if it comes to yes unless they identify misuse or deliberate damage for instance if you do 1000 miles and the engine explodes it 's a mechanical fault that the warranty would cover if they open up the engine look at and find it 's been to within an inch of it 's life they may claim it was your driving which has destroyed the engine and you would have to prove it was an underlying fault and would have blown either way will car dents be covered with this bumper to bumper insurance not likely as i mentioned in the last point if it 's your fault it would n't be covered i think you may be confusing the terms insurance and warranty at this point insurance would cover your dents but a warranty only covers the manufacturer 's faults even in the case of extended warranties what does basic mean in terms of warranty sounds obvious but whatever chrysler want it to mean there 's no legal definition of basic so you would need to check the documents thoroughly or ask them to explain exactly what is and is n't covered if they 're reluctant it 's probably because basic covers very little

i 'm just began playing in the stock    market i assume you mean that you 're not using real money but rather you have an account with a stock simulator like the one investopedia offers i am hopeful that 's the case due to the high level of risk involved in short selling like you 're describing here is another post about short selling that expands a bit on that point to learn much more about the ins and outs of short selling i will point again to investopedia i swear i do n't work for them but they do have a great short selling tutorial   when you short sell a stock you are borrowing the stock from your broker the broker typically uses stock held by one or more of his clients to cover the loan since it 's basically a loan you pay interest of course the longer you hold it the more interest you pay also as joe mentioned there are scenarios in which you may be forced to buy the stock at a higher price than you sold it this tends to happen when the stock price is going against the short sell i.e. you lose money finally did anyone mention that the potential losses in a short sell are infinite

i do n't understand the calculations in the comments by the op he says my monthly savings after mandatory expense is around usd 2000 this includes rent expenses emergency fund savings and the monthly required payment of my auto loan   emphasis added he has $ 2000 usd left over after monthly expenses which includes rent food utilities etc contribution towards emergency funds and the required monthly payment on the auto loan he claims that by applying the $ 2000 usd per month towards reducing the debt it would take him 30 36 months to be debt free   but is it not the case that applying the $ 2000 to the student loan of $ while continuing to make the auto loan payments will pay the student loan off in less than 10 months if no payments are made on that $ student loan the accrued interest of about $ 2 k in 10 months this is for a total of $ in actuality with the loan being paid down the interest will be much less once the student loan is paid off the extra $ 2000 can go towards what is left of the $ 10 k auto loan each month and   pay it off in another 4 or 5 months or so so we are talking of 15 months max instead of 30 36 months of course as carlos points out the car is more valuable as an asset than can be sold in case of job loss   creating   a need for cash etc and so paying it off first might be better but that is a different calculation

it seems that you think you are freelancing and they think you are an employee what 's bad for you the tax office will also think you are an employee if they withhold tax for you alternatively they think you are stupid and they keep the money but are actually not paying it to the tax office at all in which case you will have a bad surprise when you do your tax returns   first i 'd ask them for proof that they are indeed paying these taxes into some account related to you i 'd then ask a tax adviser for some serious advice if they are acting out of incompetence and not out of malice then you should be mostly fine but your work there will count as employment   heaven knows why they treat you as an employee check your contract with them whether it is between you and them or your company and them it maybe that they never hired a contractor and believe that they have to pay employment tax they do n't if your company sends them a bill then they need to pay that bill 100 of it and that 's it taxes are fully your business and your responsibility as quid said if they say they are withholding tax then at the very least there must be a paystub that proves they have actually been paying these taxes if they withhold taxes and there is no paystub then this looks like a criminal attempt to cheat you   if they have actually paid taxes properly into your account then they are merely creating a mess that can hopefully be fixed but it is probably complicated enough that you need a tax advisor even if you had none before since instead of paying to your company they paid some money to the company and some to you personally

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

i have a few recommendations comments the trick here is to make it clear to the dealer that you will not be getting a new car from them and their only hope of making some money is to sell you your own car you need to be prepared to walk away and follow through don't buy a new car from them even if you end up turning it in they could still come back a day later and offer a deal leasing a new car every 3 years is not the best use of money you have to really really like that new car feeling every three years and be willing to pay a premium for it if you 're a car nut like me and want to spend money on a luxury car it 's far wiser to purchase a slightly used luxury vehicle keep it for 8 + years and that way you wo n't have a car payment half the time

these cars are generally considered out of date and are less prone to be victims of car theft while being reasonably safe make sure you pick a model with a good reliability reputation see what comes up at your local junk yard the common old models have survived long enough to not end up there until now servicing your car takes some effort and some initial investments but learning how to fix simple problems by yourself will save you a lot of money in the long run start by learning how to locate some simple faults diagnosing issues is a very costly process if done professionally but some you may be able to find by yourself all cars sold in usa from 1996 are required to have this connection below the steering rack as a consequence most cars manufactured 1995 will have this connector world wide if you connect your to this port your car will be able to tell you what 's wrong through an app on your phone and you will be able to clear fault codes by yourself to make sure the problem really is solved this is what you mechanic should use when servicing your car while a new print can be expensive you can find used manuals getting thrown out of service centers or at yard sales these will include service notes and sometimes had written notes to help you out the majority of parts on cars are still in working condition and may not ever see significant wear and tear if you put some time into removing the part yourself you will have a good idea of how difficult it is to replace the part on your car and outsource the work to a professional if needed this of course assumes you bring good parts the main income should come from the work performed on your car not the markup of spare parts generally speaking specialized mechanics working with one or few brands of cars are preferable as these will not only be familiar with your car but are also more likely to get original spare parts not pirate parts made to be compatible at a cheaper price this will make sure the part works as intended and not cause wear and tear of other parts for example you 'd much rather replace a broken instead of cleaning up the aftermath of fried electronics turn off the ac when it 's not needed there should be a button labeled econ or similar which will disable the ac compressor while keeping the rest of the systems running the compressor is usually driven by a belt from the and will eat up some of the power your engine produces just remember that while it saves gas uncomfortable driving conditions may shorten your patience and reduces your attention accelerate up to speed quickly contrary to popular belief this saves more gas than accelerating slowly because the time your engine is under increased load is shorter combined with higher efficiency at medium engine speeds allow your speed to decline on you will regain that speed once the road levels out unless you 're in heavy traffic driving a bit slower should n't harm the flow do n't let go of the gas pedal just avoid compensating as much your target should be to not lose more than 20 of your speed over the entire and have a constant or you will start interfering with traffic make sure your car is healthy as obvious as it may sound worn out parts may harm your mileage increased friction in due to broken protective covers or reduced pressure from a broken exhaust are just examples if things that will ruin the efficiency of you by themselves they may not do much but they add up into both gas consumption and reliability issues really do read your owners manual nobody knows your car better than the people who built it what 's best for my car may not be best for your car and the best way to make sure your car is working as intended is to take an afternoon with your manual and a cup of your favorite beverage afterwards you will know how all the features of your car works take care of your car and it takes care of you is the principle i 'm working with a car you 're happy with will make you more calm behind the wheel and leads to higher quality of your driving decisions both you and your fellow commuters will benefit from this even if they may never take the time to thank you

what does this mean and how do you do it consider that there are may be more than a few different objectives when it comes to investing each of these is a different objective that can have different timelines objectives for the money as well as possible accounts and investment choices in a sense the question could be stated as how much money do you need and when do you need it is it trying to figure out how much money you hope to have for    retirement or does it include short term expenses the objective could be retirement but does n't have to be the short term expenses can be included in various ways the retirement funds could include what kind of method would be used to make sure expenses can be met as if one is looking at retirement just a few years away the short term expenses may come up as part of the retirement living

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

presumably you need a car to get to work so let 's start with the assumption that you need to buy something to replace the car you just lost the biggest difficulty to overcome in buying a car is the concept of the monthly payment dealers will play games with all of the numbers to massage a monthly payment that the buyer can swallow but this usually does n't end up giving the customer the best deal the 18 month term is not normal for a lease typically you 'll see 24 or 36 months you are focusing on another goal of paying your student loans by then which would free up much more money for other wants like a car but at what cost the big difficulty of personal finance is the mental mind game of delaying gratification for greater long term benefit you are focusing on paying your student loans now so that you can be free of that debt and have more flexibility for the future good you 're tempted to spend another $ 5400 assuming no down payment or other surprise fees to drive a car for 18 months that does n't sound any wiser than $ 5,000 for an unreliable used car that gave you more problems than you for presumably you got some percentage of that money back from the insurance company when the car was totaled but even if not the real lesson should be finding a car that you can afford up front but also one that you can still use when the loan is paid off like your education that investment will keep giving even when the loans are a distant memory my advice would be to look for a car that has about 30k miles on it and pay for it as quickly as possible then drive it at least for 70 120k more miles before replacing it you may wish for a newer car especially in 3 or 4 more years when it starts to show its age but you 'll also thank yourself when you can buy a newer better car with cash and break out of the monthly payment game that dealers try to push on you you might even enjoy negotiating with car salesmen when you see through their manipulations and simply work for the best cash price you can get

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

it 's great that you have gotten the itch to learn about the stock market   there are a couple of fundamentals to understand first though company a has strong growing net earnings and minimal debt it 's trading for $ 100 per share   company b has good revenue but high costs of goods and total liabilities well in excess of total assets it 's trading for $ 0.10 per share   there is no benefit to getting 10,000 shares or 10 shares for your $ 1,000   your goal is to invest in companies that have valuable products and services run by competent management teams   sure the number of shares you own will dictate what percentage of the company you own and in a number of cases your voting power   but even a penny stock will have a market capitalization of several million dollars so voting power is n't really a concern for your $ 1,000 investment    there is a lot more in the three basic financial statements income statement balance sheet statement of cash flows than revenue   seasoned accountants can have a hard time parsing out where money is coming from and where it 's going in general there are obvious red flags like a fast declining cash balance against a fast growing liabilities balance or expenses exceeding revenue   while some of these things are common among new and high growth companies it 's not the place for a new investor with a small bankroll a micro cap company penny stocks are in this group will receive rounds of financing via issuing preferred convertible shares which may include options on more shares   for a company worth $ 20 mm a $ 5 mm financing round can materially change the finances of a company and will likely dilute your holdings in common stock   small growth companies need new financing frequently to fund their growth strategies revenue went up great why   did you open another store   did you open another sales office   did the revenue increase this quarter based on substantially the same operation that existed last quarter or have you increased the capacity of your operation   if you increased the capacity of your operation what was the cost of the increase and did revenue increase as expected   can you expect revenue to continue to grow at this rate or was it a one time windfall from an unusual order sure there are spectacular gains to be had in penny stocks   xyz pharma research or whatever goes from $ 0.05 to $ and you 've turned your $ 1,000 in to $ 12,000   this is a really unlikely event   buying penny stocks is akin to buying lottery tickets   unless you are a high ranking employee at the company capable of making decisions or one of the investors buying the preferred shares mentioned in point 3 or are one of the insiders of a pump and dump scam on the stock penny common stocks are not a place to invest   one could argue that even a company insider should probably avoid buying common stock just to illustrate the points above you mention doing some really heavy research into this stock has made me question the whole penny stock market based on your research what is the enterprise value of the company what were the gross proceeds of the last financing round how many shares were issued and were there any warrants attached what do you perceive to be heavy research   what background do you have in finance accounting to give weight to your ability to perform such research crawl walk then run do n't kid yourself in to thinking that since you have some level of education you understand the contracts involved in enterprise finance

do you have other things you might want to spend that cash on in the near future like a down payment on a house beyond having emergency cash the only reason to keep a pile of cash around is because you might need it for another purchase unless you are going to have other expenses that will require higher interest loans to cover them there 's no need to sit on a big pile of cash as long as you are getting the full match on your 401(k that 's the free money that might be worth more than the interest you are paying on the loans in any case i suggest you aim for at least 10 into your 401(k account moving forward in your life so that you can properly fund retirement 15 would be even better it does n't sound like you would be losing anything by paying the student loans and you could then use the money freed from your loan payments to pay down your car faster

perhaps this is lasting result of the recession   i realize that the article specifically states that lego notably grew and profited through the recession however other parts of society and other markets did n't now years later perhaps those other scenarios are affecting lego 's market   specifically i 'm drawing a parallel to my personal experience my kids were born just before the recession their grade is the largest grade in the school system every grade behind them the kids born during the recession is significantly smaller whatever the was people were having fewer kids during the recession    further although the general view is that the recession is over and the stock markets are back household spending and income continues to stagnate   with fewer kids and a reluctance to spend perhaps people in the us and europe just are n't buying as many premium toys

thanks for the post these are good insights   i 've found most of my personal success looking for work by way of the technical recruiter industry they know a bit more than an hr bot either mechanical or human haha about the reality of technical requirements for a job and are able to find you if you just know where to place yourself   getting solicited for a job by way of your linkedin profile is a much easier way of finding work than the futile carpet bombing of large corporate hr machines no doubt

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

s corp are taxed very different unlike llc where you just add the profit to your income with s corp you have to pay yourself a reasonable salary on w-2 which of course is a lot more paperwork i think the advantage but do n't hold me accountable for this is if your s corp makes a lot more than a reasonable salary then the rest of the money can be passed through on your personal return at a lower corp rate

to answer your question point by point i 'd focus on the last point the back of my business card   let 's focus on single the standard deduction and exemption add to over $ 10k. i look at this as i can have $ 250 k in my ira and my $ 10 k 4 annual withdrawal will be tax free it takes another $ to fill the 10 and 15 brackets $ k saved pretax to have that withdrawn each year or $ m total   that said i think that depositing to roth in any year that one is in the 15 bracket or lower can make sense i also like the roth roulette concept if only for the fact that i am google 's first search result for that phrase   roth roulette is systematically converting and each year the portion of the converted assets that have fallen or not risen as far in relative terms a quick example you own 3 volatile stocks and convert them to 3 roth accounts a year later they are a down 20 b up 10 c up 50 you recharacterize the first two but keep the 3rd in the roth you have a tax bill on say $ 10 k but have $ 15 k in that roth

it 's simply supply and demand    first demand if you 're an importer trying to buy from overseas you 'll need foreign currency maybe euros   or if you want to make a trip to europe you 'll need to buy euros   or if you 're a speculator and think the usd will fall   in value you 'll probably buy euros unless there 's someone willing to sell you euros for dollars you ca n't get any   there are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world   if more want to buy usd than that demand will positively influence the price of the usd as measured in euros   if more people want to buy euros well vice versa there are so many of these transactions globally and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously that the prices exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it   if people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars i.e. if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks by exchanging their dollars for stock then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher   when the stock market crashes you 'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars this represents a lot of demand for dollars then there 's supply it may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there or that supply only changes when bernanke prints money but there 's actually a lot more to it than that   if you 're coming from europe and want to buy some usd from the bank well how much usd does the bank have and what does it mean for them to have money   the bank gets money from depositors or from lenders   if one person puts money in a deposit account and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage the same dollar is being used by two people   the home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account and the same dollar might get lent out again   in economics this is called the multiplier effect the full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re lending    since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions the number of transactions being conducted sometimes on credit affects the supply of money demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash   if i fear the stock market i might keep all my money in dollars   this takes cash away from companies who could invest it takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions and leaves it waiting under my mattress   you could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions the full picture can be a bit more complicated if you look at every way currencies are used globally with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures but this gives the basic story of where prices come from that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces    the bank just facilitates transactions   if the last price exchange rate is 1.2 dollars per euro and the bank gets more requests to buy usd for euros than euros for usd it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even   if the usd gets more expensive at some point fewer people will want to buy it or want to buy products from the us that cost usd   the bank maintains a spread like buy for 1.19 and sell for so it can take a profit you should think of currency like any other commodity and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter   the value of currency is merely a convention but it works   the currency is needed in transactions so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods services and other currencies   as supply and demand for this and other commodities goods services fluctuate so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions a official basket of goods and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes inflation etc   the official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis

as cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets there has n't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation but in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 i 'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that though it would n't surprise me if treatments changed over time in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general treatment for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency your specific questions about what constitutes a business and when you 're considered to be selling the are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the irs as the amounts involved here are so small relatively speaking my recommendation would be to read through what the irs has published carefully make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you 're doing and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations and when in doubt on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them of course i 'm not a lawyer or tax advisor i 'm a stranger on the internet so for real advice you should contact somebody qualified i doubt you 'd be too much for not doing so given the amounts involved you could also attempt contacting a local irs office or calling them with your specific questions and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later there are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of notice 2014 21 you could try calling them as well

the benefit is not in taxes when you sell a portion of your stock you no longer have a portion of your stock when you get a dividend you still have a portion of your stock dividends are distributed from the net profits of a company and as such usually do n't affect its growth earning potential much although there may be cases when they do so while the price takes a temporary dip due to the distribution you 're likely to get the same dividends again next year if the company continues being similarly profitable if you sell a portion of your stock at some point you 'll end up with no more stocks to sell

i think you may have a significant misunderstanding here   you have been renting your property out for two years now   there is no special roommate clause in the tax code roommates are renters and the rent they pay is rental income   if they were roommates in a property you both rented from a third party that would be different see publication chapter 4 for more details on the subject search on renting part of property   you should be you may also consider not renting for profit section which may be closer to what you 're actually thinking of changing from renting not for profit to renting for profit   not rented for profit means you can report on your 1040 as opposed to filing schedule e but it does mean you have to actually not make a profit and remember some of the money that goes to paying the mortgage is not deductible on this side of things since it 's your property and you 'll get that money back presumably when you sell it if that is what you 're asking about it sounds like it 's just a matter of money   are you going to start making money   or are you going to start making enough significant upgrades etc to justify the tax deduction   you should consider the actual specific numbers carefully probably with the help of a cpa who is familiar with this sort of situation and then make the decision that gives you the best outcome keeping in mind that there may be long term impacts of switching from not for profit to for profit rental treatment

in short if you ca n't get the job without incorporating then incorporate some clients will require you to be incorporated which is why i did it 10 years ago   essentially for them it 's a way of themselves from you to ensure they are not responsible for any monies if you do n't pay your taxes   for you there is also this idea of company assets from your personal assets   if they are not requiring you to incorporate you can simply act as a sole proprietorship   a good place to start reading up could be the sites below for canada ontario canada business when i registered i simply bought a book at with all the required forms for ontario   these forms would also be available at a local government service centre you walk in give the government money and shortly thereafter you are incorporated there are a number of others things that are required having a minutes book writing resolutions creating shares setting up a bank account etc all discussed in the guide for ontario you can start here at a high level there are some costs for being incorporated and some tax savings   at a minimum costs would include you may need the help of an account to help set things up but it 's quite easy to maintain all the records etc that are required    some other minor things i enjoy are writing myself expense cheques so that i get money back immediately and effectively only pay 60 of the cost after writing it off in the company i can decide how much to pay myself and push income from year to year

this question is largely opinion based but i wanted to balance out the people jumping on you there are lots of factors that go into salary pay such as what you contribute to the company and you go above or beyond what s expected of you i would say seniority is one factor or at least there is a case to be made that it is important if someone has worked 5 years for me that is five years that i have not had to search interview and train a replacement i am not a business owner but i do employ people and when someone quits its an extremely stressful process not having to go through that again in my opinion is worth a small bump in pay i ca nt comment on if its fair or not that is opinion what is fact is that whenever a broad group of people are given a pay raise for arbitrary reasons and other employees are nt its creates it hurts morale employees leave and in severe cases the business becomes crippled so i m not sure if its fair but is it a bad idea generally see here and i highly recommend going here for anyone who thinks dramatically raising pay because its the right thing to do is a good idea

gt;well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable   yes there is an aspect of it that i think is the equivalent to ocean there are winds and waves of fortune which are often mistaken as entirely due to merit when in fact the merit may have been only a minor factor   gt;as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    i 'd agree   i 've looked into and decided to pass on the whole buy up a bunch of homes amp rent them out line   there was definitely an opportunity with foreclosure distressed sale properties in the area but after and seeking advice from several experienced landlords i have concluded that it is not the risk free passive income mechanism that a lot of think it is and there is substantial risk effort involved both in the form of capital investment repairs maintenance requiring both time amp money as well as the probability of an interrupted revenue steam bad renters are difficult expensive to deal with as well as other costs significantly increased property taxes especially on rentals etc   the truly big gains to my understanding anyway of being a landlord are the windfall cash out phase where having had renters paying the mortgage interest you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property but due to what i think and sincerely believe based on the of boomer die off i am fairly certain that said payoff will not be anywhere near as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past if the payoff even exists at all and is n't a net loss especially in light of the work effort investment involved   will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    depends on what you mean by stocks the overall market is one thing specific stocks can be quite a different story while it is an extreme example note the dramatic difference between aapl vs the dow during the past = = = = nasdaq etc   basically the whole idea of passive mindless set it and forget it gains from investments being the path to wealth has to go bye bye it was never really real to begin with unless you timed the market just right and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway   gt;for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    i guess i take the long term historical view that the very concept of some guaranteed retirement was simply an a lucky generation or two got away with it by accident in the timing of their birth something they really had no input into   instead i think one will always need to be working in some manner or another actively overseeing ones investments and remaining agile in response   and of course there is risk involved in that as if there is really any reason we should expect there not to be anyone who thinks that way imo is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history   the best i think one can do is to truly diversify and that does not mean mutual funds to separate your eggs into various baskets holding some major part in solid as solid as can be form even with the possibility of zero return and/or some loss i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt some pm 's in physical form etc having other assets in what are fairly solid bets based on demographic trends company quality etc and then some things several small bets that are long shots but potentially high return things where just one win can not only offset a dozen non performers losers but gain you a substantial real profit   basically i think one has to use their mind and available information which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed considered and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain crap shoot aspect to everything and that big winners are just as often either scam artists who often get their think enron or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place at the right time were dealt the right cards and subsequently made the right bets due to wiki and other biases we just do n't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been winners but just not large prominent enough to gain fame amp recognition much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with
