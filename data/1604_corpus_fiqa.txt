get your appraised   do n't let whoever does the appraisal be the same person whom you would sell it to logically must be worthy more than the raw gold that makes it up because somebody took the time to design patterns and do specialty craft to the metal

i have a buddy that used to run one of those companies that buys gold like the ones you see on tv here 's the deal 1 if the jewelry is n't total junk get it appraised making raw materials into jewelry obviously increases the value since you ca n't buy jewelry for the price of raw gold in many cases it will be worth more as jewelry but not always depends on the piece 2 those companies generally rely on the fact that people selling jewelry to a gold dealer are in a hurry to get cash and are very negotiable on what they will take for it depending on how predatory they are you will probably get between 50 and 75 of the market rate they make a living on the spread and people 's need for quick cash they usually resell it immediately to a 3rd party that actually it down and it   so the short answer to your question is no you wo n't get close to market value with these companies you would do better if you did n't have to go through the middle man but then those final buyers are n't generally the ones who have set up shop to deal with the general public

wall street salaries are rather exorbitant but its influence is far from insignificant   do you know where pensions come from the money that veterans and retirees rely on to survive hedge funds   how do the firms and companies that employ all those workers listed in greater numbers institutional money management aka hedge funds as a small subset    a company in distress and is in threat of laying off thousands of employees what can help it a private equity firm that will actively work to save and restore the company for it 's own profit but the employees will still have jobs    no large company with tens of thousands of employees can exist right now without the capital raising and transaction advisory services of an investment bank stock trading as a means to grow personal wealth would not exist    while true these institutions make a disproportionate amount money you must consider why nearly all front office jobs on wall street have hours investment banking analysts have up to 100 hours a week that 's salary per hour hedge fund managers wake up at night sweating to check asia markets to see if they 'll still have a job these are not the suburban 9 5 jobs where you can actually have weekends the high salary comes from an extremely rare skillset that 's taught only from experience not in schools high stress and commitment and the highest quality of labor mostly ivy on wall street they 've worked their asses off for these jobs    salary has to do with supply and demand i have the respect for janitorial workers because they do what we do n't want to do but their pay is n't great because anyone can be a janitor if most people in the country could build a portfolio with a sharpe ratio higher than 2 that billions of pension dollars would rely on then we wo n't have such high hedge fund salaries for example

one of the biggest laws in economics is that if an opportunity is very profitable and is very easily even by complete beginners then it will very soon stop being profitable that 's how the market works if you buy stock when it is at the lowest then you are making money but most of the time someone else is losing money and if there was a magic hour of the day when buying would be the most profitable then soon everybody would want to buy at that time and no one would want to sell anything so the scheme would collapse

the point of the enrollment penalty is basically the same as the aca penalty   any sort of health insurance or really any insurance is funded by creating a risk pool of high and low risk people and pricing it so that the overall payments cover the total risk    that means however that on average the low risk people end up paying more than their share more than it would have cost them without the insurance any provider agreements to charge less which is significant in the health insurance business   of course some of them do end up using more than they pay but not on average assuming the risk was calculated accurately while there is n't really a completely low risk pool in medicare there is a significant difference in utilization = cost between younger 65 70 and older   as such for many health 65 year olds it would be beneficial to not enroll in medicare right away delay a few years if they 're fully healthy and wait until they are less healthy   since medicare wo n't turn you away for pre existing conditions that 's a risk some would take in order to accommodate for that medicare effectively says if you did n't help subsidize the costs of the high users when you were younger you need to pay more to make up for that fact hence the enrollment penalty    the new york times explains this in part in a 2006 article discussing part d which was new that year and has a similar penalty the purpose of the late enrollment penalty is to encourage people to    sign up as soon as possible before they have significant drug costs

my understanding is that credit card companies are allowed to accept retirement income as part of the income that would qualify you for credit the consumer finance protection bureau issued a final rule amendment to regulation z the regulations around truth in lending act in 2013 in response to some of the tightening of credit that resulted from the credit card act of 2009   the final rule allows for credit issuers to consider income and assets to which such consumers have a reasonable expectation of access page 1   on page 75 it outlines some examples other sources of income include interest or    dividends retirement benefits public assistance alimony child support and separate    maintenance payments current or reasonably expected income    also includes income that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is    an e.g. an individual deposit account or joint account assets include for    example savings accounts and investments fannie mae explicitly mentions ira distributions in its documentation requirements on mortgage applications   for them they require that the income be expected to continue for at least three years after the date of the mortgage application lenders can reject or lower your credit limit for just about any reason that they want but it seems appropriate for you to include your retirement distributions in your income for credit applications

there is some magic involved in that calculation because what health insurance is worth to you is not necessarily the same it is worth for the employer two examples that illustrate the extreme ends of the spectrum let 's say you or a family member have a chronic or a serious illness especially if it is a preexisting condition for instance cancer in that case health insurance can be worth literally millions of dollars to you even if you are a the value of health insurance can be substantial sometimes it could even make financial sense in that case to accept a very low paying job on the other extreme of the scale if you are very young and healthy many people decide to forego insurance in that case the value of health insurance can be as little as the penalty usually 2 of your taxable income i believe

though it seems you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock including the fact that it 's at its 52-week high and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward   if you think it 's going to go up even further   more than the return on your other options for where to put the money keep the stock   if you think it 's peaked and will be going down now 's a good time to sell to put it another way if you did n't already have this stock would you buy it today your choice is just about the same you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares or the shares    which do you think is worth more you also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio   some are probably a larger percentage than others and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio   it may be time to do some rebalancing which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large as a of your portfolio and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you 're not as invested in as you would like to be   this might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio if part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional not purely financial you could sell now mark it as a win and move on to another opportunity   trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance but not everybody is into trading or money for money 's sake   what 's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life   if holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns from emotion based trading is acceptable   as cqm points out you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires expires the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls

part of the difficulty in this sort of planning is that you are also betting on future tax rates and comparing them with current taxes   if you are in a low tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one when you take the money out it is better to pay the taxes now   if you are in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower one when you retire take the money out then it is better to defer the taxes until then   if you think that future sessions of congress will decide to tax withdrawals from roth accounts then you should contribute to traditional accounts   the problem is that you do n't know with certainty what the future will bring so you have to make educated guesses about what might happen and what you can do now to protect yourself from it ideally plan so that even if the bad things happen you will be reasonably comfortable

i read a really good that my credit union gave me years ago written by a former car salesman about negotiation tactics with car dealers wish i could find it again but i remember a few of the main points   1 never negotiate based on the monthly payment amount car salesmen love to get you into thinking about the monthly loan payment and often start out by asking what you can afford for a payment they know that they can essentially charge you whatever they want for the car and make the payments hit your budget by tweaking the loan terms length down payment etc   2 new cars only do n't negotiate on the price directly it is extremely hard to compare prices between dealerships because it is very hard to find exactly the same combination of options instead negotiate the markup amount over dealer invoice   3 negotiate one thing at a time a favorite shell game of car dealers is to get you to negotiate the car price trade in price and financing all at one time unless you are a rain man mathematical genius do n't do it doing this makes it easy for them to make concessions on one thing and take them right back somewhere else minus $ 500 on the new car plus $ 200 through an extra half point on financing etc   4 handling the trade in   5 of the time the i forgot to mention extra items are a ripoff they make huge bonuses for selling this extremely overpriced junk you do n't need     6 scrutinize everything on the sticker price i 've seen car dealers have the balls to add a line item for marketing costs at around $ 500 then claim with a straight face that unlike other dealers they are just being upfront about their expenses instead of hiding them in the price of the car pure bunk if you negotiate based on an offset from the invoice instead of sticker price it helps you avoid all this nonsense since the manufacturer most assuredly did not include marketing costs on the dealer invoice 7 call around before closing the deal car dealers can be a little about this but they often have an internet sales person assigned to handle this type of deal once you know what you want but before you buy get the model number and all the codes for the options then call 2 3 dealers and try to get a quote over the phone or e mail on that exact car again get the quote in terms of markup from dealer invoice price not sticker price going through the internet sales guy does n't at all mean you have to buy on the internet i still suggest going down to the dealership with the best price and test driving the car in person the internet guy is just a sales guy like all the rest of them and will be happy to meet with you and talk through the deal in person update after recently going through this process again and talking to a bunch of dealers i have a few things to add the price posted on the internet is often the dealer 's bottom line number because of sites like and other car marketplaces that let you shop the car across dealerships they have a lot of incentive to put their rock bottom prices online where they know people aggressively comparison shop get the price of the car using the stock number from multiple sources dealer web site ebay motors etc and find the lowest price advertised then either print or take a screenshot of that price dealers sometimes change their prices up or down between the time you see it online and when you get to the dealership i just bought a car where the price went up $ 1,000 overnight the sales guy brought up the website and tried to convince me that i was confused i just pulled up the screenshot on my iphone and he stopped arguing i 'm not certain but i got the feeling that there is some kind of bait switch law that says if you can prove they posted a price they have to honor it in at least two dealerships they got very and backed away slowly from their bargaining position when i offered proof that they had posted the car at a lower price 8) the sales guy has ultimate authority on the deal and does n't need approval inevitably they will leave the room to run the deal by my boss financing guy mom this is just a game and negotiating trick to serve two purposes   to keep you in the dealership longer not shopping at competitors   so they can good cop bad cop you in the negotiations on price that is insult your offer without making you upset at the guy in front of you   to make it harder for you to walk out of the negotiation and compromise more readily   let me clarify that last point they are using a psychological sales trick to make you feel like an ass for wasting the guy 's time if you walk out on the deal after sitting in his office all afternoon especially since he gave you free coffee and sodas also if you have personally invested a lot of time in the deal so far it makes you feel like you wasted your own time if you do n't cross the goal line as soon as one side of a negotiation the option to walk away from the deal the power shifts significantly to the other side bottom line do n't feel guilty about walking out if you ca n't get the deal you want remember the sales guy is the one that dragged this thing out by playing hide and seek with you all day he wasted your time not the reverse

maybe a bit off topic but i suggest reading rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki an investment is something that puts money to your pocket if your properties do n't put money to your pocket and this seems to be the case then they 're not an investment instead they drain money from you pocket therefore you should instead turn these investments into real investments make everything to earn some money using them not to earn money somewhere else to cover the loses they create if that 's not possible get rid of them and find something that puts money into your pocket

costs are almost entirely salaries apart from all the usual costs incurred by running a large complex business   are servicing debt that is getting up around the m mark this is debt racked up by the family since purchasing the team as well as debt they took with them to the team   what sort of factors would affect their share price   product endorsements ticket prices attendance and merchandise sales are all important contributors but also performance in the domestic league and in domestic and european cups are also factors should their participation falter for any reason that through everything decrease in brand exposure and this is along with the debt problem the biggest risk edit by the way you are aware that this is an nyse ipo you can see how they have done on the ftse over the past 10 years or so

really you should only use words you understand particularly if you 're going to throw one single word into an argument and act as if that 's all you need to say   if the price were perfectly elastic then for every increase in cost in airline flights people would spend exactly enough less on flights to counteract that     what you mean is that price will mitigate this   but in fact since the elasticity of the market is almost certainly negative like almost all markets the airlines will in fact lose some money for every such tax put on them   less money than the cost of the tax yes because of the of the market but some   wiki

to add to mrchrister 's answer   canada also has a consumer price index cpi used to measure inflation that is distinct and separate from that maintained by the united states there are differences in inflation between the u.s. and canada because our currencies are different and there may be different items in the basket of goods that constitutes the index you can find current information on the canadian cpi at statistics canada here latest release from the consumer price index also the bank of canada our central bank maintains a free online inflation calculator   the boc 's inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in today 's dollars   for instance $ 100 in 1970 dollars had the same purchasing power under the cpi as $ in 2009 dollars and you 're right if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation then in theory you have lost purchasing power   so anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in cpi   of course some employers are counting on you not knowing that because any increase that 's less than cpi is effectively a salary decrease which could mean more profit for them if they are able to increase their prices revenues at inflation or better finally consider that salary wage increases also contribute to inflation   perhaps you 've heard of the wage price inflation spiral   if you have n't there 's more on that here and here

i wrote a little program one time to try to do this   i think i wrote it in python or something the idea was to have a list of projected expenses where each one would have things like the amount the date of the next transaction the frequency of the transaction and so on   the program would then simulate time determining when the next transaction would be updating balances and so on   you can actually do a very similar thing with a spreadsheet where you basically have a list of expenses that you manually paste in for each month in advance   simply keep a running balance of each row and make sure you do n't forget any transactions that should be happening this works great for fixed expenses or expenses that you know how much they are going to be for the next month   if you do n't know you can estimate for instance you can make an educated guess at how much your electric bill will be the next month if you have n't gotten the bill yet and you can estimate how much you will spend on fuel based on reviewing previous months and some idea of whether your usage will differ in the next month   for variable expenses i would always err on the side of a larger amount than i expected to spend   it is n't going to be possible to budget to the exact penny unless you lead a very simple life but the extra you allocate is important to cushion unexpected and unavoidable once you have this done for expenses against your bank account you can see what your low water mark is for the month or whatever time period you project out to   if this is above your minimum then you can see how much you can safely allocate to e.g. paying off debt   throwing a credit card into the mix can make things a bit more predictable in the current month especially for unpredictable amounts but it is a bit more complicated as now you have a second account that you have to track that has to get deducted from your first account when it becomes due in the following month   i am assuming a typical card where you have something like a 25 day grace period to pay without interest along with up to 30 days after the expense before the grace period starts depending on the relationship between your cut off date and when the actual expense occurs

intellectually and logically it should n't bother me for a second to charge something for a buck   it 's a losing proposition for the merchant but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me   they 're making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment right   but the more i charge as opposed to paying cash the more cash back i get in my old ish age i 've gotten a little and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because i understand the business costs but it 's not a matter of caring what other people think accepting credit cards or not is a business decision   it 's usually a good one   but with that decision come the rules which up until about a year ago meant that merchants could n't set a minimum charge amount   now that 's not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than $ 10.00 in the end it 's a matter of how much you 're willing to pay in order to influence people 's thinking of you because the business financial benefits of doing one or the other are pretty clear

even though the article does n't actually use the word discount i think the corresponding word you are looking for is premium the words are used quite frequently even outside of the context of negative rates in general bonds are issued with coupons close to the prevailing level of interest rates i.e. their price is close to par 100 dollar price suppose yields go up the next day then the price moves inversely to yields and that bond will now trade at a discount to par less than 100 dollar price and vice versa if yields went down prices go up and the bond is now at a premium to par greater than 100 dollar price

if you 're making $ 80k and you 're consulting for an extra $ or $ you 're earning a total of $   that 's assuming you do it for a full calendar year of course   either way assuming you can deduct exclude at least $ 11k of income as almost everyone can you 're paying 25 on your marginal dollars   this also assumes you 're single if you 're married filing jointly this may not be true   note you 're right at the edge of the 25 bracket if you earn this in a full calendar year but if you have a 401k health insurance or other reductions you 'll be fine   additionally for this year you 'll be under again assuming single and no other income because you are n't earning a full year 's worth assuming your $ 80k is precisely taken care of by your regular withholding then you will literally pay in additional taxes $ 100 per week   so if you are paid biweekly you need to add $ in withholding on your w-4   if you expect to overpay taxes if you own a house with a mortgage for example you often do you can reduce it some but adding $ paycheck should bring you right to where you were before the extra income the general rule is to calculate your marginal not effective tax rate before the new income assuming default withholding takes care of that and then withhold the marginal rate for the new income checking that the new income does n't push the marginal rate up if so calculate in two parts the part in the lower marginal rate and the part in the higher marginal rate you can google 2014 tax brackets or look at the irs tax tables for detailed information about marginal rates

the focus of this article is n't on tax revenue the author is discussing income disparity    the laffer curve does n't tell the whole story you are correct a higher tax rate does not imply higher tax revenue and a lower tax rate does not imply less revenue changing tax rates is n't going to significantly affect tax revenue however there are a broad range of other effects when changing tax rates in evaluating adjustments to tax rates our focus needs to be on these secondary effects    we are taxed on income not   when i sell you a $ 10 widget that i paid a worker $ 2 to produce from $ 5 of materials i pay taxes on the $ 3 net income not the $ 10 revenue i received from you     the main way businesses avoid high marginal tax rates is by increasing deductible expenses such that their net income after these expenses keeps them below their desired tax bracket   it is far better to spend that money on something that can benefit the business than simply give it to the government any businessman would rather keep his earnings if possible if that is not possible he 'd prefer to spend them on something that can help him rather than squandering it on junk or giving it away to the government    for most businesses the largest deductible expense is payroll any decent employer would prefer to pay out a christmas bonus instead of giving that same amount to uncle sam any businessman would prefer to pay for additional advertising or a charitable donation to a worthy cause rather than paying the irs    run up the top tier tax rate and suddenly businessmen feel a compelling need to lower their prices and pay their workers more run up the tax rate and income disparity shrinks   run up the tax rate and you put more money in the hands of consumers

document how you came to have the stuff in the first place first to defend against potential government inquiry and second to establish that you held the asset more than one year so you qualify for long term capital gains rate   i would n't sell it privately all at once if you can avoid it    if you can prove you held it more than a year   you should pay the long term capital gains tax rate which is fairly low   you 'll keep most of it   a huge windfall often goes very badly people do n't change their financial habits burn through their winnings shockingly fast overspend it and wind up deep in debt   at the end of the crazy train their lives end up worse    that was n't your question but you 'll do better if you 're on guard for that with good planning and a desire to invest it in things which give you deferred income in the future that 's the cooler thing when your investments mean you do n't have to go to work i do n't mean donate all of it to charity but feel free   if you hold a security more than one year and donate it to charity you get a tax deduction for the appreciated value even though the security did n't actually cost you that link do not convert the btc to cash then donate the cash donate it as btc   your tax deduction works against your highest tax bracket   if you are paying in a 28 tax bracket your next $ 100 of income has $ 28 tax then for every $ 100 of charitable donation you get $ 28 back on federal it does the same to state tax and you also avoid the 10 15 capital gains tax because you did n't sell the securities   do your 1040 both ways and note the difference your charitable deduction of appreciated securities is capped at 30 of agi   any excess will carryover and becomes a tax deduction for the next year and it can carryover for several years   use a donor advised fund if you have are donating more than $ 5000 you do n't need to search for a charity that will take bitcoin and you also do n't need to pick a charity now   instead open a special type of giving account called a donor advised fund   the daf itself is a charity it specializes in accepting complex donations and liquidating them into cash   the cash credits to your giving account   you take the tax deduction in the year you give to the daf   then when you want to give to a charity you tell the daf to donate on your    you can tell them to give on your behalf anonymously or merely conceal your address so you do n't get the endless charity junk mail    the daf lets you hold the money in index funds so your charity nest egg can grow with the market   mine has more than doubled thanks to the market   this money is no longer yours at this point you ca n't give it back to yourself only to licensed charities the fidelity donor advised fund makes a big thing of taking bitcoin and i really like them i love my daf and it has been a charitable giving   it turns you into a philanthropist and that changes you life in ways i can not describe certainly makes me more level headed about money    lottery winner syndrome is just not a risk for me partly because i 'm now on the board of charities and oversee an endowment   donating generally will reduce suspicion criminals do n't do that but donating to a daf even moreso   since the daf would have to return ill gotten gains they 're involved   their lawyers will back you up   the prosecutor is up against a billion dollar corporation instead of just you   with fidelity particularly bitcoin is a crusade for them and their lawyers know how to defend bitcoin   a fidelity daf is a good play for that reason alone imo   the gory details presumably you are donating to regular charities or a donor advised fund and these are 50 limit organizations since it 's capital gains you have a 30 limit if your donation is more than 30 of agi or if you have carryover from last year you use worksheet 2 in publication you plug your donations into line 4 then the worksheet grinds through all the math and shows what part you deduct this year and what part you carryover to the next year   i specifically asked managers at two whether they were ok with someone donating a complex asset to the daf and immediately giving the entire cash amount to a charity   the daf does n't get any fees if you do that   they said not only are they ok with it most of their donors do exactly that and most daf accounts are empty   they make it on the 0.6 a year custodial fee on the other accounts and charitable giving to them     mind you you can only donate to type charities what irs calls 50 limit organizations   this actually protects you from donating to organizations who lie about their status   i 'm not with fidelity but i am a satisfied daf customer   the daf funds its overhead by deducting 0.6 per year from your giving account if you invest the funds in a mutual fund within the daf that investment pays the 0.08 to 1.5 expense ratio of the fund    i can live with that   i just the value of donating $ 100 of appreciated security instead of taking it as capital gains income   28 fed tax 15 fed cap gains 8 state tax on both   take the $ 100 as income pay $ 23 in cap gains tax   donate $ 100 in securities the $ 23 tax goes away since you did n't sell it really   the $ 100 charitable deduction offsets $ 100 in income also saving you $ 36 in regular income tax   net tax savings $ 59   however you lost the $ 100   so you are net $ 41 poorer   it costs you $ 41 to donate $ 100 to charity   this gets better in higher brackets

in layman 's terms oil on the commodities market has a spot price and a future price the spot price is what the last guy paid to buy a barrel of oil right now and thus a pretty good indicator of what you 'll have to pay the futures price is what the last guy paid for a futures contract where they agreed to buy a barrel of oil for $ x at some point in the future futures contracts are a form of hedging a futures contract is usually sold at a price somewhere between the current spot price and the true expected future spot price the buyer saves money versus paying the spot price while the seller still makes a profit but the buyer of a futures contract is basically betting that the spot price as of delivery will be higher while the seller is betting it will be lower futures contracts are available for a wide variety of acceptable future dates and form a curve when plotted on a graph that will trend in one direction or the other now as chad said oil companies basically get their cut no matter what oil stocks are generally a good long term bet as far as the best short term time to buy in to an oil stock look for very short windows when the spot and near future price of gasoline is trending downward but oil is still on the uptick during those times the oil companies are paying their existing high contracts for oil but when the spot price is low it affects futures prices which will affect the oil companies margins day traders will see that the sky is falling and sell off driving the price down temporarily that 's when you buy in pretty much the only other time an oil stock is a guaranteed win is when the entire market takes a swan dive and then bottoms out oil has such a built in demand for the foreseeable future that regardless of how bad it gets you will make money on an oil stock so when the entire market 's in a panic and everyone 's heading for gold t debt etc buy the major oil stocks across the spectrum even if one stock tanks chances are really good that another company will see that and offer a buyout jacking the bought company 's stock which you then sell and reinvest the cash into the buying company which will have taken a hit on the news due to the huge drop in working capital of course the one thing to watch for in the headlines is any news that renewables have become much more attractive than oil you wait in the next few decades some enterprising individual will invent a super efficient solar cell that provides all the power a real practical car will ever need and that is simultaneously integrated into wind farms making oil gas plants when that happens oil will be a thing of the past

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

the exact percentages depend on many things not just location for example everyone needs food   if you have a low income the percentage of your income spent on food would be much higher than for someone that has a high income any budgeting guidelines that you find are just a starting point   you need to look at your own income and expenses and come up with your own spending plan start by listing all of the necessities that you have to spend on   for example your basic necessities might be fund those categories and any other fixed expenses that you have   whatever you have left is available for other things such as and anything else that you can think of to spend money on   if you can save money on some of the necessities above it will free up money on the discretionary categories below    because your income and priorities are different than everyone else your budget will be different than everyone else too   if you are new to budgeting you might find that the right budgeting software can make the task much easier   ynab everydollar or mvelopes are three popular choices

the bottom line is that this just does not work and as such you should not do it   here is a question that you really need to think about   how will you handle non payments   how will you handle it when they talk about purchases they made or vacations they went on when they have been short for the last three months   yes it will happen the majority of people who engage in debt consolidation which you are proposing end up with the consolidated debt and more consumer debt   one can not borrow themselves out of debt   carrying credit card debt is a sign of poor money management and improper spending behavior   that behavior will not change if you bail them out with the consolidation   they need to find a way to work their way out of this situation by budgeting living a more lifestyle and earning more    encouraging them to do so will serve them far better then your generous attempts to reduce the pain of their own making in the end it is always a parent 's desire to help their children   if you can afford to give then it is well within your right to do so   it is also within your right to qualify that giving with behavioral conditions   however if you can not afford to give it is best not to loan

the way the question is worded it is slightly opinion based just to point out    tax benefits upto 50000 inr is tax free when invested here this is actually 200,000 inr under 80c. so if you invest max of 150,000 in other instruments in 80c you can still invest 50,000 into nps hopefully it will provide some money that i could probably use to buy a house kid 's education kid 's marriage there are very few withdrawal options generally in the current scenario by the time you retire you would already have house kid would have got married answers given the current data is it a worthwhile investment it is a good investment option available it is up to individual to select this or invest else where if yes would be better to fix choice at 50 in e and 25 in c and e or go for the auto choice as you are young it is better to have max 50 in equity and actively monitor this and change the percentage as you near the retirement age if you do n't have time or are not financial or one is plain simple lazy going with auto choice makes sense bad investment because if you put the same money into equity oriented mutual funds then you will get better returns this depends if you are currently investing everything into equity then yes at absolute level the returns are high however if you are investing into equity and debt to achieve a balance then nps is doing it automatically for you as the nps has very low costs there is substantial advantage in some years 2013 2014 the nps equity return has been excellent and exceeded leading mutual funds other aspect edits the annuities need to invest in guaranteed risk free instruments generally bonds as the rates are locked for life they need to factor things like average life expectancy demographics etc this is largely statistical similar to how the insurance premiums are decided this is adjusted periodically say they offer 6.5 for 100 people the investments into bonds is yielding only 6 then for next 100 people they would offer 5.5 however if the mortality increases i.e. 50 people die at age of 70 they just need to adjust it to 5.75 for next 100 so there are quite a few parameters that go in and models output what the rate should be offered at times the corpus manager may take a hedge to minimize downside this is a specialized subject and there no dummies that show how rates are determined it is also a trade secret

its not just citi and bofa even barclays hsbc and other large banks are trading below book value in markets they are listed are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks there no particular assets given the current economic situation most banks are not making good returns i.e. expected returns of markets are around 10 12 and the returns getting generated are around 4 6 the overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to at the business model in short term and generate more revenue the market believes that banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value note book value is derived in ideal conditions i.e. when the company is healthy if any company were to sell the assets in distress the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than book value its also to be noted that typically banks would not close out and hence book value to an extent is just an indicator or is it a residual based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today the 2008 has gone past this is more recent if you look most of these banks were doing quite well till last year and had recovered substantially after 2008

p e is a useful tool for evaluating the price of a company but only in comparison to companies in similar industries especially for industries with well defined cash flows   for example if you compared consolidated edison nyse ed to hawaiian electric nyse he you 'll notice that he has a significantly higher pe all things being equal that means that he may be overpriced in comparison to ed as an investor you need to investigate further to determine whether that is true he is unique in that it is a utility that also operates a bank so you need to take that into account you need to think about what your goal is when you say that you are a conservative investor and look at the big picture not a magic number if conservative to you means capital preservation you need to ensure that you are in investments that are diversified and appropriate given the interest rate situation in 2011 that means your bonds holding need to be in short duration high quality securities equities should be weighted towards large cap with smaller holdings of international or commodity associated funds consider a target date or blended fund like one of the vanguard life strategy funds

there are two distinct questions that may be of interest to you both questions are relevant for funds that need to buy or sell large orders that you are talking about the answer depends on your order type and the current market state such as the level 2 order book suppose there are no iceberg or hidden orders and the order book image courtesy of this question currently is   an unlimited at market buy order for 12,000 shares gets filled immediately it gets 1,100 shares at at and 1,200 at after this order the lowest ask price becomes and the highest bid is obviously still because the previous order was a market order a limited buy order for 12,000 shares with a price limit of gets the first two fills just like the market order 1,100 shares at and at however the remainder of the order will establish a new bid price level for 1,200 shares at it is possible to enter an unlimited buy order that the book however such a trade would often be considered a mis trade and either i be cancelled by the broker ii be cancelled or undone by the exchange or iii hit the maximum price move a stock is allowed per day limit up funds and banks often have to buy or sell large quantities just like you have described however they usually do not punch through order book levels as i described before instead they would spread out the order over time and buy a smaller quantity several times throughout the day simple algorithms attempt to get a price close to the time weighted average price or volume weighted average price vwap and would buy a smaller amount every n minutes despite splitting the order into smaller pieces the price usually moves against the trader for many reasons there are many models to estimate the market impact of an order before executing it and many brokers have their own model for example deutsche bank there is considerable research on market impact if you are interested i understand the general principal that when significant buy orders    comes in relative to the sell orders price goes up and when a    significant sell order comes in relative to buy orders it goes down i consider this statement wrong or at least misleading first stocks can jump in price without or with very little volume consider a company that releases a negative earnings surprise over night on the next day the stock may open 20 lower without any orders having matched for any price in between the price moved because the perception of the stocks value changed not because of buy or sell pressure second buy and sell pressure have an effect on the price because of the underlying reason and not necessarily only because of the mechanics of the market assume you were prepared to sell stock but suddenly there 's a lot of buzz and your colleagues are talking about buying it would you still sell it for the same price i would n't i would try to find out how much they are prepared to buy it for in other words buy pressure can be the consequence of successful marketing of the stock and the marketing buzz is what changes the price

there are different approaches but here is what we do and what i recommend   now that you are officially a married couple open a joint bank account and eliminate your individual accounts   there are several reasons for this having a joint account promotes unity and teamwork   when you only have a joint account you do not have your income and her income or your expenses and her expenses   you work together in everything   you discuss your goals and set your household budget together   if one of you makes more money than the other that person is no longer worth more because your incomes are pooled together   if one person with a higher income has more in their account than the other person does it can lead to envy which you do not want in your marriage having a joint account is more efficient and makes more sense   with separate accounts who pays the rent mortgage   who pays the utilities or buys the food   if you have separate accounts it takes a lot of work to worry about what is fair when deciding how to divide up the expenses   with a single household budget and a joint account you decide together what the household expenses are and they get paid from one account   if one of you has debt you both have debt   you work together to get it paid off and strengthen your financial situation in the process having a joint account forces you to discuss your finances together   working toward common financial goals together is crucial in a strong marriage but if you maintain your separate accounts you might be tempted to put off these discussions until you are forced to by life circumstances   it is better to work together from the start and joining your finances facilitates that you are intending your marriage to last   live your financial life like you believe that you are a team for life   if you live in a community property state separate accounts are a fiction anyway everything is treated as if it was pooled together in the event of a divorce i understand that if you are used to having your own money it can be difficult to give up that sole control over your income but in my opinion it is worth it   you will certainly hear of examples from couples who maintain separate accounts and make it work   in my humble opinion combining your finances completely is easier to do right

the problem is you are trying to qualify for a loan that has a 25 down payment using money you do n't have which defeats the purpose of having a down payment the best thing to do is have your parents buy the house for you you then rent the house from them where your rent is equal to the mortgage + x. your parents then put x into savings account for you and then once you have 25 in that account they gift it to you and you purchase the house from them using that 25 as the downpayment for the mortgage

yes the definition of unreasonable shows as not guided by or based on good sense 100 years require a high risk can your one stock double or even go up three fold sure but that would likely be a small part of your portfolio overall long term you are not likely to beat the market by such high numbers   that said i had 2 years of returns well over 100 1998 and 1999 the s&p was up and and i was very leverage in high tech stock options as others mentioned leverage was key mark used the term gearing which i think is leverage when 2000 started crashing i had taken enough off the table to end the year down 12 vs the s&p -10 but this was down from a near 50 gain in q1 of that year as the crash continued i was no longer leveraged and have n't been since the last 12 years or so i 've happily lagged the s&p by a few basis points   also note buffet has returned an amazing on average for the last 30 years vs the s&p 16 is far from 100 the last 10 year however his return was a modest 8.6 just .1 above the s&p.

but on june 28 the town authorized a declaration of fiscal emergency a step california cities can take before bankruptcy in this case it gives officials in the affluent the power to expedite a referendum on new fees to boost its revenue which has been restrained by a lackluster retail base and property tax limits the state enacted almost 40 years ago   we just do n’t have enough revenue to take us through the future for many more years before we would really be in some of the situations other cities are where they ’re laying off mass numbers of employees or declaring bankruptcy town manager robert said in an interview   get the latest on global politics in your inbox every day get our newsletter daily   enter your email   sign up the community where the median family income is $ a year illustrates an irony for some at the center of the california ’s latest economic boom while real estate prices have surged the local tax collections have n’t necessarily followed the same trajectory because of proposition 13 the 1978 ballot measure that keeps tax bills from rising by more than inflation or 2 percent a year as a result local government revenues are growing more slowly than the rest of the u.s. according to a state analysis leaving some seeking other ways to raise money   in moraga where the council discussed establishing a laureate position before approving the fiscal distress declaration lowering headcount is n’t the first priority the town ’s $ 8.5 million budget this year authorizes about 36 full time workers members instead opted to reduce services such as park maintenance in the community about 20 miles east of san francisco   we ’re not willing to hurt the public first said we ’re not going to lay off half of our employees and have the quality of life of all of our citizens really be impacted    moraga ’s declaration has n’t affected its standing on wall street its $ million in outstanding debt is rated second highest by s&amp;p global ratings one of its bonds due april was valued on july 5 at percentage point more than benchmark debt little changed from the percentage point seen on the day of the fiscal emergency declaration that spread stood at 1.16 percentage point at 2016 year end according to data compiled by bloomberg   the squeeze on moraga stems in part from two infrastructure failures the damage to a bridge in april and a that became such a civic event that residents threw it a sarcastic birthday celebration though officials are hoping for state and federal reimbursements the cost to fix both depleted its savings leaving the city vulnerable to another emergency the general fund boosted modestly with this year ’s anticipated $ surplus has about $ 1.6 million in reserves   the fiscal emergency declaration allows moraga to put any revenue raising measure on the ballot when it wants instead of waiting for a regularly scheduled election options being include proposing a flat fee on property or a utility tax said the town will poll residents by phone to see what ’s preferable   moraga should look to cut personnel expenses first said seth an unsuccessful council candidate and the only resident to speak about the issue at the board meeting he criticized the council ’s decision to award raises to employees two weeks before issuing the emergency declaration   i ’m concerned that the simple solution would be to raise taxes than to address some of the issues under the control of the town manager said in an interview the compensation for a small town is unaffordable   said the town ’s costs are low compared to others in the county and that it must remain competitive if we offered no raises we would lose people

p e is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price   you take share price divided by annual earnings per share   you can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4 you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share it has little to do with a company 's actual finances apart from the earnings per share   it does n't say much about the health of a company 's balance sheet and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy   it 's mostly a measure of the market 's assumptions of the company 's ability to grow earnings or maintain it 's current earnings growth    a share price of $ 40 trading for a p e ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn $ 40 per share it means there 's current annual earnings per share of $ 4   a different company may also be earning $ 4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of $ 400   by this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other   one just commands more faith in the future growth from the market to circle back to your question regarding a negative p e a negative p e ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings running at a loss   again this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy   increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk

you are mixing issues here and it 's tough for members to answer without more detail the current mortgage rate in your country for one   it 's also interesting to parse out your question i wish to safely invest money should i invest in real estate but then the text offers that it 's not an investment it 's a home to live in this is where the trouble is and it effectively creates 2 questions to address   the real question buy vs rent i know you mentioned euros fortunately mortgages are n't going to be too different lower higher and tax consequence but all can be adjusted the new york times offered a beautiful calculator is it better to rent or buy   for those not interested in viewing it they run the math and the simple punchline is this the home rent ratio can have an incredibly wide range i 've read real estate blogs that say the rent should be 2 of the home value that 's a 4 to 1 home rent per year a neighbor rented his higher end home and the ratio was over 25 to 1 i.e. the rent for the year was about 4 the value of the home it 's this range that makes the choice less than obvious   the second part of your question is how to stay safely invested if you fear your own currency will collapse that quickly into too speculative a question some will quickly say gold and others would point out that a stockpile of weapons ammo and food would be the best choice to survive that

since the bondholders have voted to reject the emergency manager 's plan which would have paid them pennies on the dollar the city is now attempting to discharge its short term and long term debt if they get what they want in court it is likely these bonds will become worthless even if they are only able to restructure the debt its likely that bondholders will need to accept large concessions however this may not be immediately reflected in bond prices as it 's very possible that the market for these bonds will be very limited in terms of who they could sell them to if you were to buy them now that would be a bet on some outcome other than bankruptcy and the discharge of the city 's long term obligations president obama has already stated that he monitoring the situation and it seems unlikely to me that after all of the support given to the auto industry in the last several years that the federal government will do nothing if only to avert job losses however i think it 's likely that state aid will be limited at best as michigan 's economy has been struggling for a number of years there are n't many large precedents to look at for guidance one of the largest public entities to declare bankruptcy orange county was a very different situation because this was due to malfeasance on the part of its investment manager whereas detroit 's situation is a much larger structural problem with its declining economy and tax base i think the key question will be whether the federal government will consider a detroit bankruptcy to be a large enough failure to take significant action

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

i 'd question whether a guaranteed savings instrument underperforming the stock market really is a risk or not   rather you reap what you there 's a trade off and one makes a choice   if one chooses to invest in a highly conservative low risk asset class then one should expect lower returns from it   that does n't necessarily mean the return will be lower stock markets could tank and a cd could look brilliant in hindsight but one should expect lower returns   this is what we learn from the risk return spectrum and modern portfolio theory you 've mentioned and discounted inflation risk already and that would've been one i 'd mention with respect to guaranteed savings yet one still accepts inflation risk in choosing the 3 cd because inflation is n't known in advance   if inflation happened to be 2 after the fact that just means the risk did n't materialize   but inflation could have been say 4 nevertheless i 'll try and describe the phenomenon of significantly underperforming a portfolio with more higher risk assets   i 'd suggest one of perhaps we can sum those up as the risk of investing alternatively if one were actually fully aware of the risk reward spectrum and mpt and still chose an excessive amount of low risk investments such that one would n't be able to attain reasonable investing goals then i 'd probably file the risk under psychological risk e.g. overly cautious excessive risk aversion yet the term psychological risk with respect to investing encompasses other situations as well e.g. chasing high returns fwiw the risk of also came to mind but i think that 's mostly used to describe the risk of choosing say an actively managed fund or individual stocks over a passive benchmark index investment more likely to match market returns

most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason let 's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them take your profits and ride off into the sunset   so you call your broker or log into your brokerage account and put them up for sale   he puts in an order somewhere the stock is sold and your account is credited seems simple right   well not so fast professionals i 'm keeping this simple so please do n't beat me up for it the way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as market makers   these are entities which sit between the markets and you and your broker and when you want to buy or sell a stock most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker   if you work with a large brokerage firm sometimes they 'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts but that 's another story it is normal for there to be many sometimes hundreds of market makers who are all trading in the same equity   the bigger the stock the more market makers it attracts   they all compete with each other for business and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock google apple and microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks it is very competitive   the way the makers compete is on price   it might surprise you to know that it is the market makers not the markets that decide what a stock will buy or sell for each market maker sets their own prices for what they 'll pay to buy from sellers for and what they 'll sell it to buyers for   this is called respectively the bid and the ask prices   so if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock   the prices you see for stocks are what are called the best bid and best ask prices   what that means is you are being shown the highest bid price what you can sell your shares for and the best ask price what you can buy those shares for because that 's what is required   that being said there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher   many times there will be a big of market makers all at the same bid ask or within fractions of a cent of each other all competing for business   trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can the point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at   they adjust those prices based among other factors on how much buying and selling volume they 're seeing   if they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they 'll start marking down their bid prices   this keeps them from paying too much for shares they 're going to have to find a buyer for eventually and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell   conversely if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system they 'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains since they 're selling you shares they bought from someone else presumably at a lower price   but they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades   sneaky eh depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you 're selling and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share 's price if the block is large enough then it 's possible it will not all sell to one market maker or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price this is a pretty complex subject as you can see and i 've cut a lot of corners and oversimplified much to keep it   but the short answer to your question is it depends hope this helps good luck

india is better as the exchange rate conversion will be better in the us banks or exchange rate do not hold much inr and likely to quote a much worse rate best way is to open hsbc premier accounts in both us and india and use their global transfers as in premier accounts the conversion rates are usually decent hsbc premier also has good tools to link two accounts so the process would be transparent best conversion rates are given by middle east banks or fx due to the large number of indians working there but i suspect opening a bank account in dubai might not be feasible

indeed you are correct sir but my response would be does the customer regulator not also have a model and can a financial company exist without these two stakeholders explicit endorsement models always have assumptions the key is figuring out what they are and why they should or should n't be made i would argue that any investor sophisticated enough to be around with leveraged etfs cds index tranches or illiquid long dated interest rate swaps better have a damn good reason to buy em and if their model breaks is that the fault of the bank or the customer

yes you can   this is known as a short selling against the box   in the old days this was used to delay a taxable event   you could lock in a gain without triggering a taxable event   any loss on one side of the box would be offset by a loss on the other side and vice versa   however the irs down on this and you will realize the gain on your long position as soon as you go short on the other side   see as to how to initiate the short cover just transfer the long position to the same account as your short position and make sure your broker covers the short   should be relatively easy

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

if i were in your shoes i 'd probably take the vanguard total market fund with admiral shares then worry about further diversification when there is more in the account many times when you diversify in to multiple funds you end up with a lot of specific security overlap   a lot of the big s&p 500 constituents will be in all of them etc   so while the 10 or so basis points difference in expense ratio does n't seem like enough of a reason not to spread in to multiple funds once you split up the money between large mid small cap funds and growth value dividend funds you 'll probably have a collection of holdings that looks substantially similar to a total market fund anyway unless you 're looking for international or some specific industry segment exposure and all of the money is going to equities anyway an inexpensive total market fund makes a lot of sense

nothing beats statistics like that found on morning star yahoo or google finance   when you are starting out there is no need to reinvent the wheel   pick a couple of mutual funds with good track records and start there    keep in mind the financial press to some degree has a vested interest in having their chase the next hot thing   so while sites like seeking alpha or money do provide some good advice there is also an element that their advertisers    the only peer to peer lending i would consider is lending club   however you are probably better off in the long run investing in mutual funds   one way to get involved in individual stocks without getting burned is to participate in dividend reinvestment plans drips   companies that have them tend to be very well established and they are structured to discourage trading   buying is easy dividend reinvestment is easy dividend payouts are easy but starting and selling   is kind of a pain   that is a good thing

you asked 3 questions here it 's best to keep them separate as these are pretty distinct different answers and each might already have a good detailed answer and so might be subject to closed as duplicate of that said i 'll address the question 1 it 's not an apples to apples comparison this is a life sciences fund i.e. a very specialized fund investing in one narrow sector of the market if you study market returns over time it 's easy to find sectors that have had a decade or even two that have beat the s&p by a wide margin the 5 year comparison makes this pretty clear for sake of comparison apple had twice the return of during the past 5 years the advisor charging 2 who was heavy in apple might look brilliant but the returns are not positively correlated to the expense involved a 10 or 20 year will always uncover funds or individual stocks that beat the indexes but the law of averages suggests that the next 10 or 20 years will still appear random

this is a good question and a question i have asked about whether to invest in a roth ira or a traditional ira this is my take on the picture i 'm not sure about your tax situation and how much you 'd have to pay for each conversion you did whether you have extra money to pay those taxes etc in my opinion i do n't think it would be a good idea to use your 401(k principal to pay taxes but to have the extra money to pay these when rolling over so you do n't lose any interest especially since you 're near the end of your snowball effect with interest in your retirement account here is a resource to consider also another thing to consider that i do n't really see much of on here is inflation if you 're going to be in the same tax bracket as you are now and if whatever you 're contributing to your 401(k or traditional ira is not bumping you down in the 15 bracket then i would suggest doing a roth ira i say this because to me when i retire i would have rather paid my taxes throughout the years i 'm 23 and in 25 marginal tax bracket in a roth ira and pay nothing when i 'm withdrawing in 30 years factors people forget to consider are that the cost of living is going to be much much higher for me down the road and the cost of sending a child to school is going to be much higher as well since your child is young consider this site for the cost of a college education for your child this is comparing the average cost of education for someone attending college in 2015 versus a child born in 2015 while this seems drastic and there could be a lot of different things that happen by that time it 's a decent illustration while the website provided certainly is n't validated by the doe i have read multiple articles about this and they are all very similar again other things could happen between now and your child 's college career but if college becomes free we 're paying for it and if it 's not free and raises at historical rates you 're paying for it i also do n't really want to comment on what is going to happen with taxes over the years i 'm not sure where you live i 'm in the u.s. but imo i believe they either a wo n't change or b will raise slightly as far as ss goes i think it 's fair and definitely more than reasonable to not expect ss in retirement i 'm definitely not counting on it

you can interpret prices in any way you wish but the commonly quoted price is the last price traded if your broker routes those orders unlikely because they will be considered unfair and will probably be busted by the exchange the only way to drive the price to the heights lows in your example is to have an overwhelming amount of quantity relative to the order book your orders will hit the opposing limit orders until your quantity is exhausted starting from the best price to the worst price this is the functional equivalent to a market order

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

if so then if company a never pays dividends to its shareholders then what is the point of owning company a 's stock the stock itself can go up in price this is not necessarily pure speculation either the company could just reinvest the profits and grow since you own part of a company your share would also increase in value the company could also decide to start paying dividend i think one rule of thumb is that growing companies wo n't pay out since they reinvest all profit to grow even more but very large companies like mcdonalds or microsoft who do n't really have much room left to grow will pay dividends more surely the right to one vote for company a 's board ca n't be that valuable   actually google for instance neither pays dividend nor do you get to vote basically all you get for your money is partial ownership of the company this still gives you the right to seize google assets if you go bankrupt if there 's any asset left once the creditors are done credit gets priority over equity what is it that i 'm missing what you are missing is that the entire concept of the dividend is an illusion there 's little qualitative difference between a stock that pays dividend and a stock that does n't if you were going to buy the stock then hold it forever and collect dividend you could get the same thing with a dividend less stock by simply waiting for it to gain say 5 value then sell of your stock and call the cash your dividend but wait you say that 's not the same my net worth has decreased guess what stocks that do pay dividend usually do drop in value right after the pay out and they drop by about the relative value of the dividend as well likewise you could take a stock that does pay dividend and make it look exactly like a non paying stock by simply taking every dividend you get and buying more of the same stock with it so from this simplistic point of view it is irrelevant whether the stock itself pays dividend or not there is always the same decision of whether to cut the goose or let it lay a few more eggs that every shareholder has to make it paying a dividend is essentially providing a different default choice but makes little difference with regards to your choices there is however more to it than simple return on investment arithmetic as i said the alternative to paying dividend is reinvesting profits back into the enterprise if the company decided to pay out dividend that means they think all the best investing is done and they do n't really have a particularly good idea for what to do with the extra money conversely not paying is like management telling the shareholders no we 're not done we 're still building our business so it can be a way of judging whether the company is concentrating on generating profit or growing itself needless to say the the market is wild and unpredictable and not everyone such assumptions furthermore as i said you can effectively overrule the decision by increasing or decreasing your position regardless of whether they have decided to pay dividend to begin with lastly there may be some subtle differences with regards to things like how the income is taxed and so on these do n't really have much to do with the market itself but the bureaucracy tacked onto the market

oh please most of the unsecured creditors who get screwed in bankruptcy are large banks they know the risk going in which is why unsecured lends at a high interest rate yes trade creditors often do get screwed but it 's a cost of doing business it 's why a vendor needs to monitor its receivables and watch for signs of insolvency and adjust the terms of trade accordingly   you should have made sure you were covered by brokerage insurance before handing money to a company like that the i 'm the little guy argument is just weak

i mean i was a bartender for years in college and on most saturdays i 'd work from in a giant crowd of sweaty drunk and sticky 18 24 year olds friends of mine worked in warehouses factories construction retail you name it the thing is our presence and physical effort was a business necessity    i think the disconnect between our viewpoints is that you see the remote work option as a service solely benefiting the employee which the employer has to bear at some hardship my thought is that the option is mutually beneficial and requiring 100 personal presence in the absence of a business case is an outdated ideology    consider this fewer on site employees means fewer sites this translates to millions saved in rent utilities insurance maintenance administrative staff and it infrastructure etc it also as the article mentions vastly expands the pool of available talent by removing geographical requirements not only that the option to work from home is in and of itself a feature which the ol' recruiting pipe as i alluded to earlier    the overarching logic is that there should be a quantifiable advantage attached to a decision like this and this advantage was again as the article mentions discovered by ibm 's own internal research efforts which supported remote work it does n't make a lot of sense strategically but i have n't worked for ibm for years so i could n't tell you what internal issues they might be struggling with

a while back i sold cars for a living   over the course of 4 years i worked for 3 different dealerships   i sold new cars at 2 and used at the last one when selling new cars i found that the majority of people buying the higher end cars honestly should n't have been 80%+   they almost always came in owing more on their trades then they were worth put down very little cash and were close to being financially strapped    from a financial perspective these deals were hard to close not because the buyer was picky but rather because their finances were a mess   fully half and probably more we had to switch from the car they initially wanted down to a much cheaper version or try to convert to a lease because it was the only way the bank would loan the money   we called them $ 30,000 millionaires because they did n't make a whole lot but tried to look like they did   as a salesman you knew you were in serious trouble when they did n't even try to negotiate around 2 of the deals i did were actual cash deals meaning honest cash not those who came in with a pre approved loan from a bank   these were invariably for used cars about 3 to 4 years old and they never had a trade in   the people doing this always looked comfortable but never dressed up you would n't even look at them twice   the negotiations were hard because they knew exactly how much that car should go for and would n't even pay that    it was obvious they knew the value of money that said i 've been in the top 3 of wage earners for about 20 years and at no point have i considered myself in a position to afford a new luxury car   imho there are far more important things you can do with that kind of money

all rules have unintended consequences   the more complex the the more difficult it is to predict the outcome   the choice is fundamentally to constantly change the rules and pile rules on top of rules or simplify the rules and make them more permanent    if what the mp was suggesting was tax code simplification in order to reduce the unintended side effects then i would call this smart   however adding extra rules and making the tax code and more difficult to follow i believe makes the intent of the law harder to follow undermining the purpose of creating the new rules

there are two options according to wells fargo you can either apply for a business commercial equity loan or a line of credit a loan is what it sounds like they give you a lump sum of money for you to use and you have to pay it in monthly installments a line of credit is like a credit card you have money that you can borrow up to a certain amount and you have to make monthly payments the process can differ for different business they probably look at what your real estate is worth how much money you are generating from it etc i am not recommending or endorsing wells fargo other major banks offer the same types of products wells fargo just happened to appear first when i searched for business line of credit

those advantages you 've described tax treatment and employee match are what you receive in exchange for locking up the money ultimately it 's a personal choice of whether that tradeoff makes sense for you situation i 'll echo the response that the real answer to your question is planning roth options either 401 k or ira may be good compromises for you since you can withdraw those contributions but not the earnings without any penalty since you 've already paid taxes on them another avenue to explore may be a self directed ira or a solo 401(k depending on your circumstances and eligibility in both cases there are plan providers that structure the plan to allow you to use the money to invest in things besides traditional stocks bonds and mutual funds often referred to as checkbook control accounts they are very commonly used among real estate investors this thread from has quite a bit of info you 'd want to consult with an accountant or financial adviser before going down that path

the $ 3 k includes property tax right it looks like the mortgage alone will be about $ or so if your cal state tax is enough to put you into itemized deductions your mortgage and property tax are a write off and the $ 3k will actually be closer to the $ 2 k you are considering for rent   the wild card as i see it is that your budget is so tight that any unforeseen expenses will be charged as a long time homeowner i know these expenses sometime appear to be high and regular despite their random nature the money earmarked for credit card payments will go a long way to cover the tight budget you seem to have this and your decreasing support makes this look tight but not impossible the condition of the house would make or break the deal in my opinion

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

it starts here   you said you are a high earner but high is relative this tax table will show what marginal rate you have for your taxable income look at your 2015 return to get a better idea what taxable means vs gross income for starters with a standard deduction and just the two of you $ 20 k comes off your gross even so let 's assume you are in the marginal 25 bracket   the w4 form does offer instructions on how to calculate how much extra to withhold but to your point and brilliant criticism of the process withholding is not available as a percent only as normal withholding i.e. if spouse 's income were a flat predictable number or as an extra fixed number per check   you shared with us in your other question she expects to earn $ the average of these 2 numbers is $ 11 k which at 25 is $ i 'd divide that over the number of checks remaining this year 20 and just withhold that much extra use your tax software from last year or an online calculator and in 3 months see if you are on track you can adjust the w4 any time to get as close to the actual total year tax due as you 'd like my answer focuses on the adjust repeatedly part of keshlam 's own answer his quarterly payments suggestion also works and you might prefer it in general mine would only take 1 2 adjustments per year at most   if you withhold too much as most people seem to do you 'll get it back when you file but worst case you withhold $ and she makes just $ 8000 this is $ too much the average refund is over $ 3000 too little and mhoran 's answer explains when you 'd owe a penalty

start with the bank where you have your checking and savings account they can streamline some of the paperwork because they can see how much you make and have access to several years worth of bank statement legitimate mortgage companies do publish their rates but there is no guarantee that you will qualify for the best rate without them knowing your credit score salary and down payment information   there is no way to know that you have the best rate because of the time lag involved you will pick the best one you can work with but the rates can change every day   even when you lock in the rates other companies can drift lower once you have started down the application process you will reach a point where switching companies will cost you time and money once you decide to purchase a house the contract usually only gives you a few weeks to prove that you have financing in place therefore you will have to start the process before deciding on the house some advance work is needed to give you an idea of the maximum monthly payment you can afford which will then based on the rate and down payment determine the maximum house you can buy i have had good luck with my credit union but there is no guarantee that yours will be competitive keep in mind that while rates are very important some people also value customer service and also like that the mortgage wo n't be sold to out of town investors

you have a few options option 1 leave the money where it is if your balance is over $ 5k you should be able to leave the money in your former employer 's 401(k the money will stay there and continue to be invested in the funds that you elect to invest in you should at the very least be receiving quarterly statements for the account even better you should have access to some type of an online account where you can transfer your investments rebalance your account conform to target etc if you do not have online account access than i 'm sure you can still transfer investments and make trades via a paper form just reach out to the 401(k tpa or recordkeeper that administers your plan their contact info is on the quarterly statements you should be receiving option 2 rollover the money into your current employer 's 401(k plan this is the option that i tend to recommend the most roll the money over into your current employer 's 401(k plan this way all the money is in the same place and is invested in the funds that you elect let 's say you wanted to transfer your investments to a new fund lineup right now you have to fill out the paperwork or go through the online process twice for both accounts moving the money to your current employer 's plan and having all the money in the same place eliminates this redundancy and allows you to make one simple transfer of all your assets option 3 roll the money from your former employer 's plan into an ira this is a cool option because now you have a new ira with a new set of dollar limits you can roll the money into a separate ira and contribute an additional $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 if you are 50 + years of age so this is cool because it gives you a chance to save even more for retirement many ira companies give you a sign on bonus where if you rollover your former employers they will give you a bonus typically a few hundred bucks but hey its free money other things to note take a look at your plan document from your former employer 's 401(k plan take a look at the fees compare the fees to your current employer 's plan there could be a chance that the fees from your former employer 's plan are much higher than your current employer so this would just be yet another reason to move the money to your current employer 's plan do n't forget you most likely have a financial advisor that oversees your current employer 's 401(k plan this financial advisor also probably takes fees from your account so use his services you are probably already paying for it talk to your hr at your employer and ask who the investment advisor is call the advisor and set up an appointment to talk about your retirement and financial goals ask him for his advice its always nice talking to someone with experience face to face good luck with everything

yes and no   you can not claim the maid service cleaning your home but you can cleaning your office or your office 's facilities   for example if you have a mother in law suite in the back that you converted to an office and you have a maid service cleaning just that then you should be able to claim the expense another example would be if you have a room in your house set aside as an office careful here and your maid services charges $ 20 per room you should be able to claim that $ 20   another example if you have a maid service that charges you $ 100 to clean your house and you have a dedicated office in that house then you may be   claim a portion of your expenses as a business expense however this can be very subject to your situation for example your much more likely to meet the criteria if you have clients in your office much less likely if your the only person using the office   also you need to be aware that what the irs allows you to call an office is not as clear cut as it seems   your best bet is to ask a tax consultant

whether or not the specific card in question is truly 0 interest rate for the first 12 months such cards do exist however the bank does make money out of it on the average still 12 months of not having to think about paying the bill nice this is exactly what they want you to do then in 12 months when you start thinking about it you may find out that you do n't have the cash immediately available and end up paying the usually very large interest it is possible to game this system to keep the free money in investments for the 12 months as long as you are very careful to always follow the terms and dates because even one can take away the small profits you could get for a 12 month investment of a few thousand dollars it is rarely worth the effort

the old truck is collateral for a loan the place that made the loan expects that if you ca n't pay they can repossess that old truck if you sell it they ca n't repossess it   the dealer needs clean title to be able to buy the truck from you so they can fix up the truck and sell it to somebody else i am assuming the the lender has filed paperwork with the state to show their lien on the title your options are three as to option 2 if the deal still makes sense the new car dealer can send the $ 9,000 to the lender that you forgot about that will of course increase the amount of money you have to borrow   you will also run into the problem that this loan that you forgot to mention on your credit application may cause them to rethink the decision to loan you the money

to expand a bit on 's answer when i read your question title i assumed that by retirement funds you meant target date funds that are close to their target dates say the 2015 target fund   when i saw that you were referring to all target date funds it occurred to me that examining how such funds modify their portfolios over time would actually help answer your question if you look at a near term target fund you can see that a smaller percent is invested internationally the same way a smaller percent is invested in stocks   it 's because of risk   since it 's more likely that you will need some of the money soon and since you 'll be cashing out said money in us dollars it 's risky to have too much invested in foreign currencies   if you need money that 's currently invested in a foreign currency and that currency happens to be doing poorly against usd at the moment then you 'll lose money simply because you need it now this is the same rationale that goes into target date funds moving from stocks to bonds over time   since the value of a stock portfolio has a lot more natural volatility than the value of a bond portfolio if you 're heavily invested in stocks when you need to withdraw money there 's a higher probability that you 'll need to cash out just when stocks happen to be doing relatively poorly   being invested more in bonds around when you 'll need your money is less risky similarly being more invested in us dollars than in foreign currencies around when you 'll need your money is also less risky

the debt is absolutely real china loans money to us via buying the us treasury bonds the bond is essentially a promise to pay back the money with interest just like a loan as you point out the us can print money if this were to happen then the usd that the owner of a treasury bond receives when the bond matures are worth less that than the usd used to purchase the bonds there are lots of reasons why the us does n't want to print lots of money so the purchaser of the bond is probably confident it wo n't happen if for some reason they think it is possible then they will want to cover that risk by only purchasing bonds that have a higher interest rate the higher interest offsets the risk of the usd being worth less of course there are lots more details e.g. the bonds themselves are bought and sold before maturity but this is the basic idea

why must terms must be mutually exclusive   this false dichotomy is what seems to cause the most debate   it is the single event outcome that defines gambling gambling will involve an contract that is the outcome is specifically tied to a single event that determines profit loss this could be the outcome of a race or the roll of a dice but should involve chance   this is why gambling is often in the context of a game but i would make the argument that some investment tools fall into this category the price of a stock at a certain date for example this may also be called betting which opens up a whole other discussion investing has no such implication and as such it is the broader term   investing is to put something money to work to return a profit some forms of gambling could fall under this umbrella some would say that is a bad investment and even if they are right it may still be the desire and intent of the investor to make a profit   not all gambling falls under investing you can gamble for pleasure   the profit loss of most investments are not contractually tied to a specific event or outcome e.g. the price of a stock over 10 years is the result of many events affecting its market value such an investment would not be considered gambling

buyouts are usually for more than the original value of a stock that 's because the price premium represents an incentive for holders to tender their shares to the would be buyer sometimes in these situations the stock price rises above the proposed buyout price in anticipation of a higher takeover bid from a second party that may or may not materialize to answer the other part of the question does a bidder have a chance of taking over a dying company for less than the market price that is a strategy sometimes referred to as a take under and it has not been a notably successful strategy that 's because it goes against human nature of the seller where there is life there is hope they would seldom accept a lower price for sure survival when the market is telling them that they are worth a higher price very few people realize that the market may disappear tomorrow think of all the homeowners who wo n't cut their price but insist on bids that meet recent comps and if the company is really dying the prospective buyer may be best served by waiting until it does and then pick up the individual pieces at auction

as i understand it implied volatility represents the expected gyrations of an options contract over it 's lifetime   no it represents that expected movement of the underlying stock not the option itself   yes the value of the option will move roughly in the same direction the value of the stock but that 's not what iv is measuring i even tried staring at the math behind the options pricing model to see if that could make more sense for me but that did n't help that formula is correct for the black scholes model and it is not possible or at least no one has done it yet to solve for s to create a closed form equation for implied volatility   what most systems do to calculate implied volatility is plug in different values of s standard deviation until a value for the option is found that matches the quoted market value $ in this example   that 's why it 's called implied volatility the value is implied from market prices not calculated directly the thing that sticks out to me is that the last quoted price of $ 12 is outside of the bid ask spread of $ to $ which tells me that the underlying stock has dropped significantly since the last actual trade    if the implied vol is calculated based on the last executed trade then whatever algorithm they used to solve for a volatility that match that price could n't find a solution which then choose to show as a 0 volatility    in reality the volatility is somewhere between the two neighbors of 56 and 97 but with such a short time until expiry there should be very little chance of the stock dropping below $ 27.50 and the value of the option should be somewhere around its intrinsic value strike stock price of $

when there is a difference between the two no trading occurs let 's look at an example investor a b c and d all buy sell shares of company x. investor a wants to sell 10 shares at $ 20 a share ask price $ 20 investor b wants to buy 15 shares at $ 10 a share bid price $ 10 since the bid price and ask price are different no sale is made next investor c comes along and wants to sell 5 shares at $ 14 ask price $ 14 still no sale investor d comes along and wants to buy 5 shares for $ 14 each so a sale is finally made at this point the stock quote moves to $ 14 the ask price is $ 20 and the bid price is $ 10 no further trading will occur until another investor is willing to buy at $ 20 or sell at $ 10   another discussion of this topic is shown on this post

housing eh housing costs are driven by salaries and land availability over in the bay area $ for a nice apartment is a good deal but a decent software engineer with ~4 years experience can get $ 120k easily the standard benchmark of affordability of housing is spending a third of your income on it a year that guy can afford about $ on housing if you do n't away the money and can keep your cost of living down and save money you can really clean up especially if you move elsewhere later so to stop thinking about it in terms of dollar value first try to think of it in terms of time 33 of someone 's salary or a third of their time at work going for housing is pretty nominal beyond that think about it in terms of opportunity cost if you saved that extra $ 20 what exactly would you use it for and how much of that goal does it represent

look for states that have no income tax a lot of these states supplement their revenue with higher property taxes but if you rent and do not own property in the state then you will have no state tax liability similarly many states treat capital gains no differently than income tax so if you make your earnings due to a large nest egg then way you will still incur no tax liability on the state level look for unincorporated areas as these are administrative divisions of states that do not have a municipal government and as such do not collect local taxes look for economic development perks of the new jurisdiction many states have some kind of formal tax credit for people that start business or buy in certain areas but money talks and you can make an individual arrangement with any agency municipality etc if the secretary at city hall does n't know about a prepackaged formal arrangement that is offered to citizens then ask for the development package which generally has a processing fee involved this is something you make up ie what is the processing fee for the development package quote on quote states like maryland and nevada have formalized this process but you are generally paying off the secretary of state for favorable treatment you 'll always be paying off someone

i was going to comment above but i must have 50 reputation to comment this is a question that me and i 've given it some thought in the past morningstar is a good choice for simple well organized financial histories    it has more info available for free than some may realize   enter the ticker symbol and then click either the financials or the key ratios tab and you will get 5 10 years of some key financial stats   a premium subscription is $ 185 per year which is not too outrageous the american association of individual investors provides some good histories and a screener for a $ 29 annual fee allows you to chart a metric like eps going back a long ways and so you can then click the chart in order to get the specific number   that is certainly easier than sorting through financial reports from the sec   a message just popped up to say that i 'm not allowed to provide more than 2 links so my contribution to this topic will end here   you can do a search to find the website   i love stackexchange and usually consult it for coding advice   it just happens to be an odd coincidence that this is my first answer   i might even have added that aside in a comment but again i ca n't comment as of yet it 's problem however that the universe of free financial information is a of good resources that no longer exist   it seems that eventually everyone who provides this information wants to cash in on it   littleadv above says that someone should be paid to organize all this information however think that some basic financial information organized like normal data and hey this is not rocket science but excel 101 should be readily available for free   maybe this is a project that needs to happen   with a mission statement of not selling people out later on the closest thing out there may be quandl ca n't link do a search which provides a lot of charts for free and provides a beautiful and flexible api   but its core us fundamental data provided by costs $ 150 per quarter   so not even a basic eps chart is available there for free with all of the power that corporations have over our society i think they could be this information for us rather than providing it to us in a data dumb format that is the equivalent of printing a sql database as a pdf   a company that is worth hundreds of billions on the stock market and it ca n't be bothered to provide us with a basic excel chart that summarizes its own historical earnings   or with all that the government does to try to help us understand all of these investments they can not simply some basic financial information for us this stuff matters a great deal to our lives and i think that much of it could and should be available for free to all of us rather than mainly to financial professionals and those creating annual reports so i disagree that yet another entity needs to be making money off providing the basic transparency about something as simple as historical earnings thank you for indulging that tangent   i know that se itself on focused answers   a wonderful resource that i greatly appreciate

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

in the theater it 's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat so maximum chances are that in the theater that guy is your potential customer otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater they may charge you less that 's because of a different target audience they would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets so very few customers around will be actually potential customers to maximize their profits they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can i know this is going against the normal price elasticity of demand and supply graph but if the prices are low there will be high demand so if the is more than 1 the supplier should supply as much as they can to maximize profits its all based on the target audience that 's what i think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters

share sales purchases are accounted only on the balance sheet cash flow statement although their effects are seen on the income statement remember the balance sheet is like a snapshot in time of all accrued accounts it 's like looking at a glass of water and noting the level   the cash flow and income statements are like looking at the amount of water actually and imaginary respectively pumped in and out of the glass so when a corporation starts it sells shares to whomever   the amount of cash received is accounted for in the investing section of the cash flow statement under the issuance retirement of stock or the like so when shares are sold it is issuance when a company buys back their shares it 's called retirement as cash inflows and outflows respectively if you had a balance sheet before the shares were sold you 'd see under the equity heading a common stock with a nominal irrelevant par value this is usually something low like $ 0.01 per share used for ease of counting the shares from the dollar amount in the account under the subaccount almost always called common stock   if you looked at the balance sheet after the sale you 'd see the number of shares in a note to the side when shares trade publicly the corporation usually has very little to do with it unless if they are selling or buying new shares under whatever label such as ipo secondary offering share repurchase etc but the corporation 's volume from such activity would still be far below the activity of the third parties shares are trading almost exclusively between third parties these share sales and purchases will only be seen on the income statement under earnings per share eps as eps will rise and fall with stock repurchases and sales assuming income is held constant   while not technically part of the income statement but printed with it the basic weighted average and diluted weighted average number of shares are also printed which are the weighted average over the reporting period of shares actually issued and expected if all promises to issue shares with employee stock options grants were made kept the income statement is the accrual accounts of the operations of the company   it has little detail on investing depreciation appreciation or financing interest expenses preferred dividends

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

the reason comcast i 'll just say comcast when i mean tv providers like comcast dish cox etc bundle channels is because they get to sell advertising on those channels   each channel or group of channels like disney charges comcast for the of broadcasting it   that is abc and hbo and so forth ask comcast for a certain $ $ per year month fortnight etc     comcast then takes really popular channels like hbo and bundles them up with shitty channels like and the oxygen network   comcast then sells advertising based on those   so if you want to advertise to middle aged white women in the mid morning oxygen you have to also pay for advertising on hbo at the same time which drives up the price comcast can ask   the popular channels are essentially loss leaders     in turn however oxygen can say hey you 're making a of money advertising on our channel comcast   pay us more or we pull the channel    this cycle continues and is part of the reason cable tv prices keep going up   some other reasons are over the top greed   for your model to work a single subscription fee would have to replace the income earned from ads and maintain the same price paid to each network   since comcast can no longer force people to pay for oxygen when all they want is hbo the prices for the non popular channels skyrocket as people stop paying for them    the shitty networks are n't willing to take the risk of cutting their revenue streams off and will most certainly write into their agreements with comcast and no streaming    the super popular networks do n't need the extra income and feel like streaming would diminish their brand so they add in similar no streaming clauses

if you want to see a more academic version of this look up weighted average cost of capital wacc    it 's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $ 1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks    one thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans even if you do n't need it you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company the thought process is as it states in the article above that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate    i tried to give an example but i only ended up what it says in the article anyhow look up wacc and you 'll understand the fundamentals

the interest accrues daily based on the amount you owe   the less you owe the less the daily interest accrual   the faster you pay it off the less you pay in the lifetime of the loan   you are losing money if you bank money rather than applying it to the loan immediately   since student loans can not be declared in bankruptcy and interest rates can not be refinanced or are then you should consider your student loan a priority in case your employment income runs into problems

disclosure was at a financial blogger conference i attended last month i had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company also i recognize a number of the names of their financial backers this does n't guarantee anything of course except the people behind the scenes are no the same way prosper and lending club have created a market for personal loans this is a company that offers real estate loans   the too good to be true aspect is what i 'll try to address i 've disclosed in other answers that i have my real estate license earlier this year i sold a house that was financed with a hard money loan not a bank but a group of investors they charged the buyer 10 let me state i represented the seller and when i found out the terms of the loan it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal i felt sick for days after that sale   there are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20 down for 25 the same way there 's a business local to my area that offered a 10 loan is doing something similar but in a crowd sourced way it seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6 24 months the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time i 'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house but have bad timing i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved   as a final side note i recalled the 10 story in a social setting and more than one person responded they 'd have been happy to invest their money at 6 i could have saved the buyer 4 and gotten someone else nearly 6 more than they get on their cash

as the answer above states future inflation mitigates unwise for a longer term mortgage at least in financial only terms   but consider that if you lose your ability to make payments for long enough time anytime during term the lending institution has a right to repossess leaving you with nothing or worse for all the maintenance you 've had to do   you can never know but eleven years into my mortgage i lost enough of my income for just long enough time to have to sell for just enough to pay the remainder of the mortgage and walk away with empty pockets    to help clarify understanding even better contrast the mortgage with the other extreme save up and own from day one   when i did the math a few years ago buying with a 30-year mortgage would cost almost 3 times the real house value in mortgage payments with never the freedom to suspend payments when i might need to   being a freedom loving american i determined to buy a house with cash   don't forget that properties are over priced just because buyers less wise than you are so willing to borrow to buy them so i decided to buy some fixer upper that no bank would lend on   i found such a fixer upper paid cash never have to worry about repossession by a lender can continue to save up for my dream home which i 'll own a lot sooner and will have a nice increase in house value while i fix it up to help get me there and no insurance payments to some insurer who 'll tell me what i ca n't do with my property let the next buyer of your fixed up paid off house pay you the over priced amount they are willing to pay just because they can get that 30-year mortgage and you enjoy the freedom to dream and adjust your budget to the needs of the moment and end up with a house in 30 years 15 more realistically that is 2.5 times more valuable   and keep from fighting with your spouse over finances in the meantime

if you did n't have deposits then the growth rate is simply where is the initial balance is the current balance and t is the number of periods for example suppose you started the account with $ 100,000 in 2000 it 's now 2015 15 years later and the balance is $ 240,000 so the growth is if you 're making regular deposits especially if you 're making deposits of unequal amounts the problem becomes much more complex the easiest thing to do is probably to create a spreadsheet make a column for principle a column for deposit amount and a column for percent growth that period assuming a is principle and b is deposit then the formula for growth c is = copy this formula down the column and excel should automatically adjust the row numbers assuming you put one row for each month you can see the growth or loss month by month you can get a general idea of what your overall growth rate has been by taking the average of the monthly amounts but this would not be a truly accurate measure of your total growth because presumably hopefully you have more money in the later months than the earlier months but it would be a good measure of how your investments are doing

first make sure you understand the objective of an etf   in some cases they may use leverage to get a multiple of the index 's return that is different than 1   some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund 's returns may differ from the index by some measure yes   for example if you were to have a fund that had a 50 and -50 return in back to back periods what would your final return be   answer which if you need to visualize this take $ 1 that then becomes $ 1.50 by going up 50 and then becomes $ .75 by going down 50 in a compounded fashion   this is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way

this stock is the same as any other but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities   you the person will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name   you 'll also owe regular tax if you draw a salary etc   the fact that it may be your company does not change these things the company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it 's nominally exchanging things of equal value say $ 100 in cash for $ 100 in stock   in order to sell stock however you might need to register with the sec depending on how you 're going about finding your investors so keep that in mind

did it show just your address or was your name on it as well    you did n't share how long you 've lived at the address either so it makes me wonder whether a former tenant is the one who filed that paperwork   it 's also possible that someone used your address when making a filing   whether that was deliberate or accidental is hard to discern as is their intent if it was intentional it could be accidental someone picked ca for california when they meant to pick co for colorado or ct for connecticut these things do happen   it ca n't make you feel any better about the situation though you should be able to go online to the california secretary of state 's website here and look up everything filed by the llc with the state   that will show who the founders were and everything else that is a matter of public record on the llc   at the very least you can obtain the registered agent 's name and address for the llc which you can then use to contact them and ask why your address is listed as the llc 's business address once you have that info you can then contact the secretary of state and tell them it is n't you so they can do whatever is necessary to correct this this does n't sound like a difficult matter to clear up but it 's important to do your homework first and gather as much information as you can before you call the state   answering i do n't know wo n't get you very far with them compared to having the best answers you can about where the mistake started i hope this helps good luck

according to both huffington post and investopedia   trying to retire without any savings in the bank can be difficult and    that difficulty is compounded by other factors senior citizens need to    keep in mind as they age like health issues and mobility if saving    money is not possible for you retirement does n’t have to pass you by    there are plenty of government assisted and nonprofit programs that    can help you such as the commodity supplemental food program    medicare senior housing help from housing and urban development and    other resources therefore to answer your questions   is this pretty much the destiny of everyone who can not save for retirement   yes if you do not have help from family or friends then you have a chance of ending up homeless and/or on government assistance   do most people really never retire there are people who really will never retire there are stories in the news about walmart or mcdonald 's cashiers who are in their 80s and 90s working because they need to support themselves however that 's not the case for everyone there 's a greeter at my local costco who is in her 80s and she works because she loves it her career was in consulting and she does n't have a lack of retirement money she just really likes talking to people   what really happens i ca n't answer what really happens because i have never experienced it and do n't know people that do therefore i have to go off of what the two articles have said

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

it is n't always bad there are cases where it works unfortunately these are hard to predict   there is no magic formula if you have x years of experience in profession y that makes it perfect to go into business z. even if y and z are the same unless you have the correct type of experience in z you can quickly get over your head ten   years as a waiter does n't help you to understand the entire restaurant business   in some cases the key to running a successful business is having years of experience running a business in other cases the knowledge has to be domain specific the less complete your knowledge the more and blind spots that will exist in your operation   the weaknesses have to be filled by others in your team but that exposes you to other problems they can let you down without you knowing it   the better approach is to say in a few years i want to own a business what do i need to do to get to that point besides money to buy the business money to run the business and money to survive the early years what knowledge do i need to gain or team members do i need to recruit

i believe that your dilemma comes from not having clearly defined consequences of buying it on one side you want it and you can afford it but on the other side there is nothing solid just some vague dislike of spending money and guilt of buying something useless you 're basically guilt tripping yourself into not buying it and guilt tripping is always bad what you need is clear cut consequence something like i can buy x but then i wo n't get y and z and for that you need a clearly laid out budget just to know how much you can spend money that go into things that are absolutely required money that go into various saving plans etc and after that you 're left with some clear amount that should be spent on making yourself happier making yourself happier is not something you should feel guilty about it 's actually one of purposes of life making yourself happy is only bad if it 's hurting other areas of your life and even that is relative because there is always some extent of degradation you 're willing to accept or you have already accepted there is absolutely no point in saving every single penny you can because that will make you live long and unhappy life and die without enjoying your riches

diversification is one aspect to this question and dr fred touches on its relationship to risk   another aspect is leverage so it again comes down to your appetite for risk   a further factor is that if you are successfully renting out your property someone else is effectively buying that asset for you or at least paying the interest on the mortgage just bear in mind that if you get into a situation where you have 10 properties and the rent on them all falls at the same time as the property market crashes sound familiar then you can be left on the hook for a lot of interest payments and your assets may not cover your liabilities

i do n't have a formula for anything like this but it is important to note that the current value of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it for example let 's consider a house   you can get an appraisal done on your house where your home is inspected and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared   however this value is only theoretical   if you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value the same hold true for collectibles   if i have something rare that i need cash for immediately i can take it to a pawn shop and get cash   however if i take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector i can get more for it this is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation   if the current market value of your shares is $ 10 million but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today you are n't going to get $ 10 million   but if you take your time selling a little at a time you are more likely to get much closer to this $ 10 million number a motivated seller means that the price will drop

i 'd think the first question here is did they overpay you and if so what were the circumstances at one extreme if you lied on your and said you worked 50 hours when really you only worked 40 and they paid you for 50 hours and now they 've figured out that you did n't really work those overtime hours then yes they overpaid you and you owe them the money or if you reported your time accurately but they made an honest mistake like you worked 30 hours but for whatever reason they paid you for 40 then they really did overpay you and you owe them the money or if a check was just mis printed because their computer system screwed up or something sorry you do n't get to keep the money yes we all have fantasies about the bank accidentally adding a million dollars to our balance and somehow we get to keep the money but sorry it does n't work that way in real life if there 's been a mistake once they figure out the mistake you have to give the money back if it 's something more complicated it might be debatable   if you 're not sure what the details are find out the details and investigate do you have any evidence that what they are saying is not true how much money is involved if we 're talking $ 20 it 's not worth going to court over you 'd have to pay a lawyer way more than the $ 20 a court might order the company to pay your court costs if you won but they might not and if you lost you could have to pay their court costs which could be way more than any possible gain there are times when it 's better to just eat the loss and get on with your life of course the same could be said from the other side if the amount of money is small and the case is debatable and you refuse to hand over the cash they may just give up figuring it 's not worth the trouble i do n't know that i 'd want to gamble on that though if there is serious money involved at least several thousand dollars then it could make sense to talk to a lawyer if you think you have a case

the value of getting into the landlord business or any other business depends on circumstances at the time how much will it cost you to buy the property how much can you reasonably expect to collect in rent how easy or difficult is it to find a tenant etc i owned a rental property for about ten years and i lost a bundle of money on it things people often do n't consider when calculating likely rental income are there will be times when you have no tenant someone moves out and you do n't always find a new tenant right away maintenance there 's always something that the tenant expects you to fix tenants are n't likely to take as good a care of the property as someone who owned it would and while a homeowner might fix little things himself like a broken light switch or the tenant expects the landlord to fix such things if you live nearby and have the time and ability to do minor maintenance this may be no big deal if you have to call a professional this can get very expensive very quickly like for example i once had a tenant complain that the water heater was n't working i called a plumber he found that the knob on the water heater was set to low so he turned it up he charged me i think it was $ 200 i ca n't really complain about the charge he had to drive to the property figure out that that was all the problem was turn the knob and then verify that that really solved the problem tenants do n't always pay the rent on time or at all i had several tenants who apparently saw the rent as something optional to be paid if they had money left over that they could n't think of anything better to do with you may get bad tenants who destroy the place i had one tenant who did $ 10,000 worth of damage that include six inches deep of trash all over the house that had to be cleared out rotting food all over on walls holes in the walls and many things broken i thought it was disgusting just to have to go in to clean it up i ca n't imagine living like that but whatever depending on the laws in your area it may be very difficult to kick out a bad tenant in my case i had to evict two tenants and it took about three months each time to go through the legal process on the slip side the big advantage to owning real estate is that once you pay it off you own it and can continue to collect rent and as most currencies in the world are subject to inflation the rent you can charge will normally go up while your mortgage payments are constant

inflation is an attempt to measure how much less money is worth it is a weighted average of some bundle of goods and services price 's increase   money 's value is in what you can exchange it for so higher prices means money is worth less monthly inflation is quoted either as a year ending on that month or since the previous month   as the values differ by more than a factor of 10 you can usually tell which one is being referred to when they say inflation in august was 0.4 a record high or inflation in august was 3.6   you do need some context of the state of the economy and how surprised the people talking about the numbers are   sometimes they refer to inflation since the last month and then annualize it which adds to the confusion consumer inflation 's value depends on what the basket of goods is and what you define as the same good   is a computer this year the same as the last   if the computer is 10x faster do you ignore that or factor it in what basket do you use   the typical monthly consumables purchased by a middle class citizen   by a poor citizen   by a rich citizen   a mixture and if so which mixture more detailed inflation figures can focus on inflation facing each of the population by household income split durable goods from non durable goods from services split wage from non wage inflation ignore volatile things like food and energy etc inflation does n't directly cause prices to raise instead it is a measure of how much raise in prices happened   it can easily be a self as inflation expectations can lead to everyone automatically increasing the price they charge for everything wages goods etc inflation can be viewed as a measurement of the cost of holding cash   at 10 inflation per year holding a million dollars in cash for a year costs you 100,000 $ in buying power   at 1 inflation it costs   at 0.1 inflation inflation of 10 in one year followed by 10 the next adds up to 1.1 1.1 1 = 21 inflation over the two years   for low inflation numbers this acts a lot like adding the further from 0 you get the more the lower order terms make the result larger   1 inflation for two years adds up to 10 over two years 21 100 over two years 300 1000 over two years 12000 etc   and yes some places suffer 1000 inflation

value is one area where economic theories tend to diverge and the very basic schools of thought both have excellent points in their favor you 've identified both here one being that economic value can always be determined by net labor or at least cost of inputs and the other being that economic value does not exist in and of itself and that only a market can determine value in some ways it is just a question of world view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against at the same time without exchange the concept of value has little meaning so as usual it is some mixed with some sense   both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first interestingly though neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical        note that net labor is the sum of all labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

yes you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it you 'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan but it will be better than nothing however you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead i.e. only draw down the money you need when you need it and not start paying interest until that happens that would save you a lot more money note that the isa limit is currently £ and the limit is on total deposits so you wo n't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year since that ends on april 5th that probably wo n't be an issue for you

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

the previous answers have raised very good points but i believe one facet of this has been neglected while it 's true that the total accessible supply of gold keeps rather slowly as was mentioned earlier the fact remains that gold like oil is a non renewable natural resource so at some point we are going to run out of gold to mine due to this fact i believe gold will always be highly valued of course it can certainly always fluctuate in value in fact i expect in the reasonably near future to see a decline in the price of gold due to investors selling it en masse to re enter the stock market when the economy has recovered more substantially

if your intention is to purchase etfs on a regular basis like $ x per month then etfs may not make sense   you may have to pay a fixed transaction cost like you were buying a stock for each purchase   in a similar no load mutual fund there are more likely to be no transaction costs depending on how it is bought    the above paragraph is not very definitive and is really dependent upon how you would purchase either etfs or mutual funds   for example if you have a fidelity brokerage account they may let you buy certain etfs commission free   okay then either etfs make great sense   it would not make sense to buy ones that they charge $ 35 per transaction if you have regular transactions that are smallish the last two questions seem to be asking if you should buy mf or buy stocks directly   for most people the later is a losing proposition   they do not have the time or ability to buy stocks directly effectively   even if they did they may not have the capital to make enough of a difference when one considers all the cost involved   however if that kind of thing interests you perhaps you should dabble   start out small and look at the higher costs of doing so as part of the cost of doing business

your reasoning is backwards as others have pointed out you can not just decide how much you charge irrespective of the market let me paraphrase a little economics 101 to why you also should not think like this you can see a rental property like your house the same reasoning is usually explained with the example of hotel rooms as a series of perishable goods your house represents the potential sale of the january rent which once january is over plus the february rent etc your approach was to compute the total costs all fixed and variable costs of owning that house as well as costs associated to renting specifically and average them over the time period so that you know how much to ask at least assuming that you are only looking to rent it out not sell it or let a family member live there you ca n't think like this most of those costs that you averaged are what economists call sunk costs you have already incurred the mortgage costs and they are not affected by your decision to rent or not to rent these costs are irrelevant to your decision making process you only need to think about marginal costs those additional costs that you have when you rent but not when you do n't look at the market prices for renting similar properties in that region and compare them with your marginal costs as long as they are higher than your marginal costs rent it out this does not mean that you are sure to make profits but it means that you are sure to make less losses than in your only alternative of not renting

there it is the core difference between our perspectives you believe there are innate human needs that can be known objectively and i do not    i believe that human needs are inherently subjective and their degree of satisfaction or lack of satisfaction is unknowable to anyone but that individual   both language and observable behavior offer an incomplete picture of a person 's internal state i think philosophy calls this privileged access

yes the borrower is responsible for paying back the full amount of the loan foreclosure gives the bank possession of the property which they can and do sell any shortfall is still the borrower 's responsibility but no the bank ca n't sell the property for a dollar they have to make a reasonable effort usually the sale is done through a sheriff 's sale that is a more or less carefully supervised auction bankruptcy will wipe out the shortfall and most other debts but the downside is that most of the rest of your assets will also be sold to help pay off what you owe details of what you can keep vary from state to state if you want to go this route hire a lawyer

i personally believe if one average income could support the needs of a family nothing extravagant and the parents had options instead of only one of the parents having the ability to work for an income that supports a family it would be better at the micro view there would be less and more time for family i feel bad now bc i 'm stretched so thin i do n't even have time to watch a tv show with our kids during the week    in our situation my husband never finished school his mom let him drop out in the 7th grade so his work options are very limited he has had to work out of town jobs since before we started dating i graduated high school but due to having kids early i put off college because of the expense of daycare i stayed at home with the kids for about 5 years the plan is i get my degree next fall get a decent paying job to support the family   and he can figure out what he wants to do as a career and be able to pursue it without having the pressure of having to make an income to support a family i have been him to at least get an online high school diploma in the mean time but i think he is self conscious and scared he ca n't do it we are n't the keeping up with the jones kind of people i 'm just trying to reach some goals and be financially stable and not worry about if we have enough money in the bank for bills or if the car breaks down if we are screwed    a teacher 's job is very time consuming so it definitely will be a challenge if you do n't work a job that allows you to help out at my internship this summer the cfo was able to just leave and bring his daughter to work whenever he needed to that luxury is not afforded to many    also on a side when you have kids please make an effort to take your paternity leave if your job offers it you deserve it employees should n't feel bad for taking the benefits their company offers gender equality

as the other answers suggest there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation amount of equity in your current house cashflow primarily amount of time between purchase and sale if you have a fair amount of equity for example $ 50 k mortgage remaining on a house valued at $ 300 k i 'll propose an option that 's similar to bridge financing place an offer on your new house use some of your equity as part of the down payment eg $ 130 k use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale eg $ 30 k the way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage the proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale you 'll be paying two mortgages and you 'll be responsible for two properties not fun but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this when the sale of your new home closes you 'll be breaking the mortgage on that house when you get the proceeds of the sale it would be a good time to use any lump sum prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house   you 'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break however the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing for this reason this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long eg at least 6 months and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable eg 3 months interest you would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer but you would also have to do your own due diligence remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell if you wo n't have any problems selling your current house quickly bridge financing is likely a better deal if you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell you can consider this approach
