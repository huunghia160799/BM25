you say you are underwater by $   does that include the 6 comission that selling will cost you   if you are underwater and have to sell anyway why would you want to give the bank any extra money   a loss will be taken on the sale   personally i would want the bank to take as much of that loss as possible rather than myself   depending on the locale the mortgage may or may not be non recourse ie the loan contract implies that the bank can take the house from you if you default but if non recourse the bank has no legal way to demand more money from you getting the bank to cooperate on a short sale might be massively painful   if you have $ in your savings you might have more leverage to with the bank on how much money you have to give them in the event the loan is not non recourse   note that even if not non recourse it 's not clear it would be worth the banks time and money to pursue any shortfall after a sale or if you just walk away and mail the keys to the bank if you 're not worried about your credit the most financially beneficial action for you might be to simply stop paying the mortgage at all and bank the whole payments   it will take the bank some time to get you out of the house and you can live cost free during that time you may feel a moral obligation to the bank   i would not feel this way   the banks and bankers took a ton of money out of selling mortgages to buyers and then selling securities based on the mortgages to investors   they looted the whole system and pushed prices up greatly in the process which burned most home buyers and home owners   it 's all about business advice is to act like a business does and minimize your costs   the bank should have required a big enough downpayment to cover their risk   if they did not then they are to blame for any loss they incur   this is the most basic rule of finance

i 'd pile up as much cash as you can in a savings account you will need money for the move even if it 's just gas money and it 's going to be hard to predict where house prices are going so you might or might not be underwater when it comes time to sell the house or you might be so deep underwater by then that the extra money does n't make much of a difference anymore anyway once you 're actually in the process of selling the house you can figure out if you can or need to use the savings to cover the shortfall closing costs or if you just built up a little wealth during the time you put the money aside

tl;dr when everything is going great it 's not really a problem it 's when things change that it 's a problem finally home loans are extended over extremely long periods i.e. 15 or 30 years making any fluctuations in their value short lived even less reason to be obsessed over their current value relative to the loan your post is based on the assumption that you never move in that case you are correct being underwater on a mortgage is not a problem the market value of your house matters little except if you sell it or it gets the primary problem arises if you want to sell there are a variety of reasons you might be required to move in all of these scenarios it is a major problem if you can not sell your options generally are in the first option you will destroy your credit this may or may not be a problem the second is a major inconvenience the third is ideal but often people in this situation have money related problems student loans can deferred if needed mortgages can not a car is more likely to be a lower payment as well as a lower amount underwater generally the problem comes when people buy a mortgage assuming certain things whether that 's appreciation income stability growth etc when these change they run into these problems and that is exactly a moment where being underwater is a problem

us treasury securities are the safest investment you can buy short term by buying t bills   you buy t bills at a discount to face for example to buy a four week t bill the treasury will take $ out of your account in four weeks the treasury will deposit $ 100 into your account the $ 0.02 difference is your intrest on the loan compounded over a year 13 four week periods you get a interest but presumably more importantly to you you get your original $ back   your government can not nationalize money that you have on loan to the united states government   edit oops i dropped a decimal position in my original calculation of compounded rate of interest it is now corrected

wikipedia has a detailed article explaining this a standard commercial letter of credit lc is a document issued mostly by a financial institution used primarily in trade finance which usually provides an irrevocable payment undertaking so yes they are primarily for use by businesses if you will read the article stating the terms and conditions for payment and shipment you will realize that such model wo n't be of much value to and will create many hurdles for a typical consumer yes you can cash a letter of credit but only once the conditions in the letter have been met e.g. delivery shipment of goods services an array of documents need to be presented as well whether it is easy or not is a very subjective question   a bank will issue a letter of credit only when it is reasonably sure that its risk is covered backed by a bank deposit or by conditions in the letter itself obviously derivatives on these letters have evolved as well

so you do n't have to look at silly for 50 of the article    is a physical penetration tester and information security consultant she specializes in social engineering security assessments including physical voice and text phishing she in remediation and prevention of security incidents through creation of policy and procedures as well as customized training for your individual office culture prior to working in was a journalist photographer and a mom   hello my name is and i break into buildings i get paid to think like a criminal   organizations hire me to evaluate their security which i do by seeing if i can bypass it during tests i get to do some climb over walls or hop wire fences i get to go diving and play with all sorts of cool gadgets that q would be proud of   but usually i use what is called social engineering to convince the employees to let me in sometimes i use email or phone calls to pretend to be someone i am not most often i get to approach people in person and give them the confidence to let me in   my frequently asked questions include what break in are you most proud of   what have you done for a test that you were the most ashamed of   what follows is the answer to both of these questions   a few months ago a client had hired me to test two of their facilities a manufacturing plant plus data center and office building nearby   first step open source intelligence or i look at maps satellite images study what i can of their delivery and supply schedules and so on   the manufacturing facility looked like a prison no windows heavy iron gates no landscaping generally a of architecture   this facility had armed guards badge readers security controls and at every entrance   i remember thinking it 's got to be hell to work in there i wonder if i can use that    one thing was for sure the chances of following behind an employee with valid credentials into this building were next to non existent   i was going to have to get down and dirty with my social engineering   first stop linkedin your linkedin is my best friend the more information you have on your linkedin the more options i have   i have several fake linkedin profiles that you are probably connected to    i profiles of employees who work at these facilities and cross reference them to other social media sites and i find a lovely young woman who i 'm going to call mary   mary was a brand new hire working as an assistant at the manufacturing facility mary had a public facebook account too   on mary 's public facebook account she documented all of her family 's adventures   side note now i know where mary went to high school her mother 's name the names of her pets etc   answers to those security questions you use to reset your passwords are very easy to find if you are n't careful with that information    not to mention that now i know where mary works where her kids go to school where they vacation i could go on scary stuff   this is not an advanced investigation i 'm not a private investigator and i do n't have the resources of the nsa but i can do a lot of damage with simple methods   most notably to me there were photos mary posted of her time volunteering with a certain maternity support center   her passion for children and caring new moms was very plain so of course i took advantage of it    for this assessment i played two roles for the first i my phone number to make it look like it was coming from the company 's headquarters   i called the front desk of the manufacturing facility and was transferred to mary hi mary i said my name is barbara   i am a project coordinator with facilities management we are renovating a few of our facilities we are sending an interior designer out to you tomorrow so she can put together proposals to update your space    mary replied well that 's great but why the short notice i could feel her getting suspicious so i pulled out my trump card   sigh well mary you really should have heard from me sooner i 've just been so overloaded at work i feel like i ca n't catch up and to top it off the baby is due in 6 weeks if my boss finds out i messed this up he 's going to flip   i was really getting into this voice shaking yes i know i 'm a terrible human being   she cut me off oh it 's ok we will work this out tell me about the baby is it your first boy or girl   our mary was committed at this point not because she is stupid but because she is a good person she wanted to help me   we talked babies and birth plans for a while never pick a you ca n't speak about at length   mary took down the name of the designer who was coming by the next day and we said our mary could have saved her company a lot of by simply verifying that i was who i claimed to be just to be clear here i would never give out mary 's real identity i 'm not totally heartless this could have happened to anyone she has not been fired   i showed up the next day as with a fictional architecture firm that i had made business cards and a website for my alter ego had done most of the leg work for me when i arrived mary and her boss were waiting for me with smiles i shook hands all around and handed them the business card i printed out the night before i was given a visitor badge and the red carpet was rolled out   i gained rapport with the staff there by asking them to tell me what they wanted in an office space they were so excited i might have claimed to be on the team that put together the google offices i am horrible this is my inner child   you want a standing desk new chairs over here ergonomic keyboards for everyone let 's look at   we became best buds i was given complete and access to the facility where i stayed for several hours   i gained network access and stole several thousands of dollars in physical by picking my way through cheap locks credit to for the    this client had been pretty confident that i would n't get into either facility much less be able to hit both in a short time span so the timeline was left to my discretion but it was assumed that i would need to fly to the area twice   i did n't see the need in them with two round trip expenses    i went back to mary 's office and said well i think i have what i need from here how do i get to the office center   she looked at her watch and said it 's almost lunch time i 'll take you there a whole group of us piled into the parking lot and they took me to a nearby taco shop that 's right my marks took me to get tacos i love my job   after lunch they drove me to the offices and a few of them came in with me to show me around   i took forever looking around this office space and eventually they said their because they had to go back to work they had a strict policy of visitors but i had been seen walking around with trusted insiders so no one questioned me   i was free to take my time i made myself at home my main objective at this site was to weasel my way into private corner offices   when i accomplished my goals i tracked down my point of contact 's office this is the man who hired me in the first place this is the best part of every job    steve was there hard at work when i disturbed his by knocking on the door he glanced up hi there can i help you   i hi steve i 'm from sincerely security it 's nice to meet you in person   i will never forget the look on his face pure gold who wait what how how did you get in here    we stayed in his office and talked for a long time i went over exactly the steps that could have prevented my success first of all the desire to help others is human and natural we do n't want to discourage that   second i 'm sure they did have some sort of policy that required visitors to check in showing government issued identification but they were n't following it   we also need to post by every computer phone and door trust but verify   an employee who does their homework can ruin my day   third if it seems too good to be true it probably is    is your company going to hire the team who designed google 's offices magic 8 ball says no   lastly the team who took me to the second location should have found someone else to escort me through the building   i 've been doing this job for a couple years now and almost every job is a variant of this story very rarely do i go through an entire assessment without some sort of social engineering   there are ways to protect yourself and your company from attacks like this i think it starts by sharing stories like these and educating and empowering each other to be vigilant

recently i asked about what the company valuation is and how many    shares does my 4 represent cfo told me that there is no point to talk    about shares or stock since the company is not public is it    right no it is wrong shares and stocks exist regardless of how they can be traded once a company is formed there are stocks that belong to the owners in the proportion of the ownership they may not exist physically but they do exist on paper as an owner of 5 of the company you own 5 of the company stocks i asked if my investor portion equity will be subjected under a    vesting schedule cfo said yes that does n't make sense to me because    i bought those 4 are n't those supposed to be fully vested i agree    to my employee equity to be vested does n't make sense to me either since your money is already in their pocket but i 'm not sure if its illegal if that 's what is written in the signed contract then may be its possible to have that situation but it does n't make much sense because these shares are granted to you in return to your money not some potential future work as the 1 employee 's portion you already gave the money so why would n't they be vested best to read the contract upon which you gave them your money i really hope you have at least that and not just gave them a check

the stock market 's principal justification is matching investors with investment opportunities   that 's only reasonably feasible with long term investments   high frequency traders are not interested in investments they are interested in buying cheap and selling expensive   holding reasonably robust shares for longer binds their capital which is one reason the faster paced business of dealing with options is popular instead   so their main manner of operation is off actually investments by letting the investors pay more than the recipients of the investments receive by now the majority of stock market business is indirect and tries guessing where the money goes rather than where the business goes for one thing this leads to the stock market 's evaluations being largely inflated over the actual underlying committed deals happening   and as the commitment to an investment becomes rare the market becomes more volatile and it 's money running in circles fast trading is about running in front of where the money goes anticipating the market   but if there is no actual market to anticipate only people running before the imagination of other people running before money the net payout to zero as the ratio of serious actual investments in tangible targets declines by and large high frequency trading to a ponzi scheme and you try being among the winners of such a scheme   but there are a whole lot of people competing here and essentially the net payoff is close to zero due to the large volumes in circulation as opposed to what ends up in actual tangible investments it 's a completely different game with different rules riding on the original idea of a stock market   so you have to figure out what your money should be doing according to your plans

your initial premise mid cap and small cap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct they have over many 40 yr periods provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds the important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously   imagine this scenario you decide to stick to small mid caps for 10 15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40 's you would have lost a of return as those were periods were small underperformed the market as a whole and large caps in particular as an example from 1946 to large caps outperformed small every single year if 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend you 've done yourself a major disservice   since the dot com crash small have outperformed for sure pretty much every year but that does n't mean that they will continue to do so the reason asset allocation exists is precisely this over a 40 yr period no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio   if you attempt to time the market even if you do so with a multi decade time horizon in mind there a good chance that you will do more poorly

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

a stock buy back reduces the number of stocks available on the open market   since stocks are literally a share in ownership a buy back of the stock then when the company repurchases it has the effect of increasing the percent of ownership of the company of each stock zynga has a market cap of m so a 200 m buy back will increase the ownership value of each stock by ~12   this has had the effect of an immediate stock price bump of around 12 which is to be expected as the value becomes the expected post buyback value however long term gains will require zynga to turn around their business   this bump will only be sustainable if they can   if their business continues to decline then its stock price will continue to slide   there are some who would rather see zynga invest that 200 m in getting a new product to market to bring revenues up rather than spending precious capital on a plan to temporarily bump a stock that is headed towards the floor   if on the other hand the revenue is poised to recover and the company has the excess capitol buying back stock low is a great way to get the most back for your shareholders bucks can they repurchase at any price and any time they can write a buy order for any price at any time in the future though they have some restrictions from the sec mostly involving disclosures   but it is up to the sellers to choose to sell at that price   if they execute the buy back at a rate comparable to market rate then they are more likely to get takers than if they attempt to buy it back at a significant reduction from market price   so since 25 2012 the it is selling for   a buy order for 2.30 is going to get more action than one at 2.00   investors will often look at the companies buy back offer for a company in zynga has been as the true value of the company   if so then a lowball buyback offer could add downward pressure on the stock price

when the index is altered to include new players exclude old ones the fund also adjusts the largest and i would say most important index funds are whole market funds like all world ex us or vt total world stock or all japan   and similarly for bonds reits etc   so companies do n't leave or enter these indexes very often and when they do by an initial offering or bankruptcy it is often at a pretty small value some older indices like the djia are a bit more arbitrary but these are generally not things that index funds would try to match more narrow sector or country indices can have more of this effect and i believe some investors have made a living from index arbitrage   however well run index funds do n't need to just blindly play along with this you need to remember that an index fund does n't need to hold precisely every company in the index they just need to sample such that they will perform very similarly to the index   the largest company in the s&p 500 is not likely to have all that much of an effect on the overall performance of the index and it 's likely to be fairly correlated to other companies in similar sectors which are also covered by the index   so if there is a bit of churn around the bottom of the index it does n't necessarily mean the fund needs to be buying and selling on each transition   if i recall correctly it 's been shown that holding about 250 stocks gives you a very good match with the entire us stock market

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

why do these fees exist from a banks point of view they are operating in currency a currency b is a commodity similar to oil grains goods etc so they will only buy if they can sell it at a margin   currency conversion have inherent risks on small amount the bank generally does not hedge these risks as it is expensive but balances the position end of day or if the exposure becomes large the rate they may get then may be different and the margin covers it hence on highly traded currency pairs the spread is less   are there back end processes and requirements that require financial institutions to pass off the loss to consumers as a fee the processes are to ensure bank does not make loss is it just to make money on the convenience of international transactions banks do make money on such transactions however they also take some risks the forex market is not single market but is a collective hybrid market place there are costs a bank incurs to carry and square off positions and some of it is reflected in fees   if you see some of the remittance banks have optimized a remittance service say usd to inr there is a huge flow often in small amounts the remittance service aggregates such amounts to make it a large amount to get a better deal for themselves and passes on the benefits to individuals such volume of scale is not available for other pairs

simply because forex brokers earn money from the spread that they offer you spread is the difference between buyers and sellers if the buy price is at and the sell price is at then the spread is 2 pips now think that this broker is getting spread from its liquidity cheaper for example 1 pip spread as you can understand this broker makes a profit of 1 pip for each trade you place now multiply 1 pip x huge volume and then you will understand why most forex brokers do n't charge commissions

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

i am not interested in watching stock exchange rates all day long i just want to place it somewhere and let it grow your intuition is spot on to buy hold is the sensible thing to do   there is no need to constantly monitor the stock market to invest successfully you only need some basic pointers people make it look like it 's more complicated than it actually is for individual investors you might find useful some wisdom i wish i had learned even earlier   stocks bonds are the best passive investment available stocks offer the best return while bonds are reduce risk the stock bond allocation depends of your risk tolerance since you 're as young as it gets i would forget about bonds until later and go with a full stock portfolio banks are glorified money the interest you can get from them is rarely noticeable index investing is the best alternative how so because you ca n't beat the market nobody can but people like to try and fail   so instead of trying some fund managers simply track a market index always successfully while others try to beat it consistently failing actively managed mutual funds have higher costs for the extra work involved avoid them like the plague   look for a diversified index fund with low ter total expense ratio these are the most important factors diversification will increase safety while low costs guarantee that you get the most out of your money vanguard has truly good index funds as well as blackrock ishares   since you ca n't simply buy equity by yourself you need a broker to buy and sell luckily there are many good online brokers in europe what we 're looking for in a broker is safety run background checks ask other   wise individual investors that have taken time out of their schedules to read the small print and that charges us with low fees you probably can do this through the bank but well it defeats its own purpose   us citizens have their 401(k accounts very neat stuff check your country 's law to see if you can make use of something similar to reduce the tax cost of investing your government will want a slice of those juicy dividends an alternative is to buy an index fund on which dividends are not distributed but are automatically reinvested instead   some links for further reference   investment 101 and why index investment rocks however the author is based in the us so you might find the next link useful   investment for europeans very useful to check specific information regarding european investing portfolio ideas you 'll realise you do n't actually need many equities since the diversification is built in the index funds   i hope this helps there 's not much more but it 's all condensed in a handful of blogs

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars because people renting these cars often them many of those are also written by unqualified individuals for publication on blog farms and encourage all sorts of financial practices that 's not even considering the interests of who is paying to advertise on said i 'm sure their interests align with making sure you always pay top dollar for a new car because those used ones are so mistreated never trust financial advice published on the internet or in the media for that matter edit one caveat on further never never buy used vehicles from government auctions asset old police cars etc anybody irresponsible enough to go to jail or abandon their car long enough to lose their assets likely is n't a responsible owner of such and cops and crooks alike do absolutely beat the out of police cars   when it comes to government owned vehicles police cars municipal governments are notoriously stingy and will squeeze every last minute of use out of them before putting them on the market if you 're buying a government vehicle assume it 's being sold because it has problems but from a financial point of view i notice that rental agencies sell cars within the first two years during the time when they depreciate the most bingo i figure many large rental companies will have mathematicians who calculate the best time to sell does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser it does n't take a phd to realize it 's bad for business if your model revolves around renting out 1970s that run the risk of breaking down and leaving customers stranded in inopportune or dangerous places in particular has a terrible reputation for this and it shows in the condition of their of the 90s all of them uber wo n't let you drive for them if your car is older than 7 10 years for the same reasons yes as a car ages the chance of having to make repairs increases rental agencies are in the business of renting vehicles not running service centers and garages it 's more aligned with their core business model to just dispose of cars once they 've squeezed the most reliable years out of them and amortize the vehicles depreciation across the tax deductions and fleet pricing they enjoy when buying new ones   this gets them out of the service game and lets them focus on their core procurement and rental there 's no calculated time to lemon that they 're trying to skirt here they 're just trying to avoid having to make any repairs whatsoever

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt

if you have enough money to buy a car in full that probably means you have good credit if you have good credit car dealerships will often offer 0 loans for either a small period of time like 12 months or the entire loan taking a 0 loan is obviously more optimal than paying the entire lump sum up front you can take the money and invest in other things that earn you more than 0 however most dealerships offer a rebate or a 0 loan some commenters below claim that the rebate is usually larger than the saved interest so definitely do the math if you have that option

it has to do with return i do n't know if canada has a matching feature on retirement accounts but in the us many companies will match the first x% you put in so for me my first $ 5000 or so is matched 100 i 'll take that match over paying down any debt beyond that of course it 's a simple matter of rate of return why save in the bank at 2 when you owe at 10 18   one can make this as simple or convoluted as they like my mortgage is a tax deduction so my 5 mortgage costs me 3.6 i 've continued to invest rather than pay the mortgage too early as my retirement account is with pre tax dollars so $ 72 will put $ 100 in that account even in this last decade bad as it was i got more than 3.6 return

the roth traditional decision is complex but can be broken down into a set of simple rules   ideally you want to choose to tax your money at the lowest possible rate this specifically refers to your marginal rate the rate you last $ 100 was taxed or next $ 100 of income with be taxed that in itself is another issue answered with questions here discussing marginal rates   my suggestion has been that if you are in the 15 bracket use roth and continue to do so until you hit 25 at that point begin to shift to the traditional pre tax 401(k or ira my article the 15 solution goes into detail on this although it references the 2013 tax rates i need to re edit if you are already in the 25 bracket i 'd suggest just going pre tax given the ability to convert it 's not as if there are 2 points in time deposit and withdrawal but you can decide every year if your situation changes it 's not uncommon to get married have a baby buy a house and find you just dropped back down to 15 marginal rate when you were solidly 25 prior   let me explain why you should go 100 pretax if already at 25   a single person hits the top of the 15 bracket in 2017 at $ taxable add the standard deduction and exemption and you are at $ the tax on this is $ less than 10 average despite the next $ 100 being taxed at 25 it would take over $ 1 m to have an account large enough to withdraw $ 40k yr   if you blow through that number you hit 25 i agree but why pay 25 now for sure to avoid maybe hitting 25 later you have decades of opportunities for conversion and even more when the funds are transferred to iras if you have a job change and the conversion discussion has multiple layers when the ira is involved say you are too successful you are hitting $ 2 m before age 55 if you retire you can withdraw from the 401(k penalty free but you have 15 years before you 'd start to take ss benefits 15 years to use conversions even if pushing into 25 to reduce the impact of ss taxation   my advice is not a set and forget solution it 's an annual evaluation of the plan for the coming year   further notes on my choice of 15 solution this is the 2017 tax table for singles   i note that median individual income is k which puts that median single at ~20 k taxable this is where the analysis begins this earner might have upward mobility to reach the 25 bracket and begin to save pre tax the goal would be to have a mix of pre post tax money so that over the course of their life the 25 bracket was avoided perhaps completely   in general my writing tend towards the second highest quintile the 60 80 slice of the population the numbers might appear arbitrary but in the end the discussion has to start someplace the concept i described here is best implemented by the single or couple who is still at 15 but soon pushing higher than the line this enables them to start by saving in the roth and slowly shifting towards pre tax the final mix at retirement depends on that timing as well as their opportunities for conversions along the way   part of my focus on that line is that the differential is greatest in bracket shifts between 15 and 25 much of the benefit in the whole discussion is in that shift depositing at 25 yet withdrawing at 15 the 28 couple might wish to avoid the 33 bracket at retirement but that level of income impacts far fewer people and fewer still that are either reading these boards or my other writing

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

do you work in this field or something you sound like a very passionate apologist    gt;why should n't traders be able to decide as a group what the companies are worth   because often they purposefully distort value so they can either a buy low and profit or b sell high and profit why are you so anti government i 'd rather have people i elected and who are accountable to me determining things instead of private and highly selfish interests who represent only themselves    gt do you really think that intraday or even prices are really representative of what the market thinks a company is valued at   if not why bother with the in the first place what is the point of wild price fluctuations even throughout a single day if they as you admit do not represent value the whole concept of short term profiting off of these pointless and often engineered market movements is silly and adds nothing to society whatsoever the original point of the stock market further that money needs to come from somewhere and that typically is long term investors who want a pension at some point and do n't feel like trading at timeframes because they do something useful instead its disgusting   to the effect of long term buy and holders changing their mind about a company the effect of any hft people on the valuation of a stock is practically nothing like i said there 's just about no evidence of speculators causing significant mispricing over any significant period   so you 're saying just because the aggregate effect is no one should worry about it that is the absolute thing i have ever heard if i steel a car every other week who cares right millions of cars are made every year the effect of me stealing 20 or 30 wo nt change car markets in any noticeable way    further speculation in commodities mainly food has indeed caused enormous mispricing and human suffering in the developing world

none of what i say is advice directed to you it is how i would continue to analyse the situation you have were it mine first off i prefer to work in more than possibilities   saying that paying down the mortgage makes sense as i can calculate the amount i will save i also believe that rate rises are coming in the future based on the talk from the so any money i pay off now means guaranteed less interest to pay in the future also the lower my loan to value ratio the better lower interest rates i can receive in the mortgage market if i do not want to work until retirement age it 'd be nice to have as few bills as possible in the decade or so prior to retirement age i could then do early retirement or part time work in the run up to retirement i could use my savings to fund life until retirement pays out i 'd be aiming to put 15 of my gross income into future investing using isas to build up a savings pot taking advantage of retirement products that way all the money is not tied to a normal retirement age before it can accessed and it 's not by future greedy government taxation any income leftover above the 15 i 'd be throwing at the mortgage taking advantage of the 10 overpay window remortgaging as ltv comes down in theory overpaid mortgage equity is money that could still be accessed provided house prices do n't decline and remortgaging is a possibility so in short i 'd follow a plan along these lines of logic 1 make sure i have 4 6 months of living expenses as a rainy day fund insulate myself from fluctuations in my financial situation 2 put away 15 of annual gross income towards future saving isas first pension second 3 overpay the mortgage and look to remortgage as ltv drops when ltv 60 look to lock in to a longer term fix eg 2 year fixes at 90 ltv 5 year fixes at 60 4 reassess steps 2 3 as life happens circumstances change work fluctuates etc 5 once the mortgage is paid off build as much wealth as possible isas first then non tax efficient savings products aim for keeping expenses down and raising my savings rate as much as possible your analysis was thorough and shows you are thinking through consequences never forget to factor in the risk of carrying debt having no low debt as you get older means there 's more income left to build wealth ignore the american view of carrying debt for life and trusting investments to outperform the debt you have to pay monthly to keep that debt around and it ai n't a pet

everything in life is a combination of luck and skill   startups are no different   the risks are higher and most sensible people know and understand that   you know why we worship the successes   because against all odds those startups stood up to your salaried buddies who work for large corporations and have tons of people and kicked their asses   at some point they deserve it   you see startups as gambling others see it as betting on yourself   especially founding or joining an early stage startup   it 's also taking on huge responsibility   in a mega corp your failures and shortcomings will be covered and almost certainly wo n't tank the company   your creativity probably wo n't flourish and their is an incentive to do just well enough   why should you work your ass off for a company that you 're not invested in other than a paycheck   startups are n't for everyone   hell startups probably are n't for most people   but there are some people those select few who simply ca n't imagine not working for themselves creating things tinkering trying to change the world   it 's not even gambling to them it 's a way of life

if your stock is rising and you want to buy on a dip the best way to do this is by looking at the chart and incorporating simple technical analysis techniques firstly an uptrend is defined as a price chart with higher highs and higher lowers if you get a lower high or a lower low or both it could be the end of the uptrend be cautious this can be seen on the chart below with an uptrend line drawn   if you draw a trend line you can wait for the price to approach the trend line bounce off it and start moving up again to buy your stock on a dip if instead the price closes below the trend line be very cautious this could be the end of the uptrend and the start of a downtrend no telling how low the price will go if this is the case you can then draw a downtrend line and wait for the price to close above the downtrend line before making your purchase

i would n't pay down your mortgage faster until you have a huge emergency fund   like two years worth of expenses   once you put extra money toward principal you ca n't get it out unless you get a heloc which costs money   you 're in a position now to build that up in a hurry   i suggest you do so your mortgage is excellent   in the land of inflation it gets easier and easier to make that fixed dollar payment depreciating dollars you seem like a go   once you have your huge emergency fund why not buy a few websites and monetize the heck out of them   or look for an investment property from someone who needs to sell desperately get a cushion that you can do something with

all this is completely true but i was going for a more basic level theoretical   in this case yes one person not paying of their loans would not hurt anything except the person in question as you point out but if people not paying of their loans is bad as it would rob money from the system basically $ 0 of the $ 30 would come back or at least so little that the banks stopped loaning   while the government can inject money that could only go so far   really i was just trying to explain why not paying off loans was bad for the economy even though staying in sustainable debt is good for the economy but not necessarily the individual   thanks for the info though

i 've found that the most effective way to get things done is to communicate directly in person or over the phone if the former is not possible then to follow up with an immediate email per our conversation etc   this allows the natural conversations to occur connecting you with you team members and direct reports while also holding everyone accountable in writing   accountability is n't about being able to say i told you so nor is it about waiting for an opportunity to make someone look bad accountability is about ensuring that no one falls behind or lets the team down in the first place through preventative measures   this comes back full circle to my point on communication the most effective method of management in my experience is simply leading by example when you lead by example you never need to threaten employees with discipline or accountability you simply do what you do and if people respect you for the way you work they will look up to you as a role model your team members will do everything they can to support the team 's objectives on their own accord   source i learned this through a former manager he motivated me to be more committed to the team 's objectives and now i get to pay that forward to my direct reports   edit typos on mobile

there is actually a restriction on how high a wage they can pay you there did n't use to be but now it has to be reasonable for the work you are doing so they ca n't pay you $ 100/hr while other people doing the same work get minimum wage you might ask why on earth a parent would want to pay a child way more than they 're worth the salary is tax deductible to the company then the child pays their expenses hockey fees and equipment field trips birthday presents for their friends and so on out of the money the company paid them   they also save for their post secondary education the rest of the family budget now has a little more room and the parents can lower their own salaries if they have expensive children this means more net money in the company and less total income tax paid by the family for the same total income my concern is that if your parents do n't know whether or not you must be paid minimum wage you must there 's no family exemption then they also do n't know whether you should have ei deducted probably not and various other special cases like eligibility for summer student subsidies the firm 's accountant should be able to help with these things and the company should know all this it 's not the role of a 14 year old to ask the internet how to run a business the business owners should know it

there 's many concrete answers but there 's something circular about your question the only thing i can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but i am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases so now the situation is flipped you are relying on your phone company 's credit   who is to say they do n't just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full    the amount of credit in this situation is you just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit because you have no credit it does n't matter how much money you have $ 10 or $ 10000 can be out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front you also ca n't use that money month by month now even in low risk investments although they will do exactly that and keep the interest and i challenge your assumption that you will never default you are not a being you live on planet earth ever had to pay $ 125,000 for a treatment because you got a rare form of cancer well you wo n't be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone i know you asked a simpler question but i ca n't write a good answer without pointing out that no default is a bad model it 's like doing math without a zero element by the way this is realistic it applies to renting in say new york city it 's better to be a tenant with credit who can withhold rent in issue of neglected maintenance or gross unfair treatment than a tenant who has already paid full rent and has left the landlord with little market incentive to do their part

there are many tactics you can use   if your biggest problem is regretting your larger purchases i 'd suggest giving yourself rules before making any purchases over a certain minimum dollar amount that you set for yourself   for example if that amount is $ 50 for an item then any item starting at an average price of $ 51 would be subject to these rules one of your long term goals ought to be to become the kind of person who finds joy in saving money rather than spending it   make friends with frugal people look for those who prefer games nights and to nights out at the club buying expensive drinks and dinners at the newest steak joint in town   learn the thrill of a deal but even more learn the thrill of your savings growing   you do n't want to enjoy money in the bank for the purposes of becoming a miser   instead you want to realize that money in the bank helps you achieve your goals   buying the house you want donating a significant amount of money to a cause you support allowing you to take a dream vacation letting you buy with cash the car you always wanted the possibilities are endless   as dave ramsey says live like no one else so you can live like no one else

it may depend on the rental agreement you signed some agreements may include clauses that allow for early termination so check your agreement carefully where there is an early termination clause included it will usually have some sort of notice period or financial penalty associated with it   for example you may have to give a couple of months notice and pay rent up to the end of that period or be able to pay some sort of one off penalty as a more practical example i broke a us rental agreement early last autumn and had two early termination options in my rental agreement in my case we chose the second option since we were actually moving out of the country and it was easier to have our us finances completely settled i 'm now planning on breaking another agreement because i 'm in the process of purchasing a property and the purchase will likely go through before the lease expires   in this case the early termination clause requires 2 months notice i.e. we will have to give 2 months notice and pay rent for those two months unless we are less than 2 months from the end of the lease as points out you should also check the laws for the jurisdiction your rental agreement is in to understand what your rights and options are if your agreement does not have an early termination clause

i just graduated from college and i am already planning my retirement    in terms of money sitting in my bank account post retirement assuming ii have    $ 250,000 what is the highest interest that i can earn with it   assuming you are 22 and will retire in 45 years at age 67 there is no way to predict interest rates when i was 22 and just out of college i started putting money into a bank account to save for a down payment the rate for a savings account was 6 that means that every month i made 1/2 of one percent today that same credit union offers a money maker account with a minimum balance of $ 100,000 that pays 0.25 for the year what i made in a month would take two years to make today keep in mind we also ca n't estimate your pay in the last year before retirement or the inflation rate for the next 45 years or the mortgage rate or the availability of social security or the returns of the s&p for 45 years it is great you are starting to think about this today but you will have to keep adjusting parts of your plan as the years go by you may have to factor in children your medical situation   even if the interest rates recover you may not want to put all your post retirement money in the bank most people ca n't sustain the required flow of money for their 30 years of retirement from savings accounts   as for today fdic or similar accounts from credit unions will not have rates approaching 3 it ca n't even approach that 3 rate via multi year cds my credit union has a 6 year cd for almost 2 if the goal of the money is safety then do n't expect to find those high rates now some institutions may offer high rates without that fdic protection but that is risky

the us withholding tax applies to stocks etfs purchased on the nyse and other us based exchanges if you buy on the tse then you will not be charged this tax   your last sentence seems like you might be misunderstanding this tax though if the tax applied it would not cost you 15 on all your profits it only applies to dividend yields so if it pays you a 5 dividend the tax costs you 0.75 however if you buy at $ and sell at $ 26 then your capital gain is not subject to withholding taxes it is however subject to canadian income tax at 50 of the gain amount when it 's not sheltered in a tfsa or other registered account the tax on the gains could easily amount to 16 of your profits which is a much more significant cost therefore having to pay a 0.75 withholding cost certainly does not defeat the purpose of the tfsa which is to shelter from canadian income tax

at this time there is one advantage of having a 30 year loan right now over a 15 year loan   the down side is you will be paying 1 higher interest rate so the question is can you beat 1 on the money you save every month so lets say instead of going with 15 year mortgage i get a 30 and put the $ 200 monthly difference in lets say the dia fund   will i make more on that money than the interest i am losing   my answer is probably yes   plus lets factor in inflation   if we have any high inflation for a few years in the middle of that 30 not only with the true value of what you owe go down but the interest you can make in the bank could be higher than the 4 you are paying for your 30 year loan    just a risk reward thing i think more people should consider

rich people use debt for various reasons the question should not assume that billionaires do n't use debt they also pay lower interest rates on that debt because they have enough collateral that their debt is safer than a typical mortgage many rich people will use interest only mortgages on their primary residences so that they can keep their stock earning at higher growth rates than the mortgage interest that they are paying all while writing off a portion of that mortgage interest on their taxes   taking an artificially low salary and receiving equity for the larger portion of compensation is also a tax strategy to limit the amount of taxes owed on that income if paid directly in stock grants that will count as income but if paid in options then the purchased stock will only be taxed at the lower capital gains rates if the stock is held for a year after the options are exercised every billionaire will have complicated tax avoidance strategies that will require multi year planning for the best long term of taxes debt is a strategic part of that planning also consider that a major part of that upscale lifestyle corporate jets fancy meals etc is on the company dime because the ceo is always on the clock as long as he is meeting with business prospects or doing other company business those expenses will be justified for the corporation and not attributed as income

many of my friends turn to me for financial advice and here 's what i always tell them because it 's super effective for me 1 i opened an online bank account with scottrade for which i did not request a card or checks i set up direct deposit straight to that account it would be a complicated pain to take money out of that savings the only time i did so was to buy my house which was the purpose of the savings and it involved a wire transfer and printing of the form to fill out and it in etc i have continued to use the account to save for my second house i basically completely forget that the account is even there or that i am missing a large chunk of my money 2 it is very important to actually budget for spending money to continue to spend on impulse items basically allow yourself to spend money on yourself but in a controlled way decide a specific amount that you want to put in a separate account that is just for you to spend to your hearts content and have it direct deposit i find and dave ramsey also encourages this that when i know how much money i am going to blow i feel much more in control and it causes me to not get carried away and blow more than i realized take this a step further decide specifically what you want to buy for yourself and label the account accordingly for example i decided back in march that i wanted to buy an xbox one for when star wars comes out this november i calculated exactly how much money i would need at that time figured how many paychecks i would receive until then and did the math to determine exactly how much i need to direct deposit into an account just for saving to buy the xbox and game i use and i can actually rename the account as it is displayed so i called it xbox fund seeing that title a reminder of what i really want encourages me to not touch it what is your goal behind wanting to save money better what are you saving for label your account accordingly so you do n't just see it as money but as progress

hi alex   i 've been alerted you 're seeking a better answer to this question   please accept my apologies for not coming back to this question sooner it got buried   no in general you can not make an early withdrawal penalty free from a 403(b account to use towards the purchase of a home withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are generally subject to the 10 early withdrawal penalty on top of ordinary income tax some 403(b plans may allow for a loan but the availability and conditions vary by plan if you 'd consider a loan you should check with your plan administrator or your plan 's summary plan description often available at one 's company intranet or hr web site   i do contract work for an hr consulting firm that assists others in building such sites and are usually something made available for download in a retirement or wealth section of such web sites note that a loan from a 403(b would need to be paid back into the plan over some period of time e.g. 5 years though i have come across examples of some plans that do permit a longer pay back period of 10 15 even 30 years if the loan is used for a home purchase   but consider this article the 403(b loan the new debtors prison finally to your last point   yes if you have an ira there are rules permitting withdrawal of up to $ 10,000 penalty free for use towards the purchase of a first home   see page 53 in irs publication 590   there 's also a good article at all about iras for first time home buyers such a withdrawal from a traditional ira remains subject to ordinary income tax   if have a roth ira you can withdraw free of income tax but you need to pay attention to the roth ira 5 year rule additional resources

i agree with the article but one thing i wonder about how much is driving suppressed because of the relative high price of gasoline and the relative lack of fuel efficiency in cars in other words are we going to put more cars on the road and drive on average more km per yr per if we have a sort of quantum leap in fuel efficiency not necessarily a bad thing but perhaps something that makes achieving foreign oil independence a bit harder than we might think

sorry i always use my phone when using reddit and i 'm also not a native speaker basically what i tried to say is   the reason the whole world using this economic system is because when people divide their work force and everyone specializes on one thing they are much better at it gain more experience become more efficient and basically it is just more productive    that s why everyone has a job   but jobs has few downsides most prominent one being making all these repetitive tasks one can lose their purpose this is the situation for the poor community people who do not earn a lot of money and does n't have a good statue can be depressed by going to same place everyday doing the same thing for 40 50 years   for reason is everyone is doing repetitive tasks even if it is something you love personally i would hate my hobbies if i had to do them everyday not for enjoyment but for money but some are being rewarded much more    my goal of telling all these is this is not a perfect economic system but it is the most efficient one today people need motivation if they are going to do the same thing all the time the motivation could be different than money and statue but it is much easier to convince the masses these are important so the machine could work   only a fool with no regard to history would tell this is the best economic system and it will never change since world is always changing 5 years ago companies were banks and investment companies now they are tech internet my belief is that for now the system is structured and will stay the same until which changes the economy war economy needs other stuff compared to what we are producing normally motivation also changes in these times it 's not money anymore but for your countries sake and pride political system which is unusual to most since it is the economic change in classes which makes the political system to change

us australian tax treaty limits the tax the us can levy on interest payments to australian residents at 10 however that is the worst situation there are several exempted situations which your specific example may fall into where you would n't need to deal with the us taxes at all i suggest contacting a tax accountant proficient in that treaty and the australian tax law you will still be obviously paying taxes in australia

it is highly unlikely that this would be approved by a mortgage underwriter    when the bank gives a loan with a security interest in a property a lien they are protected if the borrower does not repay the loan the property can be foreclosed on and sold and the lender is made whole for the amount of the loan that was not repaid    when two parties are listed on the deed then each owns an undivided 50 share in the property   if only one party has pledged the property as surety against the loan then in effect only 50 of the property is   this means that the bank is unable to recoup its loss    for a fictional highly simplified concrete example suppose that the house is worth $ 100,000 and adam and are listed on the deed but adam is the borrower for a $ 100,000 mortgage   adam owes $ 100,000 and has an asset worth $ 50,000 which he has pledged as security for the loan while owes nothing and has an asset worth $ 50,000 which is entirely   if adam does not pay the mortgage the bank would only be able to foreclose on his $ 50,000 half of the property leaving them exposed to great risk    there are other legal and financial reasons but overall i think you 'll find it very difficult to locate a lender who is willing to take that kind of risk   it 's very complicated and there is absolutely no up side    also speaking from experience from which i was protected because of the bank 's underwriting rules and echoing the advice offered by others on this site do n't bother trying   commingling assets without a contract either implicit by marriage or explicit by well a contract is going to get you in trouble

it sounds like this is an entirely unsettled question unfortunately   in the examples you provide i think it is safe to say that none of those are substantially identical a small overlap or no overlap certainly should not be considered such by a reasonable interpretation of the rule this article on goes into some detail on the topic   a few specifics first former publication explains ordinarily shares issued by one mutual fund are not considered to be substantially identical to shares issued by another mutual fund of course what ordinarily means is and this is no longer a current publication so who knows the article goes on to explain that the irs has n't really gone after wash sales for mutual funds over the years the irs has not pursued wash sale abuses against mutual funds perhaps because it just was n’t very feasible to crack down on them or perhaps because it just was n’t perceived as that big of an abuse after all while the rules might allow you to loss harvest a particular stock you could n’t have otherwise it also limits you from harvesting any losses if the overall fund is up in the aggregate since losses on individual stocks ca n’t pass through to the mutual fund shareholders but then goes to explain about etfs being very different sell spy buy ivv or vti and you 're basically buying selling the identical thing 99 or so correlation in stocks owned    the recommendation by the article is to look at the correlation in owned stocks and stay away from things over 95 that seems reasonable in my book as well ultimately there will no doubt be a large number of grey and murky situations but i suspect that until the irs provides better guidance or congress updates the wash sale rules altogether in the near term the easiest red flag warning is simply to look at the correlation between the original investment being loss harvested and the replacement security at correlations above 0.95 and especially at 0.99 + it ’s difficult to argue that the securities are not substantially identical to each other in performance basically use common sense and do n't do anything you think would be hard to defend in an audit but otherwise you should be okay

i am on my cellphone so it 's a bit hard to flesh out but the thought of these cities is that drawing amazon will naturally draw other companies in as opposed to being appealing to many companies but not appealing enough for a move assuming favorable conditions are not infinite     so for example if there is an amazon hq there can soon be a google or fb base nearby as well think bank of america and wells fargo in charlotte and the natural attraction these pose for peripheral firms   but if there is just a small google and fb and amazon office you may not expect there to be as large of an appeal to other companies to move in starbucks lyft

the essential difference b n adr and a common share is that adr do not have voting rights common share has   there are some adr that would in certain conditions get converted to common stock but by and large most adr 's would remain adr 's without any voting rights if you are an individual investor this difference should not matter as rarely one would hold such a large number of shares to vote on general meeting on various issues the other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares for example in india an non resident can not directly buy any share hence he would buy adr thus adr would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand for example technologies an india company has adr on nyse this is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in india at current exchange rate thus if you are able to invest with equal ease in hk have broker trading account etc consider the taxation of the gains in hk as well the tax treatment in us for overseas gains then its recommended that you go for common stock in hk else it would make sense to buy in us

most of the people who in will probably tell you to spend as little as possible on a car but that is a really personal decision since you live with your parents you can probably afford to waste a lot of money on a car on the other hand you already have a large income so you do n't really have the normal graduate excuses for deferring student loans and retirement savings for the sake of other people in a less comfortable position here is a more general algorithm for making the decision

just general advice but you should pay off your credit cards and car loans before buying a house or you may be able to add some extra on to the mortgage to pay off your credit card and car debt right away credit card interest rates can be ten times the interest rates on mortgages and car loans are not far behind the sooner you get them paid off completely the sooner you will have enough money for mortgage payments

the key point to answer the question is to consider risk aversion assume i suggest a game to you throw a coin and if you win you get $ 5 if you lose nothing happens will you play the game of course you will you have nothing to lose what if i suggest this if you win you get $ and if you lose you must pay $ 10,000,000 i also accept cars houses spouses and as payment while the expected value of the second game is the same as for the first if you lose the second game you are more or less doomed to spend the rest of your life in poverty or not even have a rest of your life therefore you will not wish to play the second game well maybe you do but probably only if you are very very rich and can easily afford a loss even if you had $ you wo n't be as happy with a possible raise to $ as you 'd be unhappy with dropping to a mere $ 1,000,000 so you 'd still not like to play   some model this by taking if your capital grows from $ 500 to $ 1000 or from $ 1000 to $ 2000 in both cases it doubles hence is considered the same personal gain effectively and the of your capital grows by the same amount in both cases this that a rich man will not be as happy about finding a $ 10 note as a poor man will be about finding a nickel   the effect of an insurance is that you replace an uncertain event of great damage with a certain event of little damage of course the insurance company plays the same game with roles swapped so why do they play one point is that they play the game very often which tends to the risks unless you do something stupid and insure all inhabitants of san francisco and nobody else against but also they have enough capital that they can afford to lose the game in a fair situation i.e. when the insurance costs just as much as damage cost multiplied with probability of damage a rational you would eagerly buy the insurance because of risk aversion therefore the insurance will in effect be able to charge more than the statistically fair price and many will still buy it and that 's how they make a living the decision how much more one is willing to accept as insurance cost is also a matter of whether you can afford a loss of the insured item easily with regrets barely or not all

what would happen if you was to cash a check did n’t realize it was    to you and your finance company take it to a local business that has    a money center they cash the check without even having you sign let    alone having the finance companies endorsement on it the money    cleared my account like a couple months ago and it was just brought up    now the reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car the lender wants to make sure that their investment is protected   for example you get a six year loan on a new car in the second year you get hit by another driver the damage estimate is $ 1,000 and you decide it does n't look that bad so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts what you do n't know is that if they had done the repair they would have found hidden damage and the repair would have cost $ 3,000 and would have been covered by the other persons insurance   jump ahead 2 years the rust from the skipped repair causes other issues now it will cost $ 5,000 to fix the insurance wo n't cover it and now a car with an outstanding loan balance of $ 4,000 and a value of $ 10,000 if the damage did n't exist needs $ 5,000 to fix   the lender wants the repairs done they would have not signed the check before seeing the proof the repairs were done to their satisfaction but because the check was cashed without their involvement they will be looking for a detailed receipt showing that all the work was done they may require that the repair be done at a certified repair shop with manufacturer parts   if you do n't have a detailed bill ask the repair shop for a copy of the original one

yeah i guess the entire report is probably false because of that what you 're saying is applicable to the renewable industry too there 's all kinds of other investments made on behalf of renewables that are n't calculated into dollar amounts most obviously is the money that never even hits the books by subsidizing through consumer corporate tax breaks   for example the company you work for more than likely has a recycling program it does n't make money because it 's not profitable to recycle anything but aluminum but if they did n't have the program they would get penalized not directly necessarily but would lose out on green initiative funding    the rest of what you are saying is as intangible as the first thing if you think solar panels on your roof is going to keep the military out of other countries you 're clinical and if you ca n't notice a correlation between the total lack of production coupled with the massive amounts of money being wasted then there 's no discussion to be had    by the by that article has no citations and the link to any additional sourcing is broken

this stock is the same as any other but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities   you the person will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name   you 'll also owe regular tax if you draw a salary etc   the fact that it may be your company does not change these things the company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it 's nominally exchanging things of equal value say $ 100 in cash for $ 100 in stock   in order to sell stock however you might need to register with the sec depending on how you 're going about finding your investors so keep that in mind

this can be done and there have been many good suggestions on things to do and watch out for   but to my shock i do n't see anyone offering any words of caution about property managers whatever you do do n't assume they have your best interests at heart   do not assume that no news is good news and that if you are n't hearing of problems and are just collecting rent checks everything must be fine you can easily end up with tenants you would never have allowed yourself or tenants with pets that you would not have allowed etc   especially if the manager does n't want you to have a vacancy and potentially lose you as a client they may very well lower their standards just to get the place occupied   and a year or two or three later you may find yourself looking at a very large repair bill and wonder how on earth it could have happened when you supposedly had someone looking out for your property there are quality ethical property managers out there   they are not all bad to be certain   but whatever you do check up on them   and with multiple properties especially if in multiple areas states etc this can be nearly a full time job in itself   as the saying goes trust but verify   i have never found this to apply more than with rental properties and property management do n't leave anything significant to them 100   you ca n't even assume that a rule like all expenses over $ 50 must be cleared by me first as that can simply mean that they do n't bother to come to you for certain kinds of repairs that would cost more than that or that they just get them taken care of by their own person done poorly illegally etc and never tell you   never trust their choice of tenants blindly   visit the place yourself at least every few months a quick at a minimum or better if you can arrange a reason to walk through the house personally   check the back yard never assume that the front yard is indicative of anything else   never assume that a no pets rule will be followed or that tenants would n't lie to the management about having pets   never assume that the tenants wo n't move additional people into the property as well always expect a bare minimum of 1 month vacancy every year and an additional minimum of 1 month 's rental revenue in unexpected maintenance repairs every year   this is at a minimum   you might do much better than this and have a high quality tenant in place for years who costs next to nothing in extra maintenance   but do not count on it rental real estate investing looks so simple on paper where it 's just numbers   but reality has a very rude habit of surprising you when you least expect it after all no one expects the spanish good luck

unfortunately it 's not unusual enough   if you 're looking for a popular car and the dealer wants to make sure they are n't holding onto inventory without a guarantee for sale then it 's a not completely unreasonable request   you 'll want to make sure that the deposit is on credit card not cash or check so you can dispute if an issue arises    really though most dealers do n't do this requiring a deposit pre sale is usually one of those negotiating tactics where the dealer you into a deal even if they do n't have a good deal to make   dealers may tell you that you ca n't get your deposit back even if they do n't have the car you agreed on or the deal they agreed to   you do have a right for your deposit back if you have n't completed the transaction but it can be difficult if they do n't want to give you your money back   the dealer does n't ever not know if they have that specific vehicle in stock   the dealer keeps comprehensive searchable records for every vehicle it 's good for sales and it 's required for tax records   even when they did n't use computers for all this the entire inventory is a log book or phone call away in my opinion i would never exchange anything with the dealer without a car actually attached to the deal   i 'd put down a deposit on a car transfer if i were handed a vin and verified that it had all the exact options that we agreed upon and even then i 'd be very cautious about the condition

tl;dr sure do your own homework is sometimes a cop out but that does n't mean we should n't do our homework i agree that in many cases this is a cop out by commentators however even if you believe in perfect market efficiency there is benefit in doing your homework for many reasons one of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same value might have widely ranging risk another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences high dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others one stock might be priced at $ 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product this might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being $ 150 in 12 months and a 80 chance of being $ 20 another stock might be priced at $ 40 because the company is a cash cow declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $ 0.40 per quarter low risk but also with some potential tax disadvantages another stock might be priced at $ 40 because it 's a high growth stock this would be less risky than the first example but more risky than the second example and the risk would be more generalized i.e. there would n't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock in short even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone sometimes when we hear an analyst say they should have done their homework they are really saying this was a high risk high reward stock they should have known that this had a potential downside and that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency which many disagree with at least to some extent for example if we instead subscribe to peter lynch 's theories about local knowledge we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts a professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company this is especially true of small and mid cap stocks if you happen to be an expert in led lighting it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of doing homework on than the analysts or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work and you know that the latest version stinks then you will likely know more than the analyst does i think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor we could say to ourselves the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine i 'm just going to do what they tell me to do and 99 of the time that is the right thing to do but if we do our homework anyway and research the symptoms diagnoses and drugs ourselves as well we can do get benefits sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions sometimes we can ask smarter questions and sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor does n't have and can actually make an important discovery they did n't know and just like investing sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals

the simplest argument for overpayment is this let 's suppose your fixed rate mortgage has an interest rate of 4.00 every £ 1 you can afford to overpay gives you a guaranteed effective return of 4.00 gross yes your monthly mortgage payment will stay the same however the proportion of it that 's paying off interest every month will be less and the amount that 's actually going into acquiring the bricks and mortar of your home will be greater so in a sense your returns are inverted i.e. because every £ 1 you overpay is £ 1 you do n't need to keep paying 4 a year to continue borrowing in your case this return will be locked away for a few more years until you can remortgage the property however compared to some other things you could do with your excess £ this is a very generous and safe return that is well above the average rate of uk inflation for the past ten years let 's compare that to some other options for your extra £ cash savings the most competitive rate i can currently find for instant access is from icici if you are prepared to lock your money away until march 2020 building society has a fixed rate bond that will pay you gross on these accounts you pay income tax at your marginal rate on any interest received for a basic rate taxpayer that 's 20 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer that means 40 of this interest is deducted as tax in other words assuming you pay income tax at one of these rates to get an effective return of 4.00 on cash savings you 'd have to find an account paying cash isas these accounts are tax sheltered so the income tax equation is n't an issue however the best rate i can find on a 4 year fixed rate cash isa is from building society as you can see it 's a long way below the returns you can get from overpaying to find returns such as that you would have to take a lot more risk with your money for example stock market investments for example an index fund tracking the ftse 100 uk listed blue chip companies could have given you a total return of over the last 3 years past performance does not equal future returns over a longer time period this return should be better historical performance suggests somewhere between 5 to 6 is the norm but take a closer look and you 'll see that over the last six months of 2015 this fund had a negative return of i.e. for a time you 'd have been losing money how would you feel about that kind of volatility in conclusion i understand your frustration at having locked in to a long term fixed rate effectively insuring against rates going up then seeing rates stay low for longer than most commentators thought however overpaying your mortgage is one way you can turn this situation into a pretty good deal for yourself a 4 guaranteed return is one that most cash savers would envy in response to comments i 've uploaded a spreadsheet that i hope will make the numbers clearer i 've used an example of owing £ 100k over 25 years at an 4 interest and shown the scenarios with and without making a £ 100/month voluntary overpayment assuming your lender allows this here 's the sheet after one year you have made £ 1,200 in overpayments you now owe £ less than if you had n't overpaid   after five years you owe £ less on your mortgage having overpaid in £ 6,000 so far should you remortgage at this point that £ is your return so far and you also have £ 6k more equity in the property   if you keep going after 65 months you are paying more capital than interest out of your monthly payment this takes until 93 months without overpayments in total if you keep up £ 100/month overpayment you pay £ less interest overall and end your mortgage six years early you can play with the spreadsheet inputs to see the effect of different overpayment amounts hope this helps

withdraw in cash bank reports it to irs no matter what would this    affect my tax filing in the coming year no and no the bank does n't report to the irs in the us the bank will probably report to fincen it has nothing to do with your tax return withdraw in check bank does not seem to report it is this correct does n't have to still might if they think it is a suspicious irregular activity wire transfer to another person 's account would this always be    slapped with a gift tax if this is a gift it would regardless of how you transfer the money is it answers to your follow up questions in the us what documents do we need to prepare in case our large sum    withdraw from the bank triggers a flag in relevant government local    and/or federal divisions and they decide to investigate depending on what the investigators request fincen would investigate money laundering the irs would investigate tax evasion the fbi would investigate terrorism sponsorship etc depending on who 's investigating and what the suspicions are different documents may be required but the bottom line is that you should be able to explain the source of the funds and the destination for example i found $ 1 m in cash and sent it to some drug lord because he 's such a good friend of mine will probably not fly does the local federal government care if we stash our money in    cash or check under our mattress if we purchase foreign properties    taxable documents needed for proof or if we give it away to    individuals or organizations individual a gift tax organization    tax the government cares about taxes and illegal activities stashing money under a mattress is not illegal but earning cash and not paying income tax on it usually is in many cases money stashed under the mattress was obtained illegally and/or income taxes were not paid it seems that no matter what we do except spreading thin our assets    to multiple accounts in multiple banks the government will always be    notified of any large bank transaction and we would be forever flagged    since is this correct yes reportable transactions will be reported also spreading around in multiple accounts transactions to avoid reporting is called structuring and is on its own a crime this is for cash cash equivalent transactions only of course not sure about the forever flagged since that part is probably sourced in your imagination

because a paying down a liability and thus gaining asset equity is not technically an expense gnucash will not include it in any expense reports however you can abuse the system a bit to do what you want   the mortgage payment should be divided into principle interest and escrow tax insurance accounts for example a mortgage payment will then be a split transaction that puts money into these accounts from your bank account for completeness the escrow account will periodically be used to pay actual expenses which just moves the expense from escrow into insurance or tax this is nice so that expenses for a month are n't inflated due to a tax payment being made now this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports the trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses one way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it every time you record a mortgage payment add a transfer from this equity account into the principle payments expense account this will mess things up at some level since you 're inventing an expense that does not truly exist but if you 're using gnucash more to monitor monthly cash flow it causes the income expense report to finally make sense example transaction split

the basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors if the 5k in other debt is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt pay it off immediately do n't wait for the next statement once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue second keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you do n't have it keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans if the auto loan is materially higher pay it off then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans added this comment about credit with a view towards the op 's future something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest you can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will in a few years your account return your deposit and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account that 's the route i took with citi and wells fargo while over spending on credit cards can be tempting they are with a solid payment history the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact fico scores more than other type of credit or debt so make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always always pay each monthly bill in full this one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental buy a car on the best terms or get a mortgage at good rates and remember credit is not equal to debt maximize the former and minimize the latter

i have n't looked at that warranty in detail but generally speaking this should help what is gap insurance in the case of a total loss write off gap insurance covers the outstanding finance after your regular insurance pay out the two wo n't match up usually because of the depreciation right after you buy the car for example if you take out $ 20,000 finance and buy a car then write it off after six months your insurance company may only value it at $ 16,000 but it 's unlikely you will have cleared $ 4,000 from your finance gap insurance will pay out the difference and settle the debt will chrysler change the engine if it comes to yes unless they identify misuse or deliberate damage for instance if you do 1000 miles and the engine explodes it 's a mechanical fault that the warranty would cover if they open up the engine look at and find it 's been to within an inch of it 's life they may claim it was your driving which has destroyed the engine and you would have to prove it was an underlying fault and would have blown either way will car dents be covered with this bumper to bumper insurance not likely as i mentioned in the last point if it 's your fault it would n't be covered i think you may be confusing the terms insurance and warranty at this point insurance would cover your dents but a warranty only covers the manufacturer 's faults even in the case of extended warranties what does basic mean in terms of warranty sounds obvious but whatever chrysler want it to mean there 's no legal definition of basic so you would need to check the documents thoroughly or ask them to explain exactly what is and is n't covered if they 're reluctant it 's probably because basic covers very little

$ 100 k of mortgage debt at 4 30 years will result in a $ mortgage it would take about $ 23 k in income to have 25 of the monthly income cover the mortgage   this means that with no other large debts a bank will lend you about 4x your income   if instead of 25 we decided that having 20 of income go to the mortgage the ratio drops to just over   in the end it comes down to keshlam 's advice regarding a budget i think the question ca n't be answered as asked given the fact that you offer no numbers for the average person credit card debt student loans and cars payments add up to enough to chip away at the amount the bank will lend you since per one of the linked questions the maximum debt service should be 36 you start with that and subtract all current payments   if this does n't suffice let us know what exactly you 're looking for

before anything else read up on the basics of economics after that there a few things you need to ask yourself before you even think about investing in anything if you have an answer to those questions once you answered those questions i could make a simple first suggestion confident in handling it yourself and low maintenance with uncertain horizon look up an online bank that offers etfs such as accumulation dividend is not payed but reinvested or is payed out and maybe a few more specific ones then buy and hold for at least 5 years confident and high maintenance with long horizon maybe stock picking but you 'll probably never be able to beat the market unless you invest 10 's of hours in research per week however this will also cost a bit and given your initial amount not advisable to do be sure that you also have a very close look at the prospectus of an investment especially if you go with a retail bank and they recommend you certain actively traded funds they tend to charge you quite a bit yearly management fees of 2 3 which is a lot if you are maybe yearly are n't unheard of etf 's such only have for example a yearly cost of 0.20 personally i have one portfolio of many only consisting of that etf so and one global small cap it 's one of the best and most ones to date in the end the amount you start with does n't really matter so much as long as it 's enough to buy at least a few shares of what you have in mind if you can then increase your portfolio over time and keep the expenses in check compounding interest should do the rest

the other answers are good i would just like to add certain points taking this question together with the previous ones you have asked here how can a person measure how much to spend on food car bills or rent    from his salary is there a formula to keep in check basically it may well be that your best option would be to move to a smaller apartment or worse location to bring down rent possibly forget about your own study in the worst case sell the car and use public transportation eat as many meals as possible at home bring boxed lunch from home to work if this applies etc whatever makes a saving and sense to you regarding food this is the point where it is usually possible to save a very significant amount if you are prepared to make food at home unless you are already doing it look around for articles such as living on 20 pounds a week or so maybe they will give you ideas you can use eg how to eat on 10 pounds a week shopping list and recipes where you are shopping is crucial here as similar items can differ in price significantly between different chains if the electricity bill is significant and you are at home a lot you could try to bring it down by changing all bulbs in your home to led ones unless it has already been done yes they can cost 2 3 more than eg ones but they use 5 10x less electricity forget credit cards if possible use debit cards so you know the money you spend does not get you into more debt one question you asked here was about exchange rates if you work with different currencies a lot there are several companies such as revolut or which offer accounts with debit cards that use near fx rates in my i could save around 10 15 on currency conversion eur gbp using revolut compared to my local bank rate for example i find myself looking at my account every single day and get    and sad because almost whenever the money pay comes in i freak out    that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save well yes that is nearly the definition of too much debt the point about going to the extremes of reducing expenses i outlined above is that the more you can reduce your expenses while struggling with debt the faster you 'll get out of it it might be hard to adapt but it will be better if you can calculate how long it will take to get you back on feet and know that eg in 6 months i can start to think of savings and carefully upgrading my lifestyle back   in turn the smaller the reduction of expenses the more prolonged the process you might be looking at 2 3 years of insecure constantly frustrating risking more debt lifestyle instead of 6 months of severely reduced one alternatively if things go too bleak you might consider declaring bankrupcy although i am not sure how feasible it is in the uk

i 'm going to make an educated guess on 1 money markets invest in bonds with a very short time to maturity an mma at a bank will be invested in government bonds yields on these bonds are really low right now thus the yield on that mma is going to be pretty low when you make a deposit in a savings account the bank uses some of that money to lend back out to its customers in the form of car loans mortgages etc these rates are higher so the bank is willing to pay you a bit more than the yield mma so they can use your money for these loans for 2 your time window is short so there are n't really a lot of options for you keeping your money where it is will actually cost you money in fees you can do as i suggested in my comment above close the current savings account that 's hitting you with fees and open a free high yield savings account you might get 1.1 if you average $ 60k in the account over the next 6 months you 'll earn $ 200 250 after taxes you did n't ask about cds but lately shorter term cds are paying less than savings accounts going out to a year will get you just above the rate on a high yield savings account two years just a little more these are outside your goal window so they are n't an option for you

this is an unfortunate situation for you   you have zero chance at your question number 1 if someone was going to bend this rule for you it would have happened already   the answer to question number 2 is pursue solution number 3 the overriding issue is that the irs makes these rules not the employer plan sponsor or the administrator   you ca n't talk the plan administrator in to reimbursing you their system likely does n't even have a function to do so fsa timing issues can be complex and i think that 's the root of your issue because when an expense can be incurred date of service versus date of payment and when a claim must be filed are different things it 's really common to bend the rules on when a claim is submitted but not when it was incurred    it 's really common for an exiting employee to have 30 days to submit expenses for reimbursement   fsa expenses must always be incurred within the specified plan year or within your dates of employment if you were n't employed for the entire plan year this is specified by the irs   it seems like some wires were crossed when you asked this question   you were asking can i still incur claims and they were hearing how long do i have to submit an expense that has already been incurred some plans allow cobra continuation on fsa which generally does not make sense   your contributions to the plan would use after tax dollars but for folks who know they have an eligible expense coming it can make sense to continue via cobra in retain your eligibility under the plan so you can incur a claim after your employment termination regarding number 3   this sort of reimbursement would be outside the plan no precedent is necessary   you 've gotten them to claim it was their mistake they 're going to reimburse you for their mistake it has nothing to do with the fsa good luck

my answer has nothing to do with tax brackets or mathematics i 'm taking advantage of the leeway your question allowed but rather it has to do with career goals and promotion   large companies often have large policies procedures to go with them   one policy that sometimes exists which would make it a bad idea to accept a raise is employee can not be given more than one    salary increase in a 12-month period this means that if you accept a standard of living or merit increase of say 2 or 3 in april and then you apply for a job that would otherwise warrant a pay grade increase you may be forced to wait until the following year to get bumped to the proper pay grade of course this totally depends on the company but it would be advisable to check your company 's h.r. policy on that if you 're considering a move even a lateral one in the future

much of the interest on a loan comes in the first years of a mortgage so the sooner you can pay that off the better   but let 's see what the numbers say if you have a loan at 4 principal of $ 100,000 a term of 30 years then this gives monthly payments of $ using the excel pmt function if you sell the house after precisely 5 years worth of payments then you have made $ in payments you still owe $ suppose you sell the house for $ 100,000   that means you will be in the hole for $ 100,000 $ $ = now suppose you pay an extra $ 50 per month over the five years   the same calculation becomes $ 100,000 $ $ = so in this scenario which is a little simplistic you are $ better off the question you have to ask is whether you could have done better investing the $ 3,000 in extra payments somewhere else the cagr in doing this is 1.7 so you might be better off putting the money away running the same numbers for a 6 mortgage the cagr you have is about 2.7 edit i 've added a google docs spreadsheet read only that you can download and play with   feel free to correct anything you find edit 2   ok so i 've had a look at what joetaxpayer is saying in the comments below and now i agree   the cagr should be 4 where i want wrong was to assume that the $ 50 per month payments over the five years are worth $ 50 5 12 = $ 3000    this neglects the time value of money having small amounts of money periodically rather than all of it in a lump sum including this makes the effective value of the monthly $ 50 payments $ written as = in excel or google docs i 've added a tab to the original spreadsheet to show the different calculations   note that it still does n't quite come to 4 but i guess it 's a minor error in the sheet nb i know i 'm leaving out mortgage interest tax relief costs for selling etc etc

how accurate is implied volatility in predicting future moves how would you measure this   if the implied volatility says that there 's a 1 chance that a stock will double and it doubles was it right   you could also say that it says there 's a 99 change that it does n't double so was it wrong    what you could measure is the variance of daily returns over a time period and see how well that compares to implied volatility but there 's no way to compare iv with the absolute price movement   if a stock goes up 0.01 each day then the variance is 0 the daily returns are the same each day but over 250 the stock would go up $ 2.50

bank a only care about the credit limit at bank b when determining the maximum amount of credit they will grant you   in theory you might be able to convince them that by cancelling the other card they should increase the limit on their card   of course since you owe too much money to do a balance transfer before the cancelling of a card you will need them increase the limit first they will have to decide if your income credit usage history credit core and age of your account with them justifies the increase i do n't think you have a good plan for using the increased debt it is way to risky but if you have enough income to save 3 k a month you might be a good candidate for a higher credit limit

you seem to really have your financial act together   your combination of assets and ongoing savings makes you the ideal candidate for paying it off one way to look at it is that your mortgage offers you a place to invest at a fixed 2 rate i 'd really like to not have a house payment is all i need to hear   the flip side is the lecture that talks about long term market returns the fact that the combination of your deductible mortgage but 15 cap gain rate means you need 2.5 return to break even and odds are pretty high that will occur over the next 15 years pretty high does not equal guaranteed and i wo n't debate the value of sleeping soundly vs an excess 5 8 return on this money that you 'd maybe achieve   you have n't missed anything in fact though i advocate saving first you are already doing that this is above and beyond good work

i do n't know why a financial investor or a retail trader would do this but i can guess why a market maker in options would do this let us say you buy an option from an option market maker and the market maker sold the option to you he made a small profit in the bid ask spread but now he is holding a short position in the option with unlimited risk exposure so to protect himself he will take an offsetting position in the underlying and become delta neutral so that his position is not affected by the moves in the underlying in the end he can do this because he is not in the market to make money by betting on direction unlike the rest of us poor mortals he is making money from the bid ask spread so to ensure that his profits are not eroded by an adverse move in the underlying he will continuously seek to be delta neutral but once again this is for a market maker for market takers like us i still do n't understand why we would need to delta hedge

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

so they basically tried to make their antiquated methods faster rather than improve their methods   okay   not what i would have done   and apparently they are n’t advertising their improvements well either   what i do n’t see in that document is the percentage of people making less or more in all so i ca n’t tell if large numbers of people on one side or another are skewing the average in a direction nationally or in the government itself   those numbers would give us the whole picture rather than a distorted picture   also it seems the average wage is only $ 3.00 hour higher so that ’s something   your socialist universal price tells you are definitely seeing with distorted glasses   let it go for a little bit not to change your mind but to verify you are seeing as clearly as possible   they keep the wages basically equal across the u.s. because they are a nation wide entity that has to be internally self consistent

excel has two functions you can use your question has the cd with a apr and the savings account that mentions both apr and apy so convert them both to apy to compare them the savings account apy will return more money based on the numbers in your question vs the previous part was the math part of the answer the following takes into other considerations for this case the savings account will return a larger amount of money if the conditions do n't change the cd rate is guaranteed but the savings account could change every business day the savings rate could go up or down if you expect the savings account rate to rain higher than the cd you might not want to lock into the cd if you expect the savings rate will drop then get the cd of course   there are penalties if you cash in the cd early

it 's funny how you say they will resort to laws to stop consumers from getting what they want when in reality the so called upstarts are the ones on very thin ice with breaking the law   if you define netflix as an upstart then i can already see that we do n't agree on the same premise and hence further argument is pointless   and for the record was only possible with tv and all the talented people in production   do you really think youtube or netflix will be able to produce a quality show   i think not   like i pointed out everyone is giving too much credit to netflix because it 's easy to stream a show after the risk has already been taken to spend the time and money to produce a show   this is why these upstarts operate on a profitable margin they are eating tv cable 's lunch   i am all for tv i believe that tv will still be around 50 years from now   the internet and tech is very volatile and you never know where it will stand 5 even 10 years from now   in the end people do not want to watch cheap low quality comedy on their iphones   60 inch lcd home theaters are here to stay in peoples homes   maybe it will be streamed via the internet but tv will very much still pull a lot of weight   afterall tv built the industry they deserve to own it     i do n't see the logic and destroying tv to benefit companies like apple or netflix who really have no idea how to even begin on a quality show    this boils down to the fact that people will always consume the cheapest form of entertainment and while this is true   americans are sophisticated enough to distinguish cheap from quality   tv delivers quality and will continue to deliver quality while the internet delivers a few occasional packaged in mediocrity

this is known as zone pricing or geographical pricing such price variations may seem odd but they are not unique to on any given day in any major u.s. city a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same the primary culprit is zone pricing a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume station amenities nearby household incomes the strength of competitors and other factors it 's a controversial strategy but the courts have thus far deemed it legal and the federal trade commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones zone pricing as practiced in the gasoline industry in the united states is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors such as the number of competing stations number of vehicles average traffic flow population density and geographic characteristics this can result in two branded gas stations only a few miles apart selling gasoline at a price differential of as much as $ 0.50 per gallon but the short answer is because they can it 's legal provided that some people are paying less while others are paying more essentially the larger richer audience is subsidizing the product for other areas it 's not terribly different than the way most drugs are priced in the world

the greece debt crisis started after the global financial crisis let 's say 2008 they were indebted with 103 of their annual economic output gdp this rose to 175 of gdp in 2013 different reasons    their gdp dropped about 1/3 from economy based on olive oil and tourism was unsustainable huge public service sector military and    greece could not be trusted to pay back loans so the european union had to jump in to be a lender of last resort in the middle of this year they finally offered the first tranche of treasuries so they are slowly coming back to be stabilized   but change is slow they are still above 175 of gdp in debt they still have negative growth and they still need to rely on help from allies    now that the german elections are over you might hear something about the crisis again i think there is supposed to be negotiations about future aid for greece   greece already had substantial hidden debt cuts extension of their bay back period and so on but you since it is a political subject you can only do so much till the politicians start to fear a backlash from their constituents

i believe you are missing a complete aspect of figuring out price points you completely disregarded how price affects perceived quality people generally assume that higher price means higher quality pricing too low will give many people the impression that at that price it could n't be very good and do n't buy the product as a result   crown royal became crown royal after being a mediocre brand they did n't change the way they made whiskey instead they raised the price by 400 now it was viewed as a premium product simply because of it 's price   while i do n't want to knock your view of tycoon games but it 's just a game with one point of view it 's not the real world it 's just what a programmer thought would make the game interesting i sure would n't consider it to be some source of great business wisdom   look at what really happens taking video game consoles and games as an example they start at a high price point this makes it prestigious to own when that price point becomes saturated meaning everyone that is going to buy at the price already has they lower the price a little and do the same then when everyone that can afford that price has bought one they lower it again eventually it gets to a point where almost anyone can afford   this style taps the market for every price point and is much better model than the one you suggest there are many things that use this model like car sales the end of a model year is the time to buy because everyone that was willing to pay the full price already had and they need to move them off the lot to make room for new cars that will have a higher price point   so i do n't buy into your theory at all   edit grammatical error

one of the main tax loopholes more readily available to the wealthy in the u.s. is the fact that long term capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate certainly people making less than $ can take advantage of this as well but the fact is that people making say $ likely have a much smaller proportion of their income available to invest in say indexed mutual funds or etfs you may wish to read wikipedia 's article on capital gains tax in the united states you can certainly make the argument that the preferential tax rate on capital gains is appropriate and the wikipedia article points out a number of these nevertheless this is one of the main mechanisms whereby people with higher wealth in the u.s. typically leverage the tax code to their advantage

if human beings were i.e. textbook rational and self interested economic minded beings as opposed to simply human then yes simple advice like just stay out of debt and your credit score will take care of itself could work   your simplification would be very persuasive to such a being however people are not perfectly rational   we buy something we should n't have we charge it on a credit card we ca n't afford to pay it off at the end of the month   we lose our job   our furnace breaks down or our roof leaks and we did n't anticipate the replacement cost   some of this is our fault some of it is n't basically shit happens and we get into debt   maybe even knowing all the while we should n't have our credit history and score takes a hit   only then do we find out there are consequences our interest rates go up our insurance companies raise premiums our prospective new employers or landlords run credit checks and either deny us the job or the apartment telling a person who asks for help about their credit history score that they should n't have taken on debt in the first place is like telling the farmer he should have kept the barn door shut so the horse would n't run out   while it is not bad advice it 's not the only kind of advice to offer when somebody finds themselves in such a situation adding advice about actions is more helpful   the person probably already know that they should n't have overspent in the first place and got into debt   yes remind them of the value of being sensible about debt in the first place it 's good reinforcement but add some helpful advice to the mix   e.g. so you 're in debt   you should n't have lived beyond your means   but now that you are in this mess here 's what you can do to improve the situation

for restricted stock i think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from irs pub 550 wash sales acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade i base this on these two quotes from irs pub 525 restricted property any income from the property or the right to use the property is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property until the property becomes substantially vested it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you usually your employer   so on the vest date the transfer is taxable ownership is transferred to you that seems close enough to a fully taxable trade for me   maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date see pub 525 restricted property choosing to include in income for year of transfer obviously if this is important you should consult your tax advisor   technicalities aside i do n't think it passes the sniff test you 're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests if you 're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date that smells like a wash sale to me

what could the tax issues with the irs be i thought but not totally certain that the tax treatment of an iso option was based on difference between exercise price and fmv at the time of the sale   this is an accounting issue there were times not so long ago that companies actually did these things on purpose to boost the stock grant values for their employees especially senior employees they would give a grant but date it with an earlier date with a more favorable valuation this is called and it brought companies down and ceos into criminal courts in addition only reasonable compensation is allowed as a deduction for the company and incorrectly set strike price may be deemed unreasonable thus the deduction the company would take for your compensation can be denied leading to loss of tax benefit this was also a weapon used by the irs at the time against companies doing last but not least company that has intentions of going public can not allow itself such a blatant disregard of the accounting rules even if the mistake was not made on purpose as it sounds it is a mistake that has to be corrected what should i take into consideration to determine whether a 27 increase in shares is a fair exchange for an increase in 270 increase in strike price did you know the strike price when you signed the contract was it a consideration for you for most people the strike price is determined at the board approval since the valuations are not public and are not disclosed before you actually join which is already after you 've agreed to the terms so basically you agreed to get 100 sheets of toilet paper and instead getting sheets so you 're getting 27 sheets more than you initially agreed to why are you complaining in other words options are essentially random numbers which are quite useless by the time you get to exercise them they 'll be diluted through a bunch of additional financing rounds and their value will be determined for real only after the ipo or at least when your company 's stocks are trading otc with some reasonable volume until then it 's just a number with not much of a meaning the fmv does matter for early exercise and 83(b election if that is an option but even then i doubt you can actually negotiate anything

in its basic form a corporation is a type of privileged democracy instead of every citizen having a vote votes are allocated on the basis of share ownership in the most basic form each share you own gives you 1 vote in most public companies very few shareholders vote because their vote is statistically meaningless and they have no particular insight into what they want in their board this means that often the board is voted in by a ie of shareholders who are actually large institutions like investment firms or pension funds which own many shares of the company now what do shareholders actually vote on you vote to elect individuals to be members of the board of directors bod the bod is basically an overarching committee that theoretically the company in whatever way they feel best represents the shareholders because if they do not represent the shareholders they will get voted out at the next shareholder meeting the board members are typically senior individuals with experience in either that industry or a relevant one ie someone who was a top lawyer may sit on the bod and be a member of some type of legal issues committee these positions typically pay some amount of money but often they are seen as a form of high prestige for someone nearing after retirement it is not typically a full time job it will typically pay far far less than the role of ceo at the same company   the bod meets periodically to discuss issues regarding the health of the company their responsibility is to act in the interests of the shareholders but they themselves do not necessarily own shares in the company often the bod is broken up into several committees such as an investment committee which reviews and approves large scale projects a finance committee which reviews and approves large financial decisions such as how to get funding an audit committee which reviews the results of financial statements alongside the external accountants who audit them etc but arguably the main role of the bod is to hire the chief executive officer and possibly other high level individuals typically referred to as the c suite executives ie chief financial officer chief operating officer etc the ceo is the big cheese who then typically has authority to rule everyone below him her typically there are things that the big cheese can not do without approval from the board like start huge investment projects requiring a lot of spending   so the shareholders own the company and are therefore entitled to receive all the dividends from profits the company earns and members of the board of directors the bod oversees the company on the shareholders behalf and the ceo acts based on the wishes of the bod which hires him her so how do you get to be a member of the board or the ceo you become a superstar in your industry and go through a similar process as getting any other job you network you make contacts you apply you defend yourself in interviews the shareholders will elect a board who acts in their interests and the board will hire a ceo that they feel can carry out those interests if you hold a majority of the shares in a company you could elect enough board members that you could control the bod and you could then be guaranteed to be hired as the ceo if you own say 10 of the shares you will likely be able to elect a few people to the board but maybe not enough to be hired by the board as the ceo   short of owning a huge amount of a company therefore share ownership will not get you any closer to being the ceo

no my argument is that our system is designed to allow the executive and judicial branch to legislate if the legislative branch ca n't legislate might not be the appropriate word but a decision from the executive branch becomes defacto law if the judicial branch determines that    1 legislation exists allowing the executive branch to make that call as is the case with nlrb    or    2 it does n't conflict with current legislation    after that point its up to the legislative branch to pass a law that negates it     that is just a fact of our system of government yes its fucking anti democracy as hell but imo its less terrible than having no legislation passed

the mortgages were pooled with other mortgages and sold off to other firms in theory mitigating the risk however the reason lenders searched out these types of deals was because they could use the lack of credit rating etc as an excuse to charge much higher interest rates    chase and most lenders made their money by borrowing their funds from some other institution and then lender it out to these borrowers so they were always looking for a large yield spread account executives made more money on sub prime because everyone made more money on those deals    that is of course until the pools hit a percentage rate of foreclosures forcing a buy back of the pool then all of the small time players like new century went bust when their investors called them to buy the pools of mortgages back

it has got to do with market perceptions and expectation and the perceived future prospects of the company usually the expectation of a company 's results are already priced into the share price so if the results deviate from these expectations the share price can move up or down respectfully for example many times a company 's share price may be beaten down for increasing profits by 20 above the previous year when the expectation was that it would increase profits by 30 other times a company 's share price may rise sharply for making a 20 loss when the expectation was that it would make a 30 loss then there is also a company 's prospects for future growth and performance a company may be heading into trouble so even though they made a $ 100 m profit this year the outlook for the company may be bleak this could cause the share price to drop accordingly conversely a company may have made a loss of $ 100 m but its is turning a corner after reducing costs and restructuring this can be seen as a positive for the future causing the share price to rise also a company making $ 100 m in profits would not put that all into the bank it may pay dividends with some it may put some more towards growing the business and it might keep some cash available in case cash flows fluctuate during the year

you 're talking about porting your mortgage which may be possible if your mortgage was portable to start with or if your bank subsequently allows it note that although porting a mortgage involves keeping most of the original terms and conditions the process is still much like applying for a new mortgage including any lending requirements here 's an article on the subject edit in response to op 's comment below what will happen to the first property if i do n't sell it because porting a mortgage is treated as if you were closing one mortgage and opening a new one this means that you would need to pay off the first mortgage typically this would be done by selling the first property at the same time that you buy the second one however if you 're not doing this you 'll need to raise funds another way which could include opening a new mortgage on the first property of course if you 're doing that then there would have to be a good reason for porting the original mortgage otherwise you might as well leave it where it is and open a new mortgage on the second property instead does the article apply the to usa too that article and indeed this answer are based on the situation in the uk however they appear to exist in the us too though are rarer than in the uk

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

there are a few different ways you can look at this   you ca n't really take money out of the economy as it ca n't leave society and the economy is the interaction of society one example kind of close to this was a multi millionaire died without an heir with millions in his bank account the bank will continue to use the funds but the money itself wo n't be spent some people saw this as a waste like value was lost but really all it does hoarding money or even burning it is change the money supply   that being said there are two approaches to looking at capitalism as a balanced ecosystem one is which focuses on demand the other is marxism which focuses on more internal mechanisms of capitalism both are concerned with inequality   with high inequality those with capital tend to have more reinvestment as a percentage of income wealth with a return on investment this will increase inequality the keynesian issue is that this will lower demand creating imbalance in the economy and long term problems to function the answer was more redistribution and higher labor wages   for marxists they believe that capitalism generates endless capital accumulation not because of a demand component but because of labor theory of value that wealth and value is not determined by the market but at exploitation of labor on this critical side you have of the of market value with high inequality you have money leaving the system in what some call waste something not socially useful and in monopoly capital talk about this in the form of things like military spending and i think advertisement but it can also relate to the generation of wealth opposed to income things that do n't hold inherent value like art becomes investment you ca n't say it is taken out of the economy but the value itself is generated by those who can purchase it though i believe this value is more an outcome of the rather than the cause   what it does contribute to however is the rise of speculation rather than consumption or productive investment accumulation will increasingly become speculative real estate is usually the primary example many people buy houses condos or land not for use but for the expectation that the value will go up when bad enough this can the market so for people who are n't investing their rent living cost increases    this likewise happens with stocks and other financial investments again it ca n't really leave the economy but it makes it more difficult for the traditional or productive and labor economy to operate

i would be using stop limit orders for stocks that are not too volatile if you look at the chart and there are not many gaps especially after peaks then you have more chance of being filled at your specified stop loss level using a stop limit order if the stock is very volatile and has a large or many gaps down after most peak then i would consider using a stop market order to make sure you do get out even if it is somewhat past your desired stop level one think to consider is to avoid trading very volatile stocks that gap often this is what i do and using stop limit orders my stop level is achieved more than 95 of the time

in my mind its not the same    if growth is stock value then this is incorrect because of compound interest in stock price $ 100 stock price after one year would be $ 105 and a dividend would be $ 2 next year the stock would be   $ compound interest and would the dividend really go up in lock step with the stock price well probably not but if it did then maybe you could call it the same even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two i am open to criticism my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this

when you buy a property the house or the building goes down in value every year it gets depreciated similar to when you drive a new car out of the lot however it is the land that increases in value over time as land becomes the value of land in that area will increase in value as does land in sought after areas if more people want to live in a particular suburb the land value will keep on increasing year after year sometimes established areas with houses built in the 1980s or even earlier can be worth much more than newly built areas it comes down to the supply and demand of land and houses in a particular area you might even get a situation where a run down dilapidated house in a very sought after suburb sells for more than a brand new house in a less sought after suburb nearby properties can be a very good investment and they can be a very poor investment it can largely depend on the decisions you make in buying your investment property the first thing you need to make a decision on is the location of the property if you buy a property in a good area that is well sought after you can make good capital and rental returns over the long run if you buy poorly in an area no one wants to live in then you might have problems renting it out or only be able to rent it out to bad tenants who cause damage and you may not get any capital gains over many years the second thing you need to decide on is when in the property cycle you buy the property if you buy at the right time you can get higher rents and make some quick capital gains over a relatively short time i can provide a personal example of this situation i had bought a house in australia in 2007 for $ 240,000 at a time when interests where at their highest 9 no one was buying property and rents were on the increase with low vacancy rates today eight years after we are getting $ 410 per week rent and the house next door in worse condition than ours has been put on the market asking for between $ 500,000 to $ most houses in the area had been selling during this year for over $ 500,000 so you can say that our house has more than doubled in 8 years however up to a few months ago houses were selling within 2 weeks of being listed the house next door however has been listed for over a month and has not had very much interest so from this you can conclude that in 2007 we had bought near the bottom of the market whilst now we are near the top of the market what you also need to remember is that different areas of a country can have different cycles so there is not just one property cycle but many property cycles in the same country

your question is a bit odd in that you are mixing long term fundamental analysis signals which are generally meant to work on longer time frames with medium term trading where these fundamental signals are mostly irrelevant   generally you would buy and hold on a fundamental signal and ride the short term fluctuations if you believe you have done good analysis if you would like to trade on the 2 6 month time scale you would need a signal that works on that sort of time scale   some people believe that technical analysis can give you those kind of signals but there are many many many different technical signals and how you would trade using them is highly dependent on which one you believe works some people do mix fundamental and technical signals but that can be very complicated   learning a good amount about technical analysis could get you started   i will note though that studies of non professionals continuously show that the more frequently people trade the more on they underperform on average in the long term when compared with people that buy and hold an aside on technical analysis michael 's comment is generally correct though not well explained   say bob found a technical signal that works and he believes that a stock that costs $ 10 dollars should be $ 11   he buys it and makes money two months later when the rest of the market figures out the right price is $ 11 and he sells at that price   this works a bunch of times and he now publishes how the signal works on stack exchange to show everyone how awesome he is   next time bob 's signal finds a different stock at $ 10 that should be $ 11 but anna just wrote a computer program that checks that signal bob published faster than he ever could   the computer program buys as much as it can in milliseconds until the price is $ 11   bob goes to buy but now it is too late the price is already $ 11 and he ca n't make any money eventually people learn to anticipate adjust for this signal and even anna 's algorithms do n't even work anymore and the hunt for new signals starts again

as of now you are doing that when you start earning larger sums of money you will not withdraw and keep it in your house you will leave it in the bank and they will earn money on it by lending it out at a higher interest rate when you are broke that same bank will offer you a credit card or some other instrument that will help you survive they will charge you money on that and make interest of you when you have too much money and you start wiring money they will charge you a wire transfer fees there are more than 500 ways in which banks make money off you if you plan receiving $ 100 and $ 250 all your life and withdraw it immediately and do n't plan doing anything else all your life then you will probably not let the bank make any money off you however there are a very few people like that and banks barely lose anything accepting those customers

the catch with any exchange service is that you 're going to involve some sort of business and they 're going to want to get paid for their service these services all come with their own exchange rates fees waiting periods or requirements to even use said service commonly pros towards one of those comes at the cost of e.g. fast transfers have higher fees or worse exchange rates over the past few months i needed a service and ended up using since you 're going from cad to usd you 'd likely need to use pros   cons   overall this option was far better than the $ i was quoted from or the $ 25.00 i was quoted from bmo harris which would have required i open a saving account with them i was n't provided a clean exchange rate between these two to know how all three compared the only bit of advice i can say with any service is compare exchange rates if you 're transferring more than a few hundred dollars the exchange rate can be seen as a hidden fee when it 's unreasonably low i 'm not affiliated with or by any of the exchange services mentioned

i have always found that the free planners are just salesmen pointing you in their best interests not that it wo n't get you a good deal in the processes but in my experience they usually just recommend products that give them the best commission finders fee kickback whatever   flat fee financial planners are not really to my liking either this is a taste thing but generally i feel like now that they have my fee what interest do they have in taking care of me that does n't mean that they do n't give good advise however they may be a good first step percentage based financial planners those that charge a percentage of assets under management are my recommendation the more money they make me the more money they make this seems to work out quite well   whatever you do you need to be aware that financial planners are not just about recommending products or saving money that 's part of it but a good planner will also help you look at monthly budgets current costs liabilities and investments you want to look for someone that you can basically tell your goal to i want to have x amount of money saved for y date for example or i want to reduce my bills by z amount in x months   run from any planner that looks only at the large sum as the solution or only source of money you want a planner that will look at your first house care loans income other investments etc and come up with a full plan for everything   if you 're only trying to invest the new house money and that 's it you 're better off just sticking with google and some research on your own

there are a few flaws in your reasoning i know my portfolio will always keep going up no it wo n't   you 'll have periods of losses   you are starting your investing in a bull market   do not be fooled into believing that your successes now will continue indefinitely the more risky your portfolio the bigger the losses   the upside of a risky portfolio is that the gains generally outweigh the losses but there will be periods of losses i honestly do n't believe that it 's possible for me to end up losing in the long term regardless of risk i think you vastly underestimate the risk of your strategy and/or the consequences of that risk    there 's nothing wrong with investing in risky assets since over time you 'll get higher than average returns but unless you diversify you are exposing yourself to catastrophic losses as well

this would be my suggestion i would approach the problem thinking about the loss of monthly income you as a couple will be facing due to your wife 's change to a part time job and divide that loss between the two of you this means that if she goes from 2200 to 1100 monthly you 'd be losing 1100 per month   to share this loss you could repay your wife your part of the loss 550 so both of you are 550 euro down however this 550 loss is a bigger burden for your wife than it is for you so this amount could be adjusted to make up for this inequality   to make calculations simple and avoid developing a complicated model you could give the 800 euro above your 3k to your wife for as long as she has to work part time

assets can be acquired in different ways and for different purposes i will only address common legal ways of acquiring assets you can trade one asset for another asset this usually takes place in the form of trading cash or a cash equivalent for an asset the asset received should be of equal or greater value than the asset given in the eyes of the purchaser in order for the trade to be rational take this example i am selling a bike that has been sitting on my porch for a few months it 's worth about $ 25 to me my friend andy comes by and offers $ 90 for it i happily accept andy valued the bike at $ 110 this transaction produced value for both parties i had a value benefit of $ 65 90 25 and andy had a value benefit of $ 20 110 90 you can receive an asset as a gift or an inheritance less common but still frequent someone gives you a gift or a family member dies and you receive an asset you did not own previously you can receive an asset in exchange for a liability when you take out a loan you receive an asset cash which is financed by a liability loan payable in your case why would i buy a mall if having assets worth the same amount as the mall i must value the mall more than the assets i currently have this may stem from the possibility of greater future returns than i am currently making on my asset or if i financed the purchase with a liability greater future returns than the cost associated with payment on the principal and interest of the liability

for any accounts where you have a wish to keep track of dividends gains and losses etc you will have to set up a an account to hold the separately listed securities   it looks like you already know how to do this   here the trading accounts will help you especially if you have finance quote set up to pull security prices from the internet for the actively managed accounts you can just create each managed account and not fill it with the separate securities   you can record the changes in that account in summary each month year as you prefer so you might set up your chart of accounts to include these assets and this income the actively managed accounts will each get set up as type stock   you will create one fake security for each account which will get your unrealized gains losses on active accounts showing up in your trading accounts   the fake securities will not be pulling prices from the internet   go to      tools > securities editor > add and type in a name such as merrill lynch brokerage a symbol such as and in the type field input something like actively managed in your self managed accounts you will record dividends and sales as they occur and your securities will be set to get quotes online   you can follow the general gnucash guides for this    in your too many transactions actively traded accounts maybe once a month you will gather up your statements and enter the activity in summary to tie the changes in cost basis   i would suggest making each fake share equal $ 1 so if you have a $ 505 dividend you buy 505 shares with it   so you might have these transactions for your brokerage account with merrill lynch for example when you have finished making your period end summary entries for all the actively managed accounts double check that the share balances of your actively managed accounts match the cost basis amounts on your statements   remember that each fake share is worth $ 1 when you enter it   once the cost basis is tied you can go into the price editor tools > price editor and enter a new price as of the period end date for each actively managed account   the price will be value of active acct at period end cost of active acct at period end   so if your account was worth $ but had a cost basis of $ 505 on jan. 31 you would type in the price field and jan. 31 2017 in the date field when you run your reports you will want to choose the price source as nearest in time so that gnucash grabs the correct quotes this should make your actively managed accounts have the correct activity in summary in your gnucash income accounts and let them work well with the trading accounts feature

yes 6 is a waste of money because some other brokers such as ib offer margin rates below 2    also to borrow money for even less than any broker 's margin interest rate one can do an transaction    this involves simultaneously shorting a stock and buying the for the same stock    when the futures contract expires you take delivery of the underlying stock to automatically close out your short position   until then you 've effectively borrowed cash for the cost of borrowing the stock which is typically less than 0.5 interest for widely traded ones   you also pay for the slight difference in price between the stock and the future which is typically equivalent to another 0.5 interest or less   the total often comes to less than 1 interest the only risk with this transaction is that the stock could become hard to borrow at some point so then you would have to pay higher interest on it temporarily or maybe even have to close out your short early   but it is extremely rare for large high volume stocks to become hard to borrow   the borrowing cost of spy has spiked above 5 on only a handful of days in the last decade

ok i 'll ask does the job offer a 401(k matching deposits you see the answers given depend on your risk tolerance there are two schools of thought one extreme will tell you not to start investing until you have the emergency fund set up the other start from day one i accept there are pros and cons to either approach   but if you have access to a matched 401(k even a conservative risk adverse approach might agree that a 100 match on the first say 5 of your income is preferable to saving in a low return emergency fund if the emergency occurs a low interest loan for the need is a cheap way out since the money goes in pre tax and is matched being able to borrow out half irs rules effectively lets you borrow more than you deposited out of pocket and the word emergency implies a low occurrence event deposit to the match and start the emergency fund in another account   if no matched 401(k at work the other two answers are great   edit to clarify and answer a comment below say the risk is n't just a money emergency but job loss $ 1000 deposited to the 401(k cost $ 850 out of pocket assuming 15 bracket after the match it 's $ 2000 after the job loss if this is withdrawn if the 15 still applies it may be 10 or even 0 the net is $ 1700 less the 10 penalty or $ 1500 back in your pocket   there are those who will say they are just not comfortable running an emergency account so lean i understand that for the op here $ 800/mo is nearly $ 10,000 per year if even half of that can be deposited pre tax and matched the account will grow very quickly and there would still be cash on the side

even where national law might allow such a practice the law in an individual province or state either for issuing or receiving bank might not or if that does then the receiving bank may have its own regulations or compliance practice which may not permit them to accept an altered cheque   in any case printed numbers are usually machine readable and a corrected cheque would not be   the question needs a specific answer which addresses the specific circumstances involved which are not stated at the time of writing this but for the general question should i alter a printed cheque the answer must be no cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque in many cases there is no verification of and it would be perfectly acceptable simply to use cheques with duplicate numbers a cheque is merely an order to the bank to make a payment but you would not be able to identify a particular payment on your statement and neither would the issuing bank if you wanted one stopped where the number is verified as unique then clearing the payment may be refused or at best delayed in order to be making an obvious amendment to a cheque ’s details is likely to raise a red flag the receiving bank would not be able to tell if you did it or the payee they would not know why they may suspect that it was done in order to render the cheque even though the opposite is in fact the case and refuse to accept it they may refuse to accept it because it could not be read automatically any refusal would sour your relationship with your payees presumably your printing house or your bank if they printed them has made the error raise it with them and have them the batch ask your bank what to do with the incorrect cheques they may want them returned to the bank or they may be happy for you to keep and even use them if the latter i suggest you shred them

a breakdown of stock buy backs has this bottom line on it are share buybacks good or bad as is so often the case in finance the question may not have a definitive answer if a stock is undervalued and a buyback truly represents the best possible investment for a company the buyback and its effects can be viewed as a positive sign for shareholders watch out however if a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios provide short term relief to an ailing stock price or to get out from under excessive dilution read more what is the reason that a company like aapl is buying back its own    shares   offsetting dilution would be my main thought here as many employees may exercise options putting more stock out there that the company buys back stock to balance things does it have too much cash and it does n't know what to do with it   no as it could do dividends if it wanted to give it back to investors so it is returning the cash back to investors not quite while some investors may get cash from apple i 'd suspect most shareholders are n't likely to see cash unless they are selling their shares so i would n't say yes to this without qualification at the same time the treasury shares apple has can be used to give options to employees or be used in acquisitions for a couple of other purposes

there are two basic kinds of derivatives forward contracts and options    a forward is an agreement between two parties for one party to buy sell some asset to the other at a price that they agree upon today at some date in the future an option is an agreement that gives one party the right but not the obligation to buy sell the asset at some date in the future   most derivatives that exist are a combination of these two things for instance a futures contract is a standardized forward contract that is traded on an exchange and a swap is a portfolio or chain of forward contracts linked together american options are just options that allow you to exercise on more than one day

it 's always a good move for risk averse person in europe because houses are not represented by number in an index therefor if you are risk adverse you will suffer less pain when house prices go down because you wo n't have a number to look at everyday like the s&p500 index because houses in europe germany italy spain are almost all made by concrete and really well done string real marble cover hard ceramic covers copper pipes compared to the ones in us the house will still be almost new after 30 years it will just need a repaint and really few cheap because on the long run years are guaranteed to rise in price in dense places like big city ny san francisco etc the reason is simple the number of people is ever growing in this world but the quantity of land is always the same moreover there is inflation do you really think that 30 years from now building a concrete house will be less expensive than today do you think the concrete will cost less do you think the gasoline that moves the trucks that bring the concrete will be less expensive than now do you think the labour cost will be less than now so 30 years from now building an house will be much more expensive than today and therefor your house wil be more expensive too on the run stock market do not guarantee you to always increase the us stock market have always been growing in the long run but japan stock market today is at the same level of 30 years ago guess what happened to you if you invested your money in the japan stock market 30 years ago your friend bought an in japan 30 years ago he would now be rich and you would now be poor

any commercially distributed product needs to be taxed depending on country of residence and distribution legislation varies widely therefore the best place to ask would be your local small business counsel or even your local taxation office depending on the size of your business you might need a license to sell them in the first place anyway and that comes with its own set of

without commenting on whether or not it 's needed i do n't think we are going to see a qe3 and all the political pressure is for some reason to start raising rates   regardless of how it plays out it 's safe to say that the fed rate is n't going any lower    you should also watch closely what happens to fannie and freddie   if they are dismantled and government backed mortgages become a thing of the past then i think it 'll become impossible for a consumer to find a 30 year fixed rate mortgage   even if they are kept alive they will be put on a short leash and that will serve to further depress the mortgage market long story short i 'd lock your rate in

bonds are priced very high because their price is compared to their yields with the current interest rates which are very low the bond yields will be low however bond issuers still need the money so there still will be high par value and investors will not sell bonds at a loss unless there 's a better investment = bonds with better yields once the rates start going up you 'll see bonds with current rates dropping in value significantly once alternatives appear people holding them will start dumping them to move the money somewhere more profitable similarly the stocks since there 's no other investment alternatives yields on the bonds are low interests are low people invest more in the stocks once the rates go up the investors will start rebalancing portfolios and cashing out

because people who work with practical skills work for their own means and not for corporations   the banks are heavily invested in corporations   the banks are also heavily invested in debt   our entire system is orchestrated by the banks they want a workforce that is highly specialized and in this ensures that they are entirely dependent on corporate jobs for money to pay debts and on big for their food   it 's all a trap    any one want to blow off the corporations and go live work directly for our own needs on a homestead farm

how important sales people are in an organisation has been said but in some companies there is a bonus model among developers too    the problem is that it 's harder to see a direct relationship between profit and lines of code than it is to see between profit and number of orders    i 'm used to have bonuses to the developers based on 1 keeping deadline and 2 the customer response on the product   that way the developers tend to work faster and create more quality user experiences   by setting up quality guide lines that are easy to measure every company can have a bonus model for developers

in it 's current state maybe not the biggest issue with me is scheduling deliveries for perishable items i do n't plan ahead like okay tomorrow i 'm going to kroger between 5 pm and 7 pm to get groceries     we live in an age where the trend is i want what i want i want it here and i want it now   depending on where you 're at grocery delivery does n't always allow for that    but imagine they perfect it to where you can decide between having chinese delivered within an hour or having a bag of groceries delivered within an hour at an affordable price where the distribution costs are not price prohibitive to me at least that would be the ideal scenario it 's getting closer especially in urban areas but has n't really been perfected made consistent yet by any one delivery service

i will add one point missing from the answers by cqm and when you take a loan and invest the proceeds the interest that you pay on the loan is deductible on schedule a line 14 of your federal income tax return under the category of investment interest expense   if the   interest expense is larger than all your investment earnings not just those from the loan proceeds then you can deduct at most the amount of the earnings and carry over the excess investment interest paid this year for deduction   against investment earnings in future years also if some of the earnings are long term capital gains and you choose to deduct the corresponding investment interest expense then those capital gains are taxed as ordinary income instead of at the favored ltcg rate you also have the option of choosing to deduct only that amount of interest that offsets dividend and short term capital gain income that is taxed at ordinary rates pay tax at the ltcg rate on the capital gains and carry over rest of the interest for deduction in future years in previous years when the tax laws called for   reduction in the schedule a deductions for high income earners this investment interest expense was exempt from the reduction whether future tax laws will allow this exemption depends on congress so this should be taken into account when dealing with the taxes issue in deciding whether to take a loan to invest in the stock market

if the time horizon is 5 years i do n't think that playing games with roth iras or investments is really productive i 'd look at an online savings account as a holding place for this money edit   another option is the us is savings bonds the rates earned right now are poor as of ee bonds earn 0.6 and i bonds yielded and there is an interest penalty if you redeem them in less than five years but they are not state taxable and you can defer tax payments until you cash them

we need more governmental student aid more pell grants and more cheap loans   if we 've learned anything over the years the government injecting billions of dollars of free money and cheap loans into the educational system in no way changes the pricing structure of that   of that system     also we need more highly valuable highly marketable majors offered by colleges forget the hard stem stuff let 's focus more on women 's studies african studies social justice and other majors like these because let 's be honest with ourselves these type of degrees are in no way made up waste of time degrees that do very little to nothing to prepare the graduate for how the real world works     btw before the sjw 's vote me down let me hit you with this dose of reality i own and operate multiple successful businesses and hire people on a regular basis if we get a resume from someone with one of those degrees let 's just say that they will not be getting an interview
