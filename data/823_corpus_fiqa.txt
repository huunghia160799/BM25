since from the question it seems that you 're talking about the us taxation i 'll assume that you can definitely continue filing jointly being members of a partnership has no bearing on how you file your own tax return the partnership will distribute k-1 to each of you separately but you 'll report both of them on the same return

from wikipedia bezos was one of the first shareholders in google when he invested $ 250,000 in 1998 that $ 250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of google stock worth about $ 3.1 billion today   his wealth may be tied to amazon but he is a savvy investor recently i was watching an early interview he did with charlie rose and i read more about him which led to reading the wikipedia article

i 'm not going to address everything here we are politically too far apart for much meaningful dialogue    but i only made the claim workers should be paid a living wage not give her more because she has kids i have no clue how that was n't clear social safety nets can provide for large families i obviously do n't think anyone 's wage should be based on being a teenager living at home etc    notice how you defined value it is a very subjective opinion i think human lives have value beyond measure this is certainly not the case in reality and thus a mother can work 80 hour weeks yet be homeless that is ok with you i understand but i believe we can do better    you can worship the market or invisible hand that 's fine i personally find my values and ethics outweigh any allegiance   to any given system   i on the other hand find our current corporate oligarchy ridiculous this is n't capitalism this is not a free market not even close

a quick excel calculation tells me that if you are earning a guaranteed post tax return of 12 in a liquid investment then it does n't matter which one you pick according to the following excel formula you would be able to invest now at 12 interest and you could withdraw every month for 24 months   which means that the option and the option are essentially the same this of course is depending on that 12 guaranteed return   where i come from this type of investment is unheard of   if i was sure i 'd still be using the same service two years from now i would choose the payment option you asked in the comments how to change the formula to account for risk in the investment   risk is a hard thing to quantify   however if you are certain that you will be using this service in two years from now you are essentially achieving 13 in a guaranteed return by pre paying your fee   in my experience a 13 guaranteed return is worth taking   trying to achieve any more than that in an investment is simply a gamble that having been said at the amount we are talking about each percent difference in return is only about   the biggest risk here is the fact that you might want to change services before your term is up   if these amounts are relatively small for you then if there is any chance at all that you will want to drop the service before the 2 years is up just pay the monthly fee

the stock market may not grow forever there will be growth in the stock market though the stock market is a positive sum game since it is driven in large part by the profits earned by the companies this does n't mean that any individual stock will go up forever it does n't mean that any given index will go up forever and it does n't mean there wo n't be periods when the market as a whole drops but it is reasonable to expect that long term investing in the market as a whole will continue to return profits that reflect the success of companies invested in historically that return has averaged about 8 future results may be different and exact results will depend on exactly when and how you invest re what about japan which has been flat over 30 years market being flat does n't mean individual companies may not be growing strongly picking stocks may become more important and we might need to to focus on dividends rather than being so about growth dividends are not reflected in the indices please note but there will be money to be made how much and how much effort is required to get it and whether the market offers the best available bets not past results are no guarantee of future returns and your results may be better or worse than average you should be diversified into bonds and such anyway rather than only in the stock market

the advice given at this site is to get approved for a loan from your bank or credit union before visiting the dealer that way you have one data point in hand   you know that your bank will loan w dollars at x rate for y months with a monthly payment of z. you know what level you have to negotiate to in order to get a better deal from the dealer the dealership you have visited has said   excludes tax tag registration and dealer fees must finance through    southeast toyota finance with approved credit the first part is true most ads you will see exclude tax tag registration those amounts are set by the state or local government and will be added by all dealers after the final price has been negotiated they will be exactly the same if you make a deal with the dealer across the street the phrase must finance through company x is done because they want to make sure the interest and fees for the deal stay in the family my fear is that the loan will also not be a great deal they may have a higher rate or longer term or hit you with many fee and penalties if you want to pay it off early many dealers want to nudge you into financing with them but the unwillingness to negotiate on price may mean that there is a short term pressure on the dealership to do more deals through toyota finance of course the risk for them is that potential buyers just take their business a few miles down the road to somebody else if they wo n't budge from the cash price you probably want to pick another dealer if the spread between the two was smaller it is possible that the loan from your bank at the cash price might still save more money compared to the dealer loan at their quoted price we ca n't tell exactly because we do n't know the interest rates of the two offers a couple of notes regarding other dealers if you are willing to drive a little farther when buying the vehicle you can still go to the closer dealer for warranty work if you do n't need a new car you can sometimes find a deal on a car that is only a year or two old at a dealership that sells other types of cars they got the used car as a trade in

if the intention is after maturing to convert back the rupees into euro its not a good idea   generally the interest rate in euro and the interest rate in rupee are offset by the predicted exchange rate i.e. the rupee will fall compared to euro by similar rate the point at step 5 is generally what is expected to happen at times this can be less or more depending on the local global factors so on average you will not make money some times you will loose and sometimes you will gain plus i have shown flat conversion rates typically there is a buy rate and a sell rate for a pair of currencies there is a difference spread that is the margins of bank typically in the range of 2 to 4 depending on the currency pairs

if you have little investing experience you should n't involve yourself in leveraged investments or short term speculation at all   you will probably just lose money if not is there a better way to invest with a small amount of money if you have little investing experience you should not attempt to make a lot of money on a small investment at all   you will probably just lose money the best way to invest with a small amount of money is to put it in a low cost mainstream investment product like an index fund and wait and save money until you have more   by that time you may decide that leaving the money in a low cost index fund is actually the best thing to do anyway   incidentally i do n't know if fund minimums are different in the uk but in the us an amount equivalent to £ 100 might not even be enough to start so you might have to just put it in a savings account until you save enough to even buy into a mutual fund

all openly traded securities must be registered with the sec and setup with clearing agents   this is a costly process the cost to provide an electronic market for a specific security is negligible   that is why the exchange fees per electronic trade are so small per security   it is so small in fact that exchanges compensate price makers partially at the expense of price takers that exchanges partially give some portion of the overall fee to those that can help provide liquidity the cost to provide an open outcry market for a specific security are somewhat onerous but they are initiated before a security has any continual liquidity to provide a market for large trades especially for futures every individual option contract must be registered and setup for clearing aside from the cost to setup each contract expiration and strike intervals are limited by regulation   for an extremely liquid security like spy contracts could be offered for daily expiration and penny strike intervals but they are currently forbidden

there 's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor   but walmart is such a large part of the us economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life   it would also make their items more expensive two times over one because it would cause inflation that other employers have been raising wages to keep pace with and the more direct route of increased costs     whatever you pay unskilled labor the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle   look at australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high

i compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends hard to find however managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard   after discussing with many in the real estate world i counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 8 on real estate after taxes   this does not include anything else like dilip mentions maintenance insurance etc   for those who want to avoid that route you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or reit funds like dilip mentions   however they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this in terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed   we wo n't our need for real estate but we wo n't our need for food or tangible goods either   you can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund finally one of your best investments is your career field software   do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start up it 's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set or create a site which generates passive revenue again not that hard   one software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation think of a smart phone application that you build once yet continues to generate revenue   this was right before the crash and after it everyone talked about another lost decade   while it does require extra work initially like all things software related you 'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications meaning your first one may be the most difficult all it takes in this case is one really good idea

it is normally a bad idea to cash in retirement accounts to buy a house in your case it is a horrible idea because you are way behind on saving for retirement other fallacies in your reasoning    my advice increase the amount you are saving for retirement considerably and also put some money aside to save for a down payment on a house buy the house when you have enough non retirement money to afford the down payment if you ca n't wait that long buy a house you can afford it may help to think of it this way visualize yourself as a 65 year old retired person with very little income and living on your retirement account would you as a 39 year old ask that person to give you $ the amount you are talking about withdrawing compounded annually at 6 interest for 25 years with no additional contributions so that you could put a down payment on a house because that is what you would be doing when you hit retirement age would you kick yourself for making such a decision because unless you die young that person is sitting out there in your future needing that money to live off of do n't take this the wrong way but the tone of your question seems like you are looking for support to make what you already know is a bad financial decision

the first issue is if the stock has returned 8 since you purchased it that could be either very good 8 in two days or very bad 8 over 20 years   even just measured over the past year it could be relatively very good up 8 and the market is down 5 or very bad up 8 and the market is up 16 either way the good rule of thumb is that you should n't choose your positions using the returns of the stock in the past but only on your view of the future returns of the stock   for instance if the stock has gone up 8 in two months but you think it has another 8 to go in the next two months you probably should n't take your earnings as for the $ 5k at first glance that is not an unreasonable amount   if you use a discount broker the fees should n't be so large that you will eat up any return on a $ 5k amount   also from what you describe it is not such a large amount that mistakes will put your retirement in danger

there actually would n't be a need to increase prices in order to provide wal mart employees with a living wage though there is another way cut executive pay   in fact i 'd like to see a law on the books that makes maximum executive pay including bonuses and stock a certain percentage or multiple of the pay of the lowest paid employee before you can raise the pay of an executive beyond a certain point the pay of all the employees simply has to go up this would give executives another incentive to raise the pay of their employees since their ability to get a raise would depend on it i 'm thinking something along the lines of executive pay being capped at 100x the pay of the lowest paid employee your employees make $ 20,000 a year your executives make no more than $ 2,000,000 a year want that to go up guess it 's time for raises then   the main point of such a law would be to make sure that employees are paid for the benefits they bring in to the company along with having a living wage as it stands employees might get a 25 cent hour raise a year in low wage jobs if they get anything at all this way if there 's enough money to go around to the people at the top the people at the bottom also see some of that money

i disagree if nobody got their health insurance through their employer then everyone would go out on the market and acquire them this would create a more dynamic health insurance market which would over time drive down the cost of getting health insurance    i do n't follow your logic about how wages would n't keep up 10 or 20 years down the road if anything not having to worry about benefits in a particular job would give employees more job mobility causing the job market to be more competitive in other words it would be more likely to cause wages to up   also ancillary benefits of getting employers out of the health insurance benefit dynamic would be to create more efficiencies within those businesses reduce staff spent on coordinating plans and such make small businesses more competitive they are at a disadvantage now with regard to big companies with pools of employees and get more people to acquire at least some form of insurance health coverage goes up   i for one welcome a world in which our employers have absolutely nothing to do with our benefits choices and we choose them at our own discretion just as i do with my car insurance

very simple you open an account with a broker who will do the trades for you then you give the broker orders to buy and sell and the money to pay for the purchases that 's it in the old days you would call on the phone remember in all the movies sell sell that 's how now every decent broker has an online trading platform if you do n't want to have additional value and just trade there are many online discount brokers etrade scottrade td ameritrade and others who offer pretty cheap trades and provide decent services and access to information for more fees you can also get advices and professional management where an investment manager will make the decisions for you if you have several millions to invest that is after you open an account and login you 'll find a big green usually button which says buy stocks are traded on exchanges for example the nyse and the nasdaq are the most common us exchanges there 's another one called pink sheets but its a different kind of animal there are also stock exchanges in europe notably london frankfurt paris moscow and asia notably hong kong shanghai tokyo many trading platforms etrade that i use for example allow investing on some of those as well

you have received much good advice but based on 53 years investing and the first 25 getting my nose and breaking even i very strongly offer the following before doing so let me first offer this caveat i am not questioning your broker or the advice but it is only valuable to you if history proves correct no one not even bernanke can predict how stock will perform in the future maybe if he sees a depression my advice to someone new to stock investing is to purchase a index fund from a discount broker e.g. fidelity or vanguard and then study the market and economics the wall street journal and the web are my favorites i started with a hell of a lot less than you have saved i would not turn $ 200 k over to anyone until you know exactly the risk and cost involved also i would n't depend on one person or firm to advise or manage my money i like to balance one against the other i do not recall different firms recommending the same stocks one must remember everyone in the business of recommending stock or any investment is selling something and must be compensated that 's how they earn a living

basically the balance you see in your account is the amount of money you currently have a right to based on the fact that you have deposited it with the bank you can of course take this money out pretty well whenever you like or move it however you like however your bank account is not physical money the currency you is and used as the bank sees fit your account is simply a statement keeping track of how much money the bank is holding for you    the banks ability to use deposited funds to make money relies on the fundamental assumption that not everyone is going to withdraw all of there deposited funds at once all banks will have legislated liquidity requirements how much money needs to be kept in cash or near cash securities short term interest bearing paper basically in order to allow for pretty much any reasonable number of people to withdraw any amount of money additionally the bank as you said makes money on its loans securities trading and investment banking activities that money belongs to the bank and gives them even more money to play around with   obviously there have historically been instances in which bank runs occur everyone tries to withdraw all there money at once bank have enough liquid assets to pay or cases in which a bank experiences solvency issues for other reasons having to pay out poorly thought out speculative securities transactions re north american housing crash in 2008 in these cases there are consumer protection agencies that insure financial institutions against insolvency varies by country but under most normal circumstances the bank uses some portion of deposited funds to make money and has systems in place to ensure an individual person can access there deposited funds as needed    tldr account statement just shows how much money you have given the bank and can thus claim back from them in the form of withdraw bank has legally dictated cash reserve percentage to allow for everyone to withdraw money when they need it under most normal circumstances

without knowing what the balances are i associate uncomfortable with high as in tens of thousands    what i would do is 1 cut up the cards and stop using them and 2 have some balance transfer offers in hand the next time you call to negotiate with the companies   essentially you will have to convince them that they will have to explain one of two things to their boss why they lowered your rate or why you left they can collect less interest from you or no interest from you   it 's up to them   if they do n't offer you something that 's in the ballpark of your balance transfer offer then bid them goodbye and complete the balance transfer as far as paying them off the top two modes of repayment are lowest balance first aka snowball or high interest rate first   both methods are similar in that you pay minimums on all but the method 's focus point   whether it is lowest balance or highest interest rate you pay all of your extra money on the lowest balance or the highest interest debt until it is gone and then you move onto the next one in the list for what it 's worth i prefer the lowest balance method you see progress faster

based on what you asked and your various comments on other answers this is the first time that you will be making an offer to buy a house and it seems that the seller is not using a real estate agent to sell the house that is it is what is called a fsbo for sale by owner property and you can learn a lot of about the seller 's perspective by visiting on the other hand you are a ftb first time buyer and i strongly recommend that you find out about the purchase process by googling for first time home buyer and reading some of the articles there but most important i urge you do not make a written offer to purchase the property until you understand a lot more than you currently do and a lot more than all the answers here are telling you about making an offer to buy this property   even when you feel absolutely confident that you understand everything hire a real estate lawyer or a real estate agent to write the actual offer itself the agent might well use a standard purchase offer form that his company uses or the state mandates and just fill in the yes you will need to pay a fee to these people but it is very important for your own protection and so do n't just wing it when making an offer to purchase as to how much you should offer it depends on how much you can afford to pay i will ignore the possibility that you are rich enough that you can pay cash for the purchase and assume that you will like most people be needing to get a mortgage loan to buy the house most banks prefer not to lend more than 80 of the appraised value of the house with the balance of the purchase price coming from your personal funds they will in some cases loan more than 80 but will usually charge higher interest rate on the loan require you to pay mortgage insurance etc now the appraised value is not determined until the bank sends its own appraiser to look at the property and this does not happen until your bid has been accepted by the seller what if your bid say $ 500 k is much larger than the appraised value $ 400 k on which the bank is willing to lend you only $ 320 k well you can still proceed with the deal if you have $ 180 k available to make the pay the rest or you can let the deal fall apart if you have made a properly written offer that contains the usual contingency clause that you will be applying for a mortgage of $ 400 k at rate not to exceed x% and that if you ca n't get a mortgage commitment within y days the deal is off absent such a clause you will lose the earnest money that you put into escrow for failure to follow through with the contract to purchase for $ 500k.   making an offer in the same ballpark as the market value lessens the chances of having the deal fall through note also that even if the appraised value is $ 500 k the bank might refuse to lend you $ 400 k if your loan application and credit report suggest that you will have difficulty making the payments on a $ 400 k mortgage   it is a good idea to get a pre approval from a lender saying that based on the financial information that you have provided you will likely be approved for a mortgage of $ z that is the bank thinks that you can afford the payments on a mortgage of as much as $ z that way you have some feel for how much house you can afford and that should affect what kinds of property you should be bidding on

the rich pay more in taxes it would be hard to cut taxes in a way that did nt help the rich i 'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes i do n't care that much if it helps the rich   edit okay so let 's say you give the top third of the population by income a 1 income tax cut the middle third got a 5 cut and the bottom third got a 10 cut in dollar value the rich are still getting a larger cut simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes   someone made a point about property tax speaking very generally poor people rent and rich people own so a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy because they own more property certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non wealthy simply because they spend more money   but what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy such as with the headline of ops article as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich as i stated above i do n't care that it helps the rich as long as it 's helping the rest of us too and if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than i am by virtue of being rich i 'm not bothered because i can do math

you 're totally correct but missed my point   the socialists in our society pushed for socialized healthcare the free marketers resisted   punishing poor unskilled workers was the end result compromise     personally i think the only reason this compromise exists is because the socialists elements of our society have a fundamentally naive view of how an economy works   it is n't because they are evil it 's just that their total focus on social justice blinds them from seeing the inevitable consequence of their actions   it 's a similar problem to fundamental needing to disregard science to remain true to their faith   knowledge of science turns people towards knowledge of economics turns people towards free markets   it 's critical for one to find a mechanism to remain ignorant in order to hold on to such a world view which is why few people jump ship from to religion or from free marketer to socialist   it 's a one way trip   religion and socialism are psychologically and emotionally comforting and to a limited degree work well especially in smaller communities in helping to coordinate a society to bring about positive results   so i 'm not anti socialist nor anti especially at the small scale   the problem is that because both of these movements rely on a certain kind of willful ignorance their are easily tricked into working against their core motivations love for humanity justice for all   i said all that to say that you are correct in assuming i blame the socialist disproportionately but i think this blame is justified   if they did n't have such an irrational fear of the free market we would n't have such complex unfair set of rules that tend to hurt the most disadvantaged in our society most

some liquidity since you 're using ib and you seem to be an investor not a trader so you wo n't notice especially if you walk your orders but you will suffer the bid ask spread as everyone else albeit wider    if buying the best strategy unless if one is time constrained is to walk the entire bid from the best bid to the best ask   it is highly likely that someone will hit your order before you hit the best ask   if they do n't as a long term investor the few pennies wo n't make or break you especially if the price per share is 100 usd equivalent but it is an excellent habit to form and fun since you 're buying etfs even though your orders are small you would be adding liquidity to your market helping it become more efficient because your orders could be used to arbitrage against all of the etf 's holdings in turn providing liquidity for those holdings no liquidity this could only be done with an extremely low cost broker like ib because the trading commissions would make it prohibitively expensive there are huge risks when trading an illiquid security such as   would be much less risky thus less expensive securities with no liquidity can be traded but they must be traded very carefully   in the case of a security that can only attract about 20 shares per day in volume only single shares should be bid   the market makers suffering from a dearth in volume may not even be willing to haggle therefore the only recourse is a statistical who will attempt to profit from the spread between other more liquid versions of the security considering the available alternative is not recommended to trade

this is a great question i 've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 + years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me i 've lived off these businesses for 20 + years so i know it can be done first let me start by saying that the rules regulations requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally for the most part are local laws and regulations depending on what your business does you may have some federal rules to follow but for the most part it will be your locality state county city that determines what you 'll have to do to comply and be legal also though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances you do n't always have to there are many small businesses think etc that get income from their business operations and do so as individuals of course everyone has to pay taxes so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year you are income tax legal   i wo n't try to answer the income tax question here though as that can be a big question also though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below when it comes to taxes i definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if it 's something like h&r block or jackson etc in some cities there might even be free tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses in general income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing i 've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they 're required to in essence they are overpaying running a business and making a profit can be hard enough so on to of that you do n't need to be paying more than you are required to   also i am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you that you wo n't have a payroll that is another area that can be complicated for sure ok with those generics out of the way let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business since you have the idea for your business pretty figured out will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government not necessarily since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work you can certainly research this on your own it might take a little time but it 's doable if you stick with it some resources the state of florida where i live has an excellent page at you might not be in florida but almost every state will have something similar what all do i need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business   all of the answers above still apply to this question but here are a few more items to consider you will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business if you license some content stock images for example you 'll want to document receipts these are easy usually as you know directly if you subscribe to the apple developer program which you 'll need to if you intend to sell apps in the apple app stores the subscription is an expense against your business income etc you will want to keep good records of indirect costs these are not so easy to figure out and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these what do i mean well you need an office in order to produce your work right you might need a computer a phone internet electricity heat etc all of which allow you to create a working environment that allows you to produce your product the irs and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and count them as legitimate business expenses no you ca n't use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home and the entire bill is not just for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense again i do n't want to get too far down the income tax rabbit hole but you still need to keep track of what you spend you must keep good record of all your income this is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll gifts from friends business income from clients and/or the app stores etc do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit but you do n't really know where that money came from unless you are tracking it the good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like quicken or quickbooks or many many other such popular programs you will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses especially home based businesses depending on your business activity you might want to consider business liability insurance again this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you 'll be dealing with some might require you to have some insurance   will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in   this might be a legal accountant question as to the very specific answer from the pov of the law and taxing authorities however consider that not all businesses make any money at all for a long time and they definitely are a business for instance twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business again deferring to the attorneys cpas here for the legal answer the practical answer is that you 're performing some business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen i would consider acting as a business regardless what things do i need to do up front and what things can i defer to later especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in this question 's answer could be quite long there are potentially many items you can defer   however one i can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation an individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations for tax purposes this is sometimes referred to as schedule c income i 'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues but i am saying that it 's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses having said that this too can be easy to do on your own many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars if you do incorporate as a small business of one person i would definitely consider a tax concept called an s corp to avoid paying double taxes but here too we 've gone down the tax rabbit hole again

there are times when investing in an etf is more convenient than a mutual fund when you invest in a mutual fund you often have an account directly with the mutual fund company or you have an account with a mutual fund broker   mutual funds often have either a front end or back end load which essentially gives you a penalty for jumping in and out of funds etfs are traded exactly like stocks so there is inherently no load when buying or selling   if you have a brokerage account and you want to move funds from a stock to a mutual fund an etf might be more convenient with some accounts an etf allows you to invest in a fund that you would not be able to invest in otherwise   for example you might have a 401k account through your employer   you might want to invest in a vanguard mutual fund but vanguard funds are not available with your 401k   if you have access to a brokerage account inside your 401k you can invest in the vanguard fund through the associated etf another reason that you might choose an etf over a mutual fund is if you want to try to short the fund

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

a trick that works for some folks pay yourself first have part of your paycheck put directly into an account that you promise yourself you wo n't touch except for some specific purpose eg retirement if that money is gone before it gets to your pocket it 's much less likely to be spent us specific note that if your employer offers a 401k program with matching funds and you are n't taking advantage of that you are leaving free money on the table that does put an additional barrier between you and the money until you retire too in other countries look for other possible matching or tax advantaged savings programs for that matter there are some other possibilities in the us from education savings plans to discounted stock purchase that you could sell immediately for a profit i probably should be signed up for that last

the vendor needs to do this using apportionment according to the vat rules for mixed supplies if you make mixed supplies and the individual supplies are not liable to vat    at the same rate then you need to work out the tax value of    each supply in order to calculate how much tax is due if the tax    value is based on the total price you charge see paragraph 7.3 you    do this by splitting that price between the supplies this is called    an apportionment there is no special method of apportionment however your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them it is usually best to use one of the methods shown in section 32 the section 32 referred to really relates to use between business and non business purposes but it implies that splitting up the total price in proportion to the original prices would probably be fair so in your example the vendor might split the £ 5 discount equally between the spoon and the as they had the same gross cost and pay vat as if each had cost £ 7.50 gross the vendor could also do it in proportion to their net pre vat prices and thus a bit more of the discount to the than the spoon but as this would lead to them paying slightly more tax overall they probably would n't choose to however none of this is likely to be too relevant to a consumer since in the uk prices must be presented as the gross vat inclusive amounts and so the discounts will also apply to those amounts it will of course affect how much of the purchase price the vendor ends up paying on to the government and thus might indirectly affect what discounts the vendor is willing to offer

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

stocks as an asset represent the sum of the current market value of all of your holdings if your portfolio is showing unrealized gains and losses then that net amount is inherently reflected in the current market value of your holdings   that 's not to say cost basis is not important any closed trades realized gains or losses will of course have an impact on your taxable income so it could n't hurt to keep track of your cost basis from a tax standpoint but understand that the term asset refers to the current market values and does not consider base amounts taxes do perhaps consider making separate cells for cost basis but also bear in mind that most if not all of the major online discount brokers will provide transferring of cost basis information electronically to the major online tax service providers

i would make a change to the answer from if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the value of call options will go up so if you still think that options prices will go up then a sell off in the stock may be a good point to buy more calls for cheaper it would be your call at that point no pun intended here is some theory which may help an options trader in a bank would say that the value of a call option can go up for two reasons the vix index is a measure of the levels of implied volatility so you could intuitively say that when you trade options you are taking a view on two components the underlying stock and the level of the vix index importantly as you get closer to the expiry date this second effect diminishes big jumps up in the vix will produce smaller increases in the value of the call option taking this point to its limit at maturity the value of the call option is only dependent on the price of the underlying stock an options trader would say that the vega of a call option decreases as it gets closer to expiry a consequence of this is that if pure options traders are naturally less inclined to buy and hold to expiry because otherwise they would really just be taking a view on the stock price rather than the stock price the implied volatility surface trading options without thinking too much about implied is of course a valid strategy maybe you just use them because you will automatically have a mechanism which limits losses on your positions but i am just trying to give you an impression of the bigger picture

the first thing you should do is write a letter to the collection company telling them that you dispute all charges and demand per section 809 of the fair debt collection practices act that they immediately validate and confirm any and all debts they you owe you should further request that that they only communicate with you by mail section 809 requires them to examine the legal documents showing you allegedly owe a debt and they are required to send this to you this all creates a useful paper trail when you send the letter be sure to send it as certified mail with a return receipt from your description it does n't sound like this will do anything but it 's important you do it within 30 days of them contacting you this is because the law allows them to assume the debt is valid if you do n't do it within 30 days of their initial contact i recommend you speak with an attorney most states have a statute of limitation on debt of about 4 or 5 years i do n't know if that applies to courts though whatever you do be very careful of the language you use when speaking with them always refer to it as the alleged debt or the debt you i owe you do n't want them your words later on as far as proving you paid it i would look through every scrap of paper i 'd ever touched looking for it if that proves fruitless try going to the courthouse and looking through their records if they 're saying you did n't pay that 's a long shot but still worth a try you could also try bank records from that time like if you have a visa statement showing $ paid to the nevada court or something like that if all else fails the law allows you to send the collector a letter saying that you refuse to pay the debt the collection company then legally must stop contacting you unless it 's to tell you they are suing you or to tell you they wo n't contact you again i strongly advise against this though your best bet is going to be speaking with a qualified attorney edit you should also pull your credit reports to make sure this is n't being reported there federal law gives you the right to have a free copy of each of your credit reports once every year if it is being reported send a certified letter with return receipt to each bureau which is reporting it telling them you dispute the information they then are required to confirm the information if they ca n't confirm it they must remove it if they do confirm it you are legally entitled to put a statement disputing the information next to it on your credit report i am not an attorney this is not legal advise you should consult an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

one way to do these sorts of calculations is to use the spreadsheet version of irs form 1040 available here   this is provided by a private individual and is not an official irs tool but in practice it is usually accurate enough for these purposes   you may have to spend some time figuring out where to enter the info   however if you enter your self employment income on schedule c this spreadsheet will calculate the self employment tax as well as the income tax   an advantage is that it is the full 1040 so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to enter ordinary w-2 income even capital gains etc of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this but in my experience the excel 1040 is more convenient as most websites and tax prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad hoc way for purposes like tax estimation   you can do whatever works for you but i would recommend taking a look at the excel 1040   it is a surprisingly useful tool

i 'm not suggesting the constitution is perfect i 'm saying a democracy without a constitution would be a risky thing   this has been noted since 's politics   to put it simply what if the majority in america today decided to round up muslim americans in concentration camps    the only thing protecting them is the constitutional right of due process it 's not perfect in practice but imagine if it did n't exist at all    bay and the japanese camps during ww2 were both failures of this protection but it 's the constitution that gives civil rights advocates a leg to stand on in opposing such practices if not for that there would be no recourse for a minority

consider the mechanic which actually drives the price of a stock in simplest terms the price of a stock is the price at which the most recent trade occurred ie if the price of ibm is $ 100/share that means the last time someone bought ibm stock they paid $ 100 above and below the spot price are dozens hundreds thousands of buyers and sellers who have placed orders that no one is yet willing to match ie if ibm 's spot price is at $ 100 there could still be 10,000 people willing to sell for $ 101 called the ask price for the lowest price someone is currently willing to sell at and 15,000 willing to buy for $ 99 called the bid price for the highest price someone is currently willing to buy for   until someone is willing to buy for $ 101 then no one will be able to sell at $ 101 until someone is willing to sell for $ 99 no one will be able to buy for $ 99 typically orders are placed in the market at a particular limit meaning that those orders to buy at $ at $ 101 are already in the system and will be matched immediately as soon as someone is willing to meet the price on the other side now consider general market economics high demand drives up price and high supply drives down price if the details above for ibm were yesterday and today some news came out that ibm was laying off employees imagine that another 10,000 people who held shares wanted to sell now there would be 20,000 sellers and only 15,000 buyers if those new sellers were aggressive about wanting to sell they would have to drop their price to $ 99 to match the highest buyers in the market put together this means that as more sellers enter the market supply of shares increases driving down price conversely as more buyers enter the market demand for shares increases driving up share price as a result of the above you can say that all else being equal if price for a stock goes up there were more buyers that day and if price goes down there were more sellers that day on the face of it that is not necessarily true because you could have the same number of buyers and sellers one side could have simply decreased increased their acceptable price to match the other side

you just need to average out the weekly hours and income over the year so if his yearly income is $ 100,000 p.a then this would average out to $ 2000 per week of which 15 would be $ 300 per week it does not have to be exactly 15 per week as long as over the long run your saving your target 15 if he gets a pay rise you can include this in the saving plan say he gets a 5 increase in pay you would increase the $ 300 per week by 5 to $ per week

there is a lot of shuffling going on in the financial services industry i would not immediately say your advisor is acting in bad faith the dol fiduciary changes are quite significant for some brokers investment advisors who are fee based have less of an impact since they are already fiduciaries that being said your issue is still the same how can you get a low cost solution to your problem you might want to consider vanguard fidelity or another mutual fund company that can keep your costs low however you should understand that if you are using mutual funds the fees are paid one way or another fees commissions and expenses are all deducted from the fund 's gross returns   you have to choose between low cost and paid advice you can not get high quality low cost advice fortunately there are a lot of new solutions out there robo advisors indexing asset allocation mutual funds etfs and more do a bit of homework and you should be able to come up with a reasonable solution i hope you found this helpful kirk

there should be no problem getting a mortgage from a bank with 3 years in business they are going to use the average of the last 2 years of taxable profits to determine your income though i think the key words here are taxable profits and this is where the problem typically comes in for most self employed folks many times self employed people will have soft losses and deductions that make their income seem lower than it really is or unreported income   it has nothing to do with your business plan or your relationship with the bank unless it is a small community bank or credit union

i read an account of why the u.k. did n't end up with the euro as its currency in david m. 's great book the world is curved hidden dangers to the global economy chapter 6 of the book is titled nothing stays the same the 1992 sterling crisis   here 's a very brief excerpt emphasis mine as this story shows such    to the realities of a    changing world can be very dangerous    in this case the result was the    brutal collapse of the british pound    which explains why the british people still use their own currency the    pound or sterling and not the euro    the events that in the autumn    of 1992 were totally unforeseen yet    they the european monetary    world and represent a phenomenon that    continues to impact global economies 's account of the events around 1992 runs about 28 pages   here 's my version in a nutshell at the time britain was part of the european exchange rate mechanism or erm the belief in europe was that by currencies under a common mechanism europe could gain influence in international financial policy largely dominated by the united states   the erm was a precursor to monetary union   the treaty would eventually create the european union and the euro britain joined the erm later than other nations in 1990 and after some controversy being part of the erm required member nations to agree to expand and contract their currencies only within certain agreed upon limits called currency bands due to the way this had been structured germany 's strong position placed it at the top of the system at some point in 1992 germany had raised interest rates to curb future inflation   however britain wanted germany to cut rates britain was not in as a position economically speaking and its currency was under pressure   the currency band system would put britain in a tighter spot with germany raising rates enter george soros the hungarian billionaire a.k.a the man who broke the bank of england   soros took a huge short position against the sterling he believed the sterling was overvalued relative to the german deutsche mark and britain would be forced to devalue its currency and with respect to the erm   other traders followed and also sold the sterling short with much pressure on the currency the bank of england had to buy up sterling in order to maintain its agreement under the erm   of course they needed to borrow other currencies to do this   soon the boe was in over its head defending the sterling realizing the exchange rate it needed to maintain under the erm simply was n't sustainable britain was forced to withdraw from the erm on black wednesday september 16th 1992 and so britain does not use the euro today and any talk of doing so is politically controversial   therefore i would n't bet on britain adopting the euro any time soon too many of the players are still in politics and remember 1992 well   i think if britain adopting the euro is ever to happen it will be when the memory of 1992 has away btw george soros made off with more than us$ 1 billion   soros is a very smart guy

like @littleadv i do n't consider a mortgage on a primary residence to be a low risk investment   it is an asset but one that can be rather illiquid depending on the nature of the real estate market in your area   there are enough additional costs associated with home ownership down payment insurance repairs relative to more traditional investments to argue against a primary residence being an investment your question did n't indicate when and where you bought your home the type of home single family townhouse or condo the nature of your mortgage fixed rate or adjustable rate or your interest rate but since you 're in your i 'm guessing you bought after the crash   if that 's the case your odds of making a profit if when you sell your home are higher than they would be if you bought in the time frame   this is no guarantee of course   given the amount of housing stock still available housing prices could still fall further   while it is possible to lose money in all sorts of investments the illiquid nature of real estate makes it a lot more difficult to limit your losses by selling if preserving principal is your objective money market funds and treasury inflation protected securities are better choices than your home   the diversification your financial advisor is suggesting is a way to manage risk   not all investments perform the same way in a given economic climate   when stocks increase in value bonds tend to decrease and vice versa   too much money in a single investment means you could be wiped out in a downturn

is there anything i need to ask or consider during my negotiation    process based on the fact that they probably will soon be own by    another company very tricky situation you are being hired by one company and one hiring manager but you already know that there are big changes ahead what you do n't know is how all those changes will actually play out you will at least end up working for a different company   i 've worked for several companies in the past that were acquired and some that acquired other companies after each acquisition the nature of the company changed significantly some teams were let go completely often overhead departments like accounting marketing etc that were handled at the corporate level some teams were moved to a different location others stayed the same sometimes management changed in one case i was working for a new boss who worked out of the home office in another state the time frame for these changes ranged from immediately to several years after the acquisition for me at least some of the things that made the job appealing earlier typically were gone   try as best you can to ask questions about the acquisition and about the nature of the acquiring company if they are allowed to tell you the name of the company that is acquiring them do some searching see if you can find out how the company typically deals with acquisitions do they immediately let almost everyone go keeping only the essential few or do they run new acquisitions as separate divisions and leave them alone for at least a while try to find out from your hiring manager what their expectations are for your specific team post acquisition try to find out if anything within your offer is subject to change post acquisition are you being hired under the old pre acquisition rules or under the new post acquisition rules the fact that you even know the company is being acquired is good often companies can not even divulge that fact until very near the end on the other hand your use of the phrase probably will soon makes me wonder how much is definite here here 's something you might wish to read

trying to time the market is usually a bad idea people who do this every day for a living have a hard time doing that and i 'm guessing you do n't have that kind of time and knowledge   so that leaves you with your first and third options commonly called lump sum and dollar cost averaging respectively    which one to use depends on where your preferences lie on the risk reward dollar cost averaging dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing in my opinion i do n't like it dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000 do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a trade off but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up which is especially true with an index fund so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

the independent contractor vs. employee distinction is a red herring to this discussion and not at all important just because someone suggested you use your llc to do the job is a very common way to do contracting and having an llc with business bank accounts provides you with more tax deductions such as deducting interest on credit lines some accounting practices prefer to pay entities by their tax id numbers instead of an individual 's social security number the actual reasoning behind this would be dubious but the llc only benefits you and gives you more advantages by having one than not for example it is easier for you to hire subcontractors through your llc to assist with your job due to the of the private entity similarly your llc can sign non disclosure and intellectual property agreements automatically extending the trade secrets to all of its members as opposed to just you as an individual by signing whatever agreement with the company that is paying you through your llc your llc will be privy to all of this next assuming you did have subcontractors or other liability inducing assets the llc limits the liability you personally have to deal with in a court system to an extent but even if you did n't the of an llc can deter potential creditors for example your client may just assume you are a in a wheel a random employee of the llc as opposed to the sole owner having a business account for the llc keeps all of your expenses in one account statement making your tax deductions easier if you had a business credit line the interest is tax deductible compared to just having a personal credit card for business purposes regarding the time costs of setting up and managing an llc this does vary by jurisdiction it can negligible or it can be complex you also only have to do it once hire an attorney to give you a head start on that if you feel that is necessary now back to the independent contractor vs. employee distinction it is true that the client will not be paying your social security but they expect you to charge more hourly than an equivalent actual employee would solely because you do n't get health insurance from them or paid leave or retirement plans or any other perk and you will receive the entire paycheck without any withheld by the employer you also get more tax deductions to utilize although you will now have self employment tax assuming you are a us citizen this becomes less and less important the higher over $ you make as it stops being counted slightly more complicated than that but self employment tax is it 's own discussion

yes you do have to pay taxes in the uk as well but it depends on how much you have already been taxed in the us say you have to pay 20 tax in the uk for your earnings here you are required to pay the same percentage on your foreign income as well now if your home country already taxed you at 10 for the sake of example then you only need to pay the remaining 10 in the uk however the tax law in the uk does allow you to choose between arising basis and remittance basis on your income from the country you are domiciled in what i have explained above is based on when income arises but the laws are complicated and you are almost always better off by paying it on arising basis

here in the uk the rule of thumb is to keep a lot of equity in your home if you can i assume here that you have a lot of savings you 're considering using if you only have say 10 of the house price you would n't actually have a lot of choice in the matter the mortgage lender will penalise you heavily for low deposits the practical minimum is 5 but for most people a 95 mortgage is just silly albeit not as silly as the 100 or greater mortgages you could get and you should take serious individual advice before considering it according to which the average in the uk for first time buyers is 20 not the best source for that data i confess but a convenient one above 20 is not at all unusual you 'll do an affordability calculation to figure out how much you can borrow which is n't at all the same as how much you should borrow but does get you started basically you decide how much a month you can spend on mortgage payments the calculation will let you put every penny into this if you choose to but in practice you 'll want some discretionary income so do n't do that decide the term of the mortgage for a young first time buyer in the uk i think you 'd typically take a 25-year term and consider early repayment options rather than committing to a shorter term but you do n't have to mortgage lenders will offer shorter terms as long as you can afford the payments decide how much you 're putting into a deposit make for cost of moving stamp duty if applicable fees aka people to your stuff receive back a number which is the house price you can pay under these constraints and of course a breakdown of what the mortgage principle would be and the interest rate you 'll pay this step requires access to lender information since their rates depend on personal details deposit percentage phase of the moon etc our mortgage advisor did multiple runs of the calculation for us for different scenarios since we had n't made up our minds entirely since you have not yet decided how much deposit to make you can use multiple calculations to see the effect of different deposits you might make up to a limit of your total savings putting up more deposit both increases the amount you can borrow for a given monthly payment since mortgage rates are lower when the loan is a lower proportion of house value and of course increases the house price you can afford so unless you 're getting a very high return on your savings £ 1 of deposit gets you somewhat more than £ 1 of house and the calculation will tell you how much more once you 've chosen the house you want the matter is even simpler do you prefer to put your savings in the house and borrow less and make lower payments or prefer to put your savings elsewhere and borrow more and make higher payments but perhaps have some additional income from the savings assuming you maintain a contingency fund a lower mortgage is generally considered a good investment in the uk but you need to check what 's right for you and compare it to other investments you could make the issue is complicated by the fact that residential property prices are rising quite quickly in most areas of the uk and have been for a long time meaning that highly leveraged property investment appears to be a really good idea this leads to the imprudent but tempting conclusion that you should buy the biggest house you can possibly afford and watch its value rises i do not endorse this advice personally but it 's certainly true that in a sharply rising house market it 's easier to get away with buying a bigger house than you need than it is to get away with it in a flat or falling market as stephen says an offset mortgage is a no brainer good idea if the rate is the same unfortunately in the uk the rate is n't the same or anyway it was n't a couple of years ago offset mortgages are especially good for those who make a lot of savings from income and for any reason do n't want to commit all of those savings to a traditional mortgage payment good reasons for not wanting to do that include uncertainty about your future income and a desire to have the flexibility to actually spend some of it if you fancy

you can make estimated tax payments on form 1040-es   most people who make such payments need to do it quarterly because the typical reasons for making estimated payments is something like self employment income that a person will get throughout the year   if you have a one time event like a single large sale of stock however there 's nothing wrong with doing it just one quarter out of the year when it comes time to file your taxes part of the calculate is whether you were timely quarter by quarter not just for the entire year so if you do have a big one time event mid year do n't wait until the end of the year to file an estimated payment   of course if the event is at the end of the year then you can make it a 4th quarter estimated payment

thanks for including a summary for lurkers in your comment i did n't realize how quickly i was responding and i did not know you edited i appreciate you not letting me look ridiculous to browsers   to change course a little bit i 'd like to talk to the idea that if successful people deserve success unsuccessful people must deserve their lot also   outside of money the biggest thing i think we will leave to our kids is what we have learned about money nutrition health and social interaction nothing we know is secret knowledge but at the same time these are fields that are not taught to competence in school and plenty of advertise nonsense that make it difficult to quickly learn what makes sense    if you 're a 25 year old guy making 35 40k and you eat at subway because it is endorsed by the american heart association and you assume it 's healthy and you spend 30 of your pre tax income on a house because your mortgage broker said that 's normal and your financial advisor said houses are assets and you buy what you like on credit cards and pay monthly minimums and you take out an auto lease or a 6 year loan on a purchase to keep payments low and you diversify what little you have left into mutual funds and bonds you are doing two things you are acting like a totally responsible young adult according to societal norms and people who are supposed to give you advice and you are totally fucking yourself you are yourself with debt you are n't investing in yourself you 're your money 's ability to help you live a life you actually want to live and you are yourself to monthly payments that limit your ability to make choices about what you want and how you want to live    is that your fault you followed common wisdom and your trusted advisors unless you happen to see a different way or someone comes along and tells you otherwise you may never know what opportunities you could 've had i 'll even concede that having the opportunity to think differently may be luck   but here is where i have a point of contention what if you 've concluded generational wealth is simply luck by the time you have someone try to show you differently you may dismiss your opportunity as bullshit and remained trapped in the standard american day to day wage debt slavery this is why i hate these semantics so much i think they rob people of their opportunities

illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low priced over the counter otc securities with low volumes open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm basically you ca n't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid otc stock without facing a fee you 'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the average volume if you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stock 's average volume over the last 20 days you 'll also be assessed a fee the first link i included above is just an example but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client   this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits technically these fees are assessed to the clearing firm not the individual investor but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s that triggered the restriction also remember that when buying otc pink sheet stocks your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from sell to if you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future but there are n't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price or even at all

if a market is efficient then risk reward should be linear   in simple markets like stocks and bonds everyone thinks the same way and the risk reward calculation is simple so everyone can have an accurate idea of the risk reward ratio unless the company has serious problems but in other markets like derivatives and mortgage bonds few people understand what they 're buying so the risks remain hidden someone might think a company will do well so they buy an derivative on that company but no one understands risk reward calculations on derivatives so the risk reward on the derivative could be way off the price on the derivative

no the equipment costs are not necessarily a direct expense depending on the time of purchase and type of the expenditure you may need to capitalize it and depreciate it over time for example if you buy a computer you 'll have to depreciate it over 5 years some expenditures can be expensed under section 179 rules but there are certain conditions to be made including business revenue so if your business revenue is $ 3 k your sec 179 deduction is limited to $ 3 k even if more purchases can qualify not every purchase qualifies for sec 179 treatment and not all the state tax rules conform to the federal treatment get a professional advice from a cpa ea licensed in your state

welcome to the what should otherwise be a simple choice turns into a huge analysis debate if the choice were actually simple we 've have one golden answer here and close others as duplicate but new questions continue to bring up different scenarios that impact the choice   4 years ago i wrote an article in which i discussed the density of your ira in that article i acknowledge that with no other tax favored savings you can pack more value into the roth   in hindsight i failed to add some key points first let 's go back to what i 'd describe as my main thesis a retired couple hits the top of the 15 bracket with an income of    $ i include just the standard deduction and exemptions the    tax on this gross sum is $ for an average rate of the tax paid or avoided upon deposit is one 's marginal rate but    at retirement the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket i.e.    the std deduction and exemptions then 10 then 15 the above is the simplest snapshot i am retired and our return this year included sch a itemized deductions property tax interest insurance donations added up fast and from a gross income ira withdrawal well into the 25 bracket the effective average rate was reported as 7.3 if we had saved in roth accounts it would have been subject to 25   i 'd suggest that it 's this phenomenon the save at marginal 25 but withdraw at average effect that account for much of the resulting tax savings that the ira provides   the way you are asking this you 've been focusing on one aspect i believe the density issue that assumes the investor has no 401(k option if i were building a spreadsheet to address this i 'd be sure to consider the fact that in a taxable account long term gains are taxed at 15 for higher earners i take the liberty to ignore   that wealthier taxpayers will pay a maximum 20 tax on long term capital gains this higher rate applies when your adjusted gross income falls into the top 39.6 tax bracket and those in the 10 or 15 bracket pay 0 with median household income at $ 56 k in 2016 and the 15 bracket top at $ 76 k this suggests that most people gov data shows $ 75 k is percentile have an effective unlimited roth so long as they invest in a way that avoids short term gains they can rebalance often enough to realize lt gains and pay zero tax   it 's likely the $ earner does have access to a 401(k or other higher deposit account if they do n't i 'd still favor pretax iras with $ 11 k for the couple still 10 or so of their earnings it would be a shame to lose that zero bracket of that first $ 20 k withdrawal at retirement again working backwards the $ 78 k withdrawal would take nearly $ 2 m in pretax savings to generate all in today 's dollars

when you buy something with your credit card the store pays a fee to the credit card company typically a base fee of 15 to 50 cents plus 2 to 3 of the purchase at least that 's what it was a few years back when i had a tiny business and i wanted to accept credit cards big chain stores pay less because they are buying in bulk and have negotiating power just because you are n't paying interest does n't mean the credit card company is n't making money off of you in fact if you pay your monthly bill promptly they 're probably making more off of you because they 're collecting 2 or 3 for a month or less instead of the 1 to 2 per month that they can charge in interest the only situation i know where you can get money from a credit card company for free is when they offer convenience checks or a balance transfer with no up front fee i get such an offer every now and then i presume the credit card company does that for the same reason that stores give out free samples they hope that if you try the card you 'll continue using it to them it 's a marketing cost no different than the cost of putting an ad on television

any answer for what to do in a taper will assume ceteris paribus because how markets initially react when they suspect a taper may immediately change depending on what data are released after the taper for instance i 've seen soros and a few other hedge fund managers hold shorts when expecting a taper because the theory is that the market may fall   however suppose the market falls 5 but then positive employment numbers are released   what then   the same holds true for betting against emerging markets em something i 've seen jesse colombo and others suggest the claim that emerging markets are in a bubble thanks to the u.s. federal reserve the more money they release the more the money goes overseas   again this is possibly true but if good data are released after the taper for these emerging markets they could see growth and those with the shorts could get killed tl;dr when we ask about what happens after the taper we have to remember we 're assuming some things about everything else    i do think that the safest play post taper is what bill gross mentioned about bonds basically a bubble as we should see interest rates rise and the chinese seem to be reluctant to buy as much of u.s. bonds as they have in the past though some like mish assert the u.s. would welcome this   the other play i like is the vix if you think the market will fall or against if you think the market will rise   has been one of the best plays since 2011 compare it to the spy for the same time period

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

as best as i can understand your payout is based on your which    is also capped at that same $ 118,500 so trump 's payout should also be    equivalently small exactly proportional to this cap not sure what you want from bernie here but that is correct is it accurate to say that trump will be paid by social security as    though his actual income was $ 118,500 rather than his full income assuming trump does pay that much depends on how much of his income is actually subject to the fica se tax yes it is accurate however i believe what confuses you is the point bernie sanders made about people getting the same benefit while being rich bernie 's point was that trump and the likes do n't need the social security income while they 're still getting it social security is designed at least theoretically to be the safety net for people of age who can not provide for themselves thus it is not supposed to be you get what you paid system this is a political discussion though social security system by definition is based on a major principle of any socialist society we as a group should support those who can not support themselves thus bernie 's point is that we should n't support trump and the likes at all since they do n't need that money but they should still pay the tax to allow supporting those who do need but can not pay in

the banks do n't have to pay for credit card rewards the merchants end up footing the bill the merchants that accept credit cards pay from 2 4 in fees on the credit card purchase those fees go to support the rewards programs the merchants also take on most of the risk during a credit card transaction although the credit card companies would have you believe otherwise   if a thief uses a stolen card to purchase a camera from mike 's camera shop for instance any funds the merchant received will be taken away from the merchant in addition the merchant will be hit with a chargeback fee usually around $ finally since the card was stolen the merchant will never get their merchandise returned so mike 's camera is out the camera as well no camera no funds and a $ 60 fee to boot the credit card issuers make $ 60 on the chargeback fees and have no liability

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

i think your analysis is very clear it 's a sensible approach and the numbers sound about right to me a few other things you might want to think about tax in some jurisdictions you can deduct mortgage interest against your income tax i see from your profile that you 're in texas but i do n't know the exact situation there and i think it 's better to keep this answer general anyway if that 's the case for you then you should re run your numbers taking that into account you may also be able to make your investments tax advantaged for example if you save them in a retirement account you 'll need to apply the appropriate limits for your specific situation and take an educated guess as to how that might change over the next 30 years liquidity the money you 're not spending on your mortgage is money that 's available to you for other spending or emergencies i.e. even though your default assumption is to invest it and that 's a sensible way to compare with the mortgage you might still place some extra value on having more free access to it overpayments would you have the option to pay extra on the mortgage that 's another way of investing your money that gets you a guaranteed return of the mortgage rate you might want to consider if you 'd want to send some of your excess money that way

from one millionaire to another perhaps i can your fears   i am still long and continue to invest   wars   wo n't happen   trump listens very carefully to the business community and they all tell him it 's political and financial suicide   remember how fast trump backed off the nafta termination when the business community told him how many billions of dollars would be destroyed and tens of thousands of jobs lost   nafta is no tpp   nafta was in force and the positive benefits already quantified with real dollars   trump was able to pull out from tpp because it was never in force so there was nobody about job losses   had tpp been in force and the huge positive economic benefits been realized trump would not have pulled out   rent   government policy failures around housing development   there is plenty of affordable housing and land for expansion available in the fast growing cities in tx and elsewhere   protip that 's why they are fast growing   businesses need affordable land and too   debt   overblown   boomers are leaving the job market en masse and being replaced with a highly educated generation   the average college debt load is something like $ 35 k which is totally manageable for the vast majority of graduates   the typical student loan burden is around the same amount as the average car purchase in the 02 car transaction prices remain high up more year over year in to blue book   health care     once obamacare is eliminated and replaced with a more market oriented system we should see costs come down   it 's absolute insanity that people are forced to pay for insurance riders on stuff they will never use effectively lighting money on fire   policies will get stripped down to essentials and serve customers much better   high risk chronic patients will go into government programs where they belong and the vast majority of the healthy people left will see bills fall   government debt   high but not really a series   debt to gdp is perfectly fine and manageable where it is and the government has the power to write and sell them to willing buyers to finance spending   the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and will be for decades to come   the euro has no chance and the international community does n't trust china to manage the yuan well   inequality that 's going to explode under trump   wealth inequality is irrelevant to market returns   absolutely 100 irrelevant   financial returns are generated where opportunities exist to make a financial return not where wealth inequality is highest or lowest   however to challenge your view consider that some of the best returns in the last 10 20 years have come from emerging markets like the brics which have the highest wealth inequality     that 's what was said about the cotton gin the car the steel mill the train the telephone the internet   wrong every time and will continue to be wrong in the future   it 's pretty arrogant to think that somehow things will be different this time   human capacity for innovation is ridiculous   you 're arguing against a very strong and accelerating series gdp     excellent for stock market returns in case you have n't noticed     terrible for stock market returns i agree   but see my point above about nafta   trump actually listens to businesses as opposed to obama   he will tread very carefully here   market bubble   there is no evidence of a stock market bubble   trump is talking about reducing corporate taxes from 35 down to a much lower rate like 20   that immediately increases the value of stocks boosts economic activity boosts economic competitiveness and reduces drag on the economy   even better as small medium sized businesses pay much closer to 35 lowering the tax helps small medium sizes businesses the most   that 's why small caps are large caps right now   just a note the stock market is up around 20 since the election pretty close to the amount the corporate tax rate is to drop   it 's critical this tax cut get done to support current valuations   i believe it will as it 's long overdue   market bubble   there is no bubble there is lack of supply   skyrocketing rents as you mentioned above is the opposite of a housing market bubble   it 's the symptom of a severe housing market shortage   house building needs to increase dramatically and it will in areas that reduce regulations   of real banking reform   dodd frank and other regulations are on the chopping block which will help   reforms are coming   large banks are shielded from real competition by all these laws   i 'd like to see more startup banks competing   household debt   nope not even series   households have since the financial crisis and are in better shape than they 've been in a few decades   controlling all three branches of government   aka there 's a high chance that taxes and regulations will be reduced which is good for economic growth

in my mind these are quite different though maybe there is some vague analogy in meta space that is escaping me   this is n't about manipulating scarcity or demand it 's about manipulating pricing i guess the common thread is that it 's about manipulating   the motivation is to skirt the commercial code requirement that you ca n't charge people by ability to pay by dividing the market into a high end and a low end and giving the people who ca n't pay as much a less desirable product   in this case producing the high end product is easily possible to do for everyone but if you put it at the high price you 'd get too few buyers and if you put it at the low price you 'd leave money on the table   similar schemes have been used in airlines to charge businesses more by assuming they have to plan things last minute and making the high price be around of tickets and assuming vacations are planned longer out and are really being sold to a market of people with less money to spend   by controlling the character of the sale in a situation where delivery of the product costs about the same you maximize the revenue   it used to be though no longer is that phone calls were done this way too   you got better pricing off hours even though the phone lines were there 24/7 because it was assumed that the only people who must have phone calls especially long distance were businesses who could afford steeper prices   by calling off hours calling a different product you could charge less for it and thus do the only thing you really wanted which is to get maximal amounts of money out of business and non business people based on their ability to pay but by a dodge that caused the products to be differentiated so that it could n't be said you were charging based on ability to pay

what you did is called a strangle it 's rather unlikely that both will be exercised on the same day but yes it can happen   that is if the market is very volatile on a given day so that the stock hits 13 in the morning the put gets exercised and then hits 15 later in the day so the call gets exercised or vice versa more to the point the prices are close enough that one might be hit on one day and the other on a different day in either case if one side gets hit you need to reevaluate your position in the other but basically any open position you have can be hit at any time the only way to avoid this risk is not to have positions

this is copying my own answer to another question but this is definitely relevant for you a bid is an offer to buy something on an order book so for example you may post an offer to buy one share at $ 5 an ask is an offer to sell something on an order book at a set price for example you may post an offer to sell shares at $ 6 a trade happens when there are bids asks that overlap each other or are at the same price so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows betting that the price of an asset will go down traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest going long as you may have guessed is the opposite of going short instead of betting that the price will go down you buy shares in the hope that the price will go up so let 's say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company x expecting the price of them to go down you take your shares to the market and sell them you make a market sell order a market ask this matches against a bid and you receive a price of $ 5 per share now let 's pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up you instantly regret your decision in order to pay back the shares you now need to buy back your shares as $ 6 which is the price off the ask offers on the order book similarly the same is true in the reverse if you are going long because of this spread you have lost money you sold at a low price and bought at a high price meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares so when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible

bitcoin prices are likely rising as a result of the simple issue of supply and demand   supply is constrained as there are n't much in the way of new bitcoins coming into existence and demand is high right now as a result of various events for example this reuters article goes into some detail as to some current influences   mostly crypto hedge funds are buying a lot of bitcoins as a speculative move i.e. believing the price will continue to rise    the evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange but are speculating to increase their capital many describe the bubble as similar to the tulip craze in century from the same reuters article it ’s got all the of your tulip bubble chart but that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it standard life ’s head of investment strategy andrew said on wednesday who is to say it does n’t reach $ 100,000 you can see in the volume chart from that the trading volume for bitcoins has really increased and if you look at the market price you see a very similar movement however if you look at the number of transactions per day that number is basically constant meaning the actual uses of bitcoins by people just buying or selling goods or services is n't really changing much but the dollar amount is   that 's indicative of a speculation caused bubble below is a graph i made from the data from above that price with trading volume you can see clearly the increase in volume and increase in price are nearly simultaneous   bitcoin itself has some actual utility mostly for black market sellers and similar people participating in activities that are less than legal not ethically bad for example people in nations with oppressive regimes that limit contact with the outside world or try to restrict foreign currency purchases   it 's unlikely that the degree of adoption so far however has driven it to this level and the fact that bitcoin can be broken up into very small chunks means that the big boom in price of individual bitcoins causes the demand side pressure from the actual use of bitcoins to be as there is now 1/10th the demand for bitcoins from people who use them for non speculative reasons

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

9 would be an absurdly high rate in the us by today 's standards so you should at the very least consider refinancing to fix that paying off completely is of course another way to fix that   which approach makes more sense depends on what you plan to do with the money instead if you do refinance if you can put it in an investment which a higher percentage than the loan costs you than refinancing the mortgage could actually be a profitable decision you also need to consider what the bank will want to see in order to give you a mortgage on the new property i have no idea whether they 'd be happier that you had no prior mortgage that you had the mortgage but also had the cash to pay it off or if they would n't care remember that you want to be able to make at least a 20 down payment on the new property to avoid the insurance fees that requires that you have a reasonable amount of cash equivalent on hand and generally house rich but cash poor is an awkward state to be in

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

gt if you went somewhat into debt say $ 30k for a major with good job prospects and a high salary it will probably be a good decision which is exactly what i did and it worked out very well for me   there is still the opportunity cost i mentioned though the average person makes $ 30 k out of high school so that is more than a million dollars in opportunity costs if you go to school for four years instead of going to work far more than that if you can earn more than $ 30 k which there is a good chance you can if you have the talent to get into college   additionally if a career has good job prospects and high salaries employers are n't really going to be concerned about your education save where the law mandates it you can not be a doctor without the education by law for instance it is the lack of capable workers that drives the salaries up and it is that same lack of capable workers that force employers to consider just about anyone   there may be an argument to be made that an education can help as a signal in jobs where competition of fierce but that same competition will drive the market rate of the job way down which does n't exactly seem like a win to me   that 's awesome that it worked out for you i 'm just not sure it should be considered a safe or even good investment while the returns can be there in some cases it seems like the stakes are pretty high

dividend yield is a tough thing to track because it 's a moving target   dividends are paid periodically the yield is calculated based on the stock price when the dividend is declared usually though some services may update this more frequently    i like to calculate my own dividend by the dividend payment divided by my cost basis per share   as an example say you have shares in x co.   x issues a quarterly dividend of $ 1 per share and the share price is $ 100 coincidentally this is the price at which you purchased your shares but a few years goes by and now x issues it 's quarterly dividend of $ 1.50 per share and the share price is $ 160 however your shares only cost you $ 100 your annual yield on x is 6 not the published 3.75   all of this is to say that looking back on dividend yields is somewhat similar to nailing to the wall   do you look at actual dividends paid through the year divided by share price   do you look at the annualized dividend at the time of issue then average those   the stock price will fluctuate that will change the yield depending on where you bought your stock your actual yield will vary from the published amount as well

an actual discussion question i just wanna push fluff to get traffic on my blog the millenials did it   in all seriousness the housing market is all about supply and demand namely there are nt many housing being built across the us right now so that s driving prices up cheap loans also helped diminish the supply because those who could bought up a lot of rental properties since 08 so these things have caused home prices to steadily climb especially in desirable places to live such as large college towns boston san fran etc   but keeping demand in check are a few too rates are now going up and few millenials can afford starter homes due to student debt and relatively lower income in their late 20s than their parents plus they re having less kids at the moment so that s all pushing demand down especially in rural areas   the wild card imo will be the impending recession and the huge sell off in 10 15 years when all the boomers start hitting their late 70s and early 80s so there s your major volatility

in the us the title company usually collects all money being paid by parties to the sale including the buyer seller and mortgage companies and then pays out money where its due to the respective parties the seller and possibly mortgage companies housing inspectors etc   if you have equity meaning that you sold your house for a price greater than what you owed on your mortgage you 'll typically get them money from the title company but they are really passing through money that they got from the buyer less whatever fees are going to the title company itself and other third parties involved one misconception however is that if you paid off part of your mortgage over time that you automatically have equity   that 's really only true if you find a buyer willing to pay a price greater than what 's left on your mortgage   when housing prices decline it 's possible that you as the seller may need to bring a check to closing and do not get any money back they buyer is presumably bringing a bigger check but you would need to make up the difference between what the buyer pays and what you still owe on your mortgage

as others have said the decision is a very personal one personally i think you have a good idea for those of us that thrive in structured systems having a detailed breakdown and distribution of assets is a great idea i recommend going one step further however instead of having a single necessities account have a division here 1 account for bills and another for living expenses your bills account should recieve the funds to pay your monthly expenses such as rent utilities insurance living expenses is for day to day spending i recommend this because your bills are generally a fairly fixed expense keeping your flexible spending separate allows you to manage it more carefully and helps prevent overspending   i keep my living expenses in cash and divide it up by the number of days before my next check every day i put my portion of the living expenses in my wallet this way i know that i can spend as much money in my wallet and still be fine for the rest of the pay period i also know that if i want to go out to a nice dinner on friday it would be helpful if i have money left over at the end of the day monday through thursday

okay that makes sense but even if you accept that i do n't see how that 's the same as moviepass if people start going to the gym a lot more pf can buy more equipment and facility space it would be expensive but their costs would n't rise dollar for dollar with the increase in usage with moviepass they are paying the full ticket price for each movie that a customer wants to see that means for each customer that sees more than one movie a month they ca n't make a profit just from the subscription fee on that customer their costs rise in direct proportion to use    i consider some of those costs more fixed than variable though the labor and equipment costs do n't rise in direct proportion to the number of people who go to the gym sure if the attendees jumped 30 they would likely need to buy more equipment but they are n't changing their labor or equipment costs for each person that comes in it 's fixed within a certain level of activity and only becomes variable if the level of activity changes beyond that threshold

america 's economy is a war based economy you need to understand that and chew on it and admit it to yourself we are not some happy happy charlie and the chocolate fucking factory economy we profit from war human misery and of course really really bad banking practices and exporting inflation as the retarded indians are going to find out soon not the red ones we gave amp small to the ones that think they are our friends and we are going to build f-16s in their land of open and cow piss consumption   now everything was really great and we were about to get our hands on some really cheap iraqi oil but the fucking taliban we trained and armed to fight the russians decided they wanted to fight us when we attacked them   problem was we did n't need m1 and f-35s and nuclear subs to fight them   and then the bloody would n't quit and it turned out we did n't need and f-35s and nuclear subs to fight them   in fact we did n't have anything that made it cost effective to fight a guy with a rocket and a pick up truck and our economy started to fail and we landed up in a depression which we called a recession but it was a depression and that s why our central bank is still trying to get rid of that shit they sold to raise us $ 2.4 trillion dollars for the iraq war really bad investment that   well a russia was like a god send we could restart the cold war and start making and f-35s and subs again and have a worthy we would have to scare the shit out of the american people to divert the money to the military but that would get factories cracking again and corporate lending going again and nato would just have to buy our shit up   turns out it was n't a god send the were busy the boys and the 's selling palestinian spare parts and the rest of the lot getting confused about the gender and the russians were actually dead serious scared the shit out of ukraine and annex crimea .and we could n't do shit    north korea .the fuckers got nuclear missiles and a freaking hydrogen bomb i mean shit .we were just play acting to get the economy booming again and this guy had to start blowing shit up   and iran they are sure to go next and then the whole middle east   we gave the israelis f-35s even though they can barely fly .that junk has just taken so long to develop they ai n't never going to figure the code out and make it work   the god damned missile shield is only good enough for fire and   these guys are icbms and now everybody knows our missile shield is really good to look at but does n't do much did you see the japanese for cover    and the chinese damn you just ca n't guess what is happening behind those eyes .they can crash our economy like a fly yet the sit there and we talk shit day after day after day and the just smile and say some diplomatic shit they are playing the long game for sure and we have no clue what the fuck it is   i guess we are going to have to pick a fight with canada soon everybody else is so edgy and starts wanting to shoot back at us how the fuck is one supposed to run an economy when the keep threatening to bomb us   at least there is a wall between the chinese and us sure who built it have been the mexicans get the bill definitely not paying for it

chris   companies like keane ours and others know where to look for these funds and where to ask at the correct agencies that are holding this money that is not part of the public links that you have access to this is how we find this information   our types of companies spend significant time money and resources in finding out about the money then finding who it actually belongs to because it does not always belong to who is mentioned on the list and then finding the correct individual   i apologize if you think this is a marketing ploy   it is not   our company does n't even take phone calls from people that want us to find them money   only if we contact someone because at that time we 're confident that the person we touch base with is due the funds again i am not plugging our company but trying to let neil know that in some cases he is right you do n't need a third party to claim funds for you if you can find them   in this case he has looked and can not find them   keane is charging a fair amount to retrieve funds he can not find and does n't know about and is not charging him anything to do all the work again as mentioned above the direct answer is that we know how to access information and lists that have this money hidden from the public because the agency holding the funds does n't want you to know about it so that they can the funds   is the state 's legal way to confiscate your money    see if you do n't put in a claim for the money depending on what type it is and where it is located the agency and state holding the funds has certain time frames for you to get the money   if you do n't again they get to keep it and that is what they want despite what they say   that is why there is approximately $ 33 billion that is known to the public and really $ 1 trillion that 's out there i apologize if you think that this is a plug for my company it 's not because we 're not looking for calls we make them   i 'm also not asking neil for his business from all accounts on my side this seems like a fair deal

as says cfds are a derivative of the underlying stock in this case if you are from the usa then they are prohibited in the usa as has also been mentioned they are not prohibited however in many other countries including australia   we can buy or short sell on a limited number of securities cfds on australian securities usa securities and securities from many other countries on fx and different commodities the reason you are paying much less than the stock price is worth is because you are buying on margin when you go long you pay interest on overnight positions and when you go short you recieve interest on overnight positions that is if you hold the position open overnight most cfds are over the counter however in australia do n't know about other countries we also have exchange traded cfds called asx cfds i have tried both asx cfds and over the counter cfds and prefer the over the counter cfds because the broker provides a market which closely but not exactly follows the underlying prices the exchange traded cfds there was low liquidity due to being quite new so there was the potential to be gapped quite considerably this might improve as the market grows all in all once you understand how they work and what is involved in trading them they are much easier than options or however if you are going to trade anything first get yourself educated have a trading plan and risk management strategy and paper trade before putting real money on the table and remember if you are in the usa you are actually prohibited from trading cfds regarding the price of aapl at $ 50 the price should be the same as that of the underlying stock it is just that your initial outlay will be less than buying the stock directly because you are buying on margin your initial outlay may be as little as 5 or lower depending on the underlying stock

one key point that other answers have n't covered is that many credit cards have a provision where if you pay it off every month you get a grace period on the interest   interest does n't accrue at all unless you rollover a non zero balance   but if you do you pay interest on the average balance not the rolled over balance for the entire month you have to ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with your credit history are you trying to maximize your buying power really leverage   or are you trying to make sure that you get the best terms on a moderately sized loan house mortgage car note as johnfx and already noted it 's in the banker 's best interest to maximize the profit they make off of you   of course that is not in your best interest keeping a credit card balance from month to month definitely feeds the greedy nature of the financing beast   and makes them willing to take more risks because the returns are also higher   but those returns cost you if you are planning to get sensible loans in the future that you can comfortably afford you wo n't need a maxed credit score   you wo n't get the largest loan amounts but because you are doing the sensible thing and making a large down payment the risk is also very low and you 'll find lenders willing to give you a low interest rate   because even though the reward is lower than the compulsive purchaser who pays an order of magnitude more in financing fees the return risk ratio is still very favorable to the bank do n't play the game that maximizes their return   that happens when you have a loan of maximum size high interest rate and struggle to make payments end up missing a couple and paying late fees or request forbearance which compounds the interest play to minimize risk

the desire to be debt free is smart but i think the purpose of a large group is motivation and peer pressure   getting out of debt faster is n't going to work   i ca n't reason a scenario where the group 's collective power does n't favor one individual in the group over another all of the following conditions must be met if any single thing fails or if anybody changes their mind about how they feel about paying another person 's debt this plan will breakdown quickly and get very ugly   please notice most of those items are emotions which can not be planned nor controlled bottom line   do n't do it   the risks are too high compared to the average reward   if your family could pull it off a better plan would be to sell a reality show about the magical family who never fights and always puts the good of the others before themselves everybody do a debt snowball individually but have an email group weekly group call regular family meeting group chat session or dinner event where you encourage each other talk about the success failures and openly discuss everybody 's situation   this is called a support group and they can be more effective than doing it on your own go around the table and   this will require humility patience and grace from the participating family   it will rely on similar peer pressure to succeed as a single group without all of the very real pitfalls and very real consequences of a individual failing in a big group

one key to trading is recognizing expectations   what you see in the market is not always a reflection of fundamentals sometimes it 's a reflection of what people expect to occur whether that actually happens or not is debatable when a currency experiences inflation such as the cpi being higher today for the usd it may see an increase because people expect that the central bank will raise rates   again this may not be the case and the traders with this expectation could be wrong   if you 're seeing a currency rise after reported inflation more than likely traders expect the inflation to benefit the currency in the longer run finally on the economics side and economists here can debate this at least in the past the view was that there was a relationship between inflation and unemployment see the phillip 's curve   this idea depending on who you ask was refuted in the 70s when we had both high inflation and high unemployment stagflation   supposedly if we have high unemployment we should have low inflation so we can always raise inflation to have low unemployment   note that you will still find some economists who think the phillip 's curve is true so refuted depends on who you ask from what i 've read austrian economists are the only economists who see inflation as always bad long story short i think it 's paul who argues that deflation is actually good like you 're seeing other economists might see it as a good sign and it 's only a concern when it 's very high hyperinflation

as i understand it if the borrower puts a down payment of 20 and the bank puts down 80 then the bank and the borrower own the home jointly as   tenants in common with a split of the asset amongst them the   borrower moves into the home and pays the bank 80 of the fair rental   value of the home each month   material added changed in edit for the purposes of illustration suppose that the borrower and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5 of the purchase cost the   borrower pays 80 of that amount i.e. 0.4 of the purchase cost   to the bank on a monthly basis   the borrower is not required to do   so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4 of the purchase cost each month or pay some amount in a lump sum if he does so he will own a larger percentage of the house and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed upon fair rental per month so there is an incentive to pay off the bank if and when the house is sold the sale price is divided between borrower and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale so the bank gets to share in the profits if any on the other hand if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price then the bank also suffers in the loss it is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home owner gets whatever is left or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the borrower i have no idea how other costs of home ownership property taxes insurance repair and maintenance or improvements additions etc are handled ditto what happens on schedule a if   such a loan is made to a us taxpayer

as the option approaches expiry the delta will approach zero or one depending on whether you 're in or out of the money this might be easiest to if you look at the option value as a function of the stock price and then realise that the delta is the slope of that curve now as we get closer to expiry time value fades away and we get closer and closer to the intrinsic value which looks like this hockey stick as you see close to expiry if you 're out of the money you have nothing with delta zero while if you 're in the money you have a forward with delta one

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

the answer seems to depend on where you live   perhaps you already found this but the summary from the irs is the insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee therefore if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name the irs issued notice 2008 1 which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder notice 2008 1 provided four examples including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the s corporation purchased the health insurance notice 2008 1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds the shareholder would not be allowed an above the line deduction on the other hand if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the s corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder ’s w-2 the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction the bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above the line deduction the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the s corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder ’s w-2 i understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case having purchased it in your own name if your state does not allow your s corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee i do n't know specifically if illinois fits that description or not   in addition there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for s corp share members that you should also check   personally i think that it 's complicated enough that advice from a cpa or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost

a futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date   in the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined in your example the s&p 500 spx is a price return index that is it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value   dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value   since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated this has already been factored into the futures price by the market in terms of the impact of a dividend by aapl aapl is 3.6 of the index   apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out $ dividends   assuming the market is otherwise steady and aapl drops by $ due to the dividend and apple is priced at around $ 105 this would result in a drop in the index of or around 0.35 points interesting fact   there are some futures contracts that are based upon total return indexes such as the german dax and the above logic would need to be reversed

the difficulty is that you are thinking of a day as a natural unit of time   for some securities the inventory decisions are less than a minute for others it can be months   you could ask a similar question of why would a dealer hold cash they are profit maximizing firms and subject to a chosen risk level will accept deals that are sufficiently profitable   consider a stock that averages 1,000 shares per day but for which there is an order for 10,000 shares   at a sufficient discount the dealer would be crazy not to carry the order    you are also assuming all orders are idiosyncratic   dividend reinvestment plans drip trigger planned purchases on a fixed day usually by averaging them over a period such as 10 days   the dealer slowly accumulates a position leading up to the date whenever it appears a good discount is available and fills the drip orders out of their own account   the dealer tries to be careful not to the market leading up to the date and allows the volume request to shift prices upward and then fills them

perhaps an example will help make it more clear any given year   revenue   200 k profit 60 k you get 40 k in profit plus any salary he gets 20 k next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell   you would get 100 of the proceeds this is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company 's profits and reduce his pay   for the given example you could pay yourself a 60 k bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation   there should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation edit it is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly   honesty in business is necessary for long term success   i would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates   for example lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10   your profit would be 6 and with the suggested split he would receive $ 2 you $ 4 instead i would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated this allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales   it also allows him to share revenue with his staff    alternatively you could also do a split   perhaps 7.5 of revenue and 10 of profit

let me start by giving you a of a report that will floor you beat the market investors lag the market by so much that many call the industry a scam    this is the 2015 year end data from a report titled analysis of investor behavior by a firm dalbar it boggles the mind that the disparity could be this bad a mix of stocks and bonds over 30 years should average 8.5 or so take out fees and even 7.5 would be the result i expect the average investor return was less than half of this jack bogle founder of vanguard and considered the father of the index fund was a i got from vanguard decades ago quoted fund managers as saying that indexing is a path to mediocrity fortunately i was a numbers guy read all i could that jack wrote and got most of that less .05 down to .02 over the years to answer the question psychology people are easily scammed as they want to believe they can beat the market or that they 'll somehow find a fund that does it for them i 'm tempted to say ignorance or some other hint at lack of intelligence but that would be unfair to the professionals all of which were scammed by madoff individual funds may not be scams but investors are partly to blame buy high sell low and you get the results above i dare say an investor claiming to use index funds might not fare much better than the 30 year return above if they follow that path buying high selling low edit i am adding this line to be clear my conclusion if any is that the huge disparity can not be attributed to management a 6.7 lag from the s&p return to what the average investor sees likely comes from bad trading to the comments by dave we have a manager that consistently beats the market over any 2 3 year period you have been with him 30 years and are clearly smiling about your relationship and investing decision yet he still has flows in and out people buy at the top when reading how good he is and selling right after a 30 drop even when he actually beat by dropping just 22 by getting in and out he has a set of clients with a 30 year record of 6 returns while you have just over 11 this paragraph speaks to the behavior of the investor not managed vs indexed

this is a tough question because it is something very specific to your situation and finances i personally started at a young age 17 with us$ 1,000 in scottrade i tried the stock market games at first but in retrospect they did nothing for me and turned out to be a waste of time i really started when i actually opened my brokerage account so step one would be to choose your discount broker for example scottrade ameritrade my current broker e trade charles schwab etc do n't worry about researching them too much as they all offer what you need to start out you can always switch later but this can be a little of a hassle for me once i opened my brokerage account i became that much more motivated to find a stock to invest in so the next step and the most important is research there are many good resources on the internet there can also be some pretty bad ones here 's a few i found useful investopedia they offer many useful easy to understand explanations and definitions i found myself visiting this site a lot cnbc that was my choice for business news i found them to be the most while being very informative fox business seems to be more political and just annoying to watch bloomberg news was just boring on cnbc jim cramer was a pretty useful resource his show mad money is entertaining and really does teach you to think like an investor i want to note though i do n't recommend buying the stocks he recommends specially the next day after he talks about them instead really pay attention to the reasons he gives for his recommendation it will teach you to think more like an investor and give you examples of what you should be looking for when you do research you can also use many online news organizations like marketwatch the motley fool yahoo finance has some pretty good resources and read editorial opinions articles with a grain of salt but again in each editorial they explain why they think the way they think

this depends in part on the bank holding your loan and the loan agreement   some loans will accept partial payments and apply them immediately some will not accept partial payments at all and some will accept the payment but hold the funds until the payment is at least your complete payment   you should check your loan agreement to find out how the payment will be processed as well as how it will be applied it also is relevant how interest is calculated and accrued if your interest is a daily rate then you may save some money this way but if it 's a monthly rate then you would n't necessarily   either way you would n't really save very much money in your particular case you 'd be saving $ 0.15 per month = .001 interest rate $ 150 paid halfway through the month means you pay .001 150 less interest   is that $ 0.15 worth it   up to you i guess   if you 're paying that for 5 year loan you 'll end up ahead $ 9 at the end of it finally there is a kind of program often offered to new mortgage holders where you pay every two weeks like your paycheck and thus pay down your mortgage faster by saving on interest which is true but it 's because you make 26 half payments per year instead of 12 full or 24 half payments not primarily because of particular savings on interest due to timing and of course the program has to make money somewhere   paying an extra each year is certainly a good way to pay off your loan faster but it 's not primarily due to the frequency of those payments

small cap and mid cap shares tend to outperform large cap shares in a bull market but they tend to underperform large cap shares in a bear market since the stock markets tend to go up in the long term this suggests that a low cost small and mid cap index etf should offer the best long term returns    having said that we are currently in a mature bull market having experienced over seven years without a bear market   if a bearish outlook is something you worry about then perhaps a broad market index which will be heavily weighted towards large cap shares may be a better choice for you at this time with an eye toward switching to small and mid cap indices during the next bear market

how are shareholders sure to receive a fair percentage of each company   at the time the split occurs each investor owns the same proportion of each new company that they owned in the first   what the investor does with it after that selling one for example is irrelevant from a fairness perspective suppose company a splits into companies b and c.   you own enough stock to have 1 of a.   it splits   now you have a bunch of shares of b and c.   how much   well you have 1 of b and 1 of c.   what if all the profitable projects are in b   then shares of b will be worth more than those of c.   but it should be the case that the value of your shares of b plus the value of your shares of c are equal to the original value of your shares of a.   completely fair   in fact if the split was economically justified then b + c > a.   and the gains are realized proportionally by all equityholders remember when a stock splits every share splits so that everyone owns both companies in the same proportion as everyone else   executives do n't determine what the prices of the resulting companies are that is determined by the market   a fair market will value the child companies such that together they are worth what the original was

ira contributions are limited you can not dump the excess into a retirement account like an ira if the excess is more than $ 5500 furthermore as points out you need to have earned income technical term is compensation and it includes self employment income not just wages to contribute to an ira and the limit mentioned above is actually the lesser of your earned income and $ 5500 there are other limitations for people with high gross income but these likely will not affect you on the positive side if your earned income is small you can contribute your entire taxable earned income including the money withheld by your employer for social security and medicare tax and federal state and local income taxes to an ira not just your take home pay for example if your earned income is $ 5500 and take home pay after tax withholding is $ 5000 you are still entitled to contribute $ 5500 so where do you get that withheld money from so that it can be put into your ira well it can come from the student loan or interest earned from a bank or from the dividends and capital gains on your investments etc money is fungible it is not the case that only the cash received or deposited into your bank account as your take home pay can be contributed subject to other limitations mentioned your earned income can be contributed not just your take home pay

so i 've read the article in question basically it 's over   here 's my opinion i respect charlie munger but i think his parable misses the mark   if he 's trying to convince the average person or at least the average slate reading person that america is overspending and headed for trouble the parable could have been told better   i was n't sure how to follow some of the analogies he was making and did n't experience the clear i was hoping for nevertheless i agree with his point of view which i see as   in the long run the united states is going to have serious difficulty in supporting its debt habit energy consumption habit and its currency in terms of an investment strategy to protect oneself here are some thoughts   these do n't constitute a complete strategy but are some points to consider as part of an overall strategy if the u.s. is going to continue debt fast it would stand to reason it will become a worse credit risk requiring it to pay higher interest rates on its debt   long term treasury bonds would decline as rates increase and so would n't be a great place to be invested today in order to pay the mounting debt and debt servicing costs the u.s. will continue to run the printing presses to inflate itself out of debt   this increase in the money supply will put downward pressure on the u.s. dollar relative to the currencies of better run economies   u.s. cash and short term treasuries might not be a great place to be invested today   hedge with inflation indexed bonds e.g. tips or the bonds of stronger major economies but diversify do n't just pick one if you agree that energy prices are headed higher especially relative to u.s. dollars then a good sector to invest a portion of one 's portfolio would be world energy producing companies   send some of your money over to canada we have lots of oil and we 're right next door anybody who has already been practicing broad global diversification is already reasonably protected   clearly diversification across just u.s. stocks and bonds is not enough finally i do n't underestimate the ability of the u.s. to get out of this   u.s. history has impressed upon me as a canadian two things in particular it is highly capable of both innovating and of overcoming challenges   i 'm keeping a small part of my portfolio invested in strong u.s. companies that are proven innovators not of the financial innovation variety and with global reach

this is accepted law in pennsylvania however i will defer to your expertise and state that the decades long precedents are incorrect and every judge that allows cases to continue is wrong and you are correct     the internet is great for things like that     hopefully the next person in court can simply state   no your honor the landlord did not follow established law    court rulings be damned     i was on reddit and /u stated unequivocally said that what is happening is legally impossible and that the decades of precedent that exist is simply because the court screwed up     heck they can take it further to state that every lease in pennsylvania is illegal     i offer sarcasm as a response but if this was a single ruling i might agree with you   it 's well established here in the great commonwealth of pa   i say it 's been around 30 years because i 've been a landlord here for over 20 years and a renter for about 10 or so before that   the clause has always been there   the basis for today 's laws here in pa are from the landlord tenant act of   i 'm not a lawyer so i ca n't tell you when the first waiver of rights came about but it 's very possible it could go back that far

generally yes   rather than ask why are these guys so cheap you should be asking why the big names are so expensive marketing spend plays a big role there getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage it 's unlikely that you 'll see a scam a brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons but that 's what investor insurance is for is mostly the likelihood that you 'll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker investment funds are insured by sipc for up to $ 500,000 with a lower limit on cash the specific limits vary by broker with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime check with the broker it 's usually on their web pages under security funds in cash might be swept into an interest earning investment vehicle for which insurance is different and that depends on the broker too a few forex brokers went bankrupt last year although that 's a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders i heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there and that there was a ponzi ish scam company as well luckily the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors if you want to assess the reliability of an online broker i suggest the following it 's tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded fly by night scams by definition wo n't be around very long and usually that means under a few months any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface their backend databases and the interface with the markets and their clearing house the two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 + years so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model that said there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need and in that case definitely look into their registrations and third party reviews finally note that the smaller independent brokerages will probably have margin rules if you 're playing a complex novel and/or high risk strategy that ca n't handle the volatility of a market crash even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend did n't exist

my best tip is to keep getting the interviewer to keep talking   if you ca n't think of any questions    build your questions off their answers   show them you really want to know more   it works well for you in the fact that it makes you look curious   and it wastes time in interview before they get anymore difficult questions    they expect any intern to be an idiot in the beginning   it will take you quite some time to learn about the company   but the team knows that already   they 're looking for value added   talk about how you can add value   how your experiences in the past can help with any work the company gives     and make sure you learn how to tie a tie   learn the   make sure you 're   and most importantly   be friendly and say good morning to everyone you pass   everyone loves a friendly intern

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

i should think the primary reason is due why those countries have a higher standard of salary its not what you get but what it buys you in a high salary low exchange rate country like sweden you get a lot of services that your taxes buy you healthcare and quality of life in a stable country is something you want when you get old note that your viewpoint might be very different when you 're a kid moving to a country that has less impact on your finances is often because that country has significantly fewer services to offer so a swedish citizen might think about moving to a 3rd world country and find that their retirement income is n't sufficient to pay for the kind of lifestyle they actually want such countries tend to be pleasant to live in only if you are exceptionally wealthy   now this kind of thing does happen but only within reason there are a number of old people who retire to the coast in the uk at least and many people who used to work in london who retire to the south west for them the idea of moving does n't seem so bad as they are moving to areas where many other people in their situation have also moved see florida for an example for us citizens too

you 're confusing between individual 401k they 're called and are intended for self employed and individual retirement account ira you ca n't open a without being self employed you can open an ira and roll over money from your old 401k to it you can not get a loan from ira you can ask the 401k plan manager to reissue the checks to the new trust should n't be a problem make sure the checks are issued to the trust not to you to avoid withholding and tax complications this is what is called a direct rollover you might be able to roll the money over to the 401k of your new employer it is not always allowed and you should check you can probably then take a loan from that 401k however it diminishes the value of your retirement savings and you should only do it if you have no other choice being evicted from your home your children are starving ca n't pay for your etc this kind of disasters otherwise i 'd suggest rolling over to ira investing in funds with significantly lower fees vanguard target retirements funds for example or index funds etf 's and your spending and budgeting habits so that you wo n't need loans from your 401k re companies etrade is nice consider also scottrade tdameritrade vanguard fidelity sharebuilder and may be others these are all discount brokers with relatively low fees but each has its own set of no fee funds

i have a capitalone credit card and every two or three weeks capitalone bank sends me checks that can be used almost anywhere including a deposit into my own checking account if i wish or to pay taxes or utility bills etc the amount thus borrowed is counted as a balance transfer as if i   were paying off another credit card balance and it will be charged 0 interest for a year   the catch is that unless i pay off the next monthly statement in full by the due date i will be charged interest on all new purchases from the day that they post to the account till the day they are paid off no more grace period etc   all this will continue until that loan amount is paid off in full   so i either would have to i pay off all the purchases made this month plus the minimum monthly payment shown on the next monthly statement and give up use of the card till that 0 balance is all repaid or ii pay interest on new purchases    it might be worth checking on the capitalone credit card site if such an offer is available to you   if so get a check from them pay off the invoice using that check actually i would strongly recommend depositing the money in your local bank and writing them your personal check for the amount to be paid and then pay off next month 's bill in full etc

usually when a stock is up trending or down trending the price does not go up or down in a straight line in an uptrend the price may go up over a couple of days then it could go down the next day or two but the general direction would be up over the medium term the opposite for a downtrend so if the stock has been generally going up over the last few weeks it may take a for a week or two before prices continue up again this is called a retracement in the uptrend the fibonacci levels are possible amounts by which the price might retract before it continues on its way up again by the way 50 is not actually a fibonacci retracement level but it is a common retracement level which is usually used in combination with the fibonacci retracement levels

right because there was no profits the company managed to grow by keeping very tight control of costs with respect to revenue it 's not a loophole the alternative is spending less or charging more either of these things probably has significantly worse outcomes to the company slower growth due to lack of reinvestment in the business or slower growth due to not attracting as many customers through competitive pricing what they have done is become a very valuable company due to a strong revenue stream you can ask whether a strong revenue stream alone is enough to justify their valuation but investors seem to think so and it also seems to indicate that they expect the stock price to continue rising or they would n't spend that much   when amazon started i remember people joking they lose money on every sale but they make up for it in volume seems to have worked out for them in the long run

according to your numbers you just stated that you spend approximately $ 1500 in discretionary expenditures per month yet are unable to save i fully realize that living in a big city is usually expensive but on your presumably after tax salary i think you can easily save a substantial portion of your income as others have already noted enforcing saving of a significant portion of your discretionary income is the most obvious step   it 's easy to say but i suspect that if you are like most people who have difficulty saving the psychological impact of quitting your previous spending habits cold turkey is likely to be very harsh all the more so if you have an active social life   you may find yourself becoming depressed or at having to save   you may lose motivation to work as hard because you might think that you 're putting away all this money for the distant future whereas you are young now and want to enjoy life while you can it is in this context then that i looked at your other financial obligations   paying $ to your parents is a lot   it 's over 20 of your after tax salary   you do not specify the reasons for doing this other than a vague sense of familial duty but my recommendation is to see if this could be reduced somewhat   if you can bring it down to $ 1000/month that $ 300 would go into your savings and you would psychologically feel a lot better about putting say $ 600 of your own discretionary income into savings as well   now you have all told about $ 1000/month of savings without severely your extra expenditures but i would start with that $ 1500/month of luxury spending first   and yes you do need to view it as luxury spending   the proper frame of mind is to compare your financial situation to someone who is truly unable to save because their entire income is spent on actual necessities   food and shelter their effective tax rate is 0 because they earn too little and they usually find themselves in debt because they can not make ends meet   now look back at that $ 1500/month   can you honestly say that you can not afford to cut that spending

as long as your total does n't exceed the per year limit you should be able to deposit after tax money into your health savings account contact the hsa administrator for details note that unless your employer sets this up you 'd be sending them after tax money which goes in the same category as other non reimbursed health expenses so you may not get any immediate tax savings by doing this vs. just spending the money out of pocket however once there us enough reserve money in your hsa for you to invest it in the same way a 401k can be invested it will grow tax free so if you 're putting in significantly more than you expect to withdraw any time soon this may still be a worthwhile thing to do definitely talk to hr about whether you can still get it set up pre tax though most employers do n't allow changes unless there has been a significant change in your family new wife new kids that sort of thing

as someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce the whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who do n't have families thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees this also leads to inferior products from a high technology standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work would you want your ge jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers i 'm not saying it 's a bad business decision it is totally valid and smart for some markets but it seems like ge has their hands in important technology that should n't be designed like this if they want to reinvent themselves why not make a boston technology center for innovation not move their whole business it just did n't make sense

i agree with mark   i was quite confuse about the short position at first but then i did a lot of learning and found out that as long as you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement you do not pay any interest since you do not have a debit on your margin balance   this is not true for a long position though supposed you have 5k cash and 5k margin balance if you buy 10 k worth of stocks then you will need to pay interest on the 5k of the margin balance since it is a debit   since shorting is done at a credit basis you actually get interest from the transaction but you still may need to pay the borrowing fees for the stocks so they could simply balance each other out   i have shorted stocks twice through two different companies and neither time i noticed any interest charges   but make sure you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement because once your margin balance is used to covered your position then interest would accrual learn

with the position delta strategy under high iv returns short vega there is a possibility to profit from a decline in iv of course if volatility rises higher the position will lose money it is therefore best to establish short vega delta neutral positions when implied volatility is at levels that are in the percentile ranking
# 445771
changes in implied volatility are caused by many things of course and it is tough to isolate the effect you are describing but let 's try to generalize for a moment implied volatility is generally a measure of how much expect uncertainty there is about the future price of the stock   uncertainty generally is higher in periods including earnings announcements because it is significant new information about the company 's fortunes can make for significant changes in the price however you could easily have the case where the earnings are good and for some reason the market is very certain that the earnings will be good and near a certain level   in that case the price would rise but the implied volatility could well be lower because the market believes that there will be no significant new information in the earnings announcement

some people believe that inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply when the banks engage in fractional reserve lending is this correct you are referring to the austrian school of thought the austrians define inflation in terms of money supply in other words inflation is defined as an increase in the aggregate money supply even if prices stay the same of fall this is not the only definition of inflation the mainstream defines inflation as a general increase in the prices of consumer goods based on the first definition then your supposition is correct by definition based on the second definition you can make a case that money supply affects prices but keep in mind it 's just one factor affecting prices furthermore economics is resistant to so it is difficult to establish causality austrian economists tend to approach the problem of proof using a tactic establish by explaining the mechanism then look for historical evidence to back up that explanation as i understand it when there is more available money in the market the price of goods will increase but will a normal merchant acknowledge the increase of money supply and raise prices immediately i posit that in the short run merchants wo n't increase prices in response to increased money supply so why does increased money supply lead to price inflation the simple answer in the austrian school of thought is that you have more money chasing the same amount of goods in other words printing money does n't actually increase the number of widgets made i believe the austrian school is consistent with your supposition that prices do n't increase in the short run in other words producers do n't increase prices immediately after observing an increase in the money supply specifically after the banks print more notes where will the money be distributed first   the austrian story goes as follows imagine that the first borrower is a home and he is borrowing freshly printed money to build new homes this will need to buy materials and hire labor to build homes and in doing so he will bid against other home the increased demand for lumber nails tools carpentry etc will ever so slightly increase the market prices for these goods and services so the money goes first to the borrower but then flows also to the people selling to the borrower and the people selling to the sellers etc it has a ripple effect who will be the first one to have a need to rise their price these producers wo n't need to increase their price but they will choose to do so if the believe that demand outstrips supply in other words if you have more orders than you can fill then you may post higher prices because you think consumers will tolerate the higher price   you might object that competition any one producer from unilaterally raising prices but in fact if all producers are failing to keep up with demand then you can unilaterally raise prices because other producers do n't have any excess inventory to undercut you with

i do n't know of a guideline to how often you can ask for an increase you can ask as often as you like as for consequences refer to is there a downside to asking for a credit increase where the consensus is that aside from a possible temporary hard pull on your credit report there 's probably no risk to asking depending on your credit score history and especially in the current economy you may get no as an answer most often you can try talking to your card 's credit department or even customer retention department as they may have more leverage they may say yes or no or that they need to review your account when you do ask for an increase i would make sure to ask if there will be a hard pull on your report if there is any cost or downside to applying and to make sure that this would be an increase to your current credit line not a new account

having lived in a couple of my perspective on this is do apartments gain value or lose value in your area over time i 've lived in areas where the age of the building vs the inflation of home values has meant apartments steadily lose value and in other areas where they keep up with or beat inflation for most of the life of the building   have your real estate agent take a look at the market and see how much a similar apartment in an older building goes for   if it seems like apartments rapidly depreciate then it may be a good time to take a win   if age is n't a huge factor in price then it probably does n't make sense to get rid of a cash generator to put the money into other investments
