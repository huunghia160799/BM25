for sure you should get a lawyer on this one but it would seem to me that the simplest path forward would be to convert the business to a partnership where both spouses are owners and to write a clause into the partnership agreement stipulating what happens upon death of a partner   such an approach really should be done with a lawyer to make sure that it 's all legally sound and will stand up in court if needed

the quiktrip business model is an interesting one i 'm looking forward to seeing its long term stability every business has to offer value to its customers and it needs to bring unique value in order to take off at quiktrip 's rate imo quiktrip 's value is their large footprint combined with clean organized stores carrying a wide variety of products    this value is only unique in comparison to the general of their primarily regional competition most convenience store chains are regional on a city by city basis and they generally do a poor job of ensuring consistency in the areas i listed for quiktrip that 's the general trend including good chains there are plenty of bad ones where you would have to be insane to try one of the or tube things that have sat on the for 3 months   the problem is that maintaining a convenience store is n't hard it requires competent management and employees who give a half ass effort quiktrip can afford to pay for excellent management and employees who give a whole ass effort because their geographic footprint affords another unique advantage how long will that remain unique i know of several equally decent growing chains that offer better prices and if the market is large enough we 're likely to see oil companies giving a shit about the convenience store side again like they did in the 90 's after the rise of 7 11    i 'm more than likely wrong somewhere in my analysis of quiktrip 's list of advantages however if i 'm on the right track i 'd be hesitant to call them a long term winner when they operate a high cost operation in a heavily price sensitive market

i recently made the switch to keeping track of my finance because i found an app that does almost everything for me before my situation was fairly simple i was unable to come up with a clear picture of how much i was spending vs saving i had a rough idea now i here is what it changes what i can do now is it useful since i do n't actually need to save more than i do i am already saving 60 75 of my income 1 is n't important since i do n't have any visibility on my personal situation within a few years 2 and 3 are not important conclusion since i do n't actually spend any time building theses i am happy to use this app it 's kind of fun if i had that tool it would be a waste of time for me depends on your situation nb the app is works only in japan

first and foremost you need to be aware of what you are comparing in this case hsbc as traded on the nyse exchange is not common shares but an adr american depository receipt with a ratio from the actual shares so for most intents and purposes owning one adr is like owning five common shares but for special events like dividends there may be other considerations such as the depository bank the institution that created the adr may take a percentage further given that some people accounts or institutions may be required to invest in a given country or not there may be some permanent price between the shares and the adr which can further lead to discrepancies which are then highlighted by the seeming difference in dividends

i do n't have a lot of time to keep going back and forth it seems like we differ on a bunch of things but i do want to respect your final question when you ask me what i thought was wrong in that post   you mention things like the government regulating things like water and air those are common goods these can not be in the hands of a corporation man did not put those things there so man can not take ownership of these things bottled water running water oxygen tanks etc those things are man made products or services for a market i can go to a public body of water and swim in it because no one owns it i can go to the shore in my favorite suit and swim in the beautiful ocean water if i so please without needing to pay or trade with anyone for access to the ocean but i can not start pumping water out of the ocean and into a big tank for me to haul away the government needs to step in and put an end to anyone that does that sort of thing same goes for anyone trying to with the water or doing something that is harmful to people or the life living in the water government needs to stop all of that also yes the municipality then and the water and pumps it to your house in public facilities and treats the resultant sewage but are you also claiming that it was the government that created the solution to clean and our water supplies because they sure did n't   as for electricity the way it is delivered and made available to our homes is a commodity electricity is natural but just like how water when bottled becomes a consumer product the generation and delivery of electricity to our homes is a product and service if a company delivering electricity to customers in a city is using public infrastructure then of course they have to share it that makes sense as the electric company does not own the utility poles streets etc the government should regulate that   the government handling trade agreements is a job of the government we need them to do that i believe in an open free and consumer driven market i do n't want a lot of regulation on this such as tariffs that trump has talked about because history shows that could lead to the costs inflating with quality not following suit his rants on jobs fleeing followed by his talks of tariffs on foreign imports would be a terrible idea i want the government to negotiate trade deals as long as it is in the best interest for this country this is what grows an economy imagine if apple could n't import iphones unless they paid a 30 tax since it was assembled in china that would kill sales of iphones because apple would have to pass most if not all of that cost on to the consumer samsung phones for argument 's sake let 's say these are n't made in china i do n't think they are anyway but just saying would begin to take a larger share of the consumer market because prices would be lower since samsung did n't have to pay a 30 tax   as for the coffee pot from china starting a fire in my house no one would by a coffee pot if there was a known fire starting issue with those coffee pots the government telling china that coffee pots need to be a certain specification is really irrelevant the issue would resolve itself because no one would by the coffee pots once this became a known problem stores would take it off the shelves and no longer sell it we have cars that are recalled left and right car seats for and that are recalled every year so on and so forth i know the federal government has a recall process but usually its the manufacturer that will announce the recall first if there is a bad product out there it will die out and no longer be made available for purchase i do n't see the the federal government regulations on car manufacturers that mandate all tires must not fall off of the car while in motion no instead the manufacturer who is in the business of making money which they need to sell cars to make money would create a car where the tires are not likely to ever fall off while a car is in motion or even when idle   the last thing i want to touch on is the obamacare mandate if i do n't want something why am i being forced to pay for it why do you agree with this i am already paying into social security and i wish i was n't i will make my own investments with my income to prepare for retirement why should i pay for health insurance if i do n't want it the government should not be making my life choices for me i have one responsibility on this earth as it pertains to my behavior that is to respect others inalienable rights such as the right to life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness as long as i do not harm someone in an immoral way e.g. steal kill physical harm property damage disclose personally identifiable information etc i should be free to live my life without government interference i am fine with paying into a system for true welfare cases some people fall into bad situations that they could not help some people are born into a terrible situation those people need help but i do n't want to pay for stupid ass things like chuck 's idiotic idea of medicare for people over 55 he wants to lower the medicare age by 10 years this is the insane progressive ideas that literally just worsen societies in 2016 medicare benefit payments totaled $ 675 billion up from $ 375 billion in medicare issue brief the facts on medicare spending and a $ 300 billion increase in just 10 years and that schmuck wants to lower eligibility by 10 years if this were ever signed into law i am plus other american workers going to be forced to pay into this that means less money for me to save and invest for retire or an emergency less for my daughter less for my mortgage less for me to continue my education less on whatever i choose to do with my money that i spend 40 hours week in an office for my time is spent doing something asked of me by a corporation that corporation pays me for my time it 's a mutual agreement resulting in a trade of money for my services i do it because i want to do things and provide for my family i do n't do it because someone decided to spend 4 years for a degree in graphic design and ca n't get a job i also do n't do it for people that have a cash only income both illegal immigrants and legal citizens do this and do n't declare all of their income making them eligible for obamacare and lastly i do not do it for people that decide to live off of the system and are physically and mentally fit to work in some capacity i should not be forced to pay a mandate just because i 'm here breathing   obama just like all progressives normalized this breathing tax it is n't right of course obamacare falls apart if there are n't enough healthy people to subsidize the sick people that 's why the mandate was obviously put in place but just because the mandate is needed to make it work does n't make it right to force on people my mortgage needs to get paid if all my neighbors in $ i could make it work well is it right to force my neighbors to pay my mortgage nope i made the decision to buy my house they did not not to mention with socialized health care services are and that is just sickening big gov oh you 're 80 years old and you need a knew knee well you did live for 80 years so we 're going to deny that request in a system where i pay for my own health care and insurance i can get a new hip and a new knew if i needed it and it would all be done within a week or 2 most likely you have 51 week old charlie who britain and the wonderful eu sarcasm ordered to die he did so just last week even though his parents had the money to fly him here and have a doctor perform a potentially life saving surgery yep when the government owns healthcare they own your health that 's my other big reason for hating obamacare it truly is a bad thing we have world history that can easily show anyone what it looks like if we keep going down this path   i am done for now i am not trying to convince you of anything that usually does n't happen as people are set in their ways if anything this exchange of messages is for the out there that want to learn what is right and what is wrong what liberty is and what it is n't taxing people as a way to redistribute wealth is wrong imposing mandates so people buy a product service is just straight up wrong our income is a representation of our time spent fulfilling the responsibilities of an agreement that we voluntarily made with an employer our money is our time our time is our liberty and if we are n't on the rights of others during our time then

after determining your potential savings rate it is important to spend some time considering your retirement goals in particular do you want to live on the same amount of money you live on today maybe more less less if you plan on living on less than today i would maximize pre tax contributions as a first priority ie 401k in doing so you opt to withdraw the money in the future at a lower marginal tax rate if you have other pre tax accounts available such as an hsa i think it makes sense to go this route the same more if you plan on living on the same or more than today then the roth choice becomes a matter of personal preference if you believe taxes will be higher at retirement then today for those in this camp i 've seen recommendations that say roth should be approximately one fifth to one half of annual contributions where possible my suggestion would be to wager on the lower end as most pre tax accounts can be converted to roth in a year when you may be in a lower marginal tax bracket assuming your savings rate is 20 on 100k income the one fifth recommendation would be $ 4000 towards roth and the other $ towards pre tax accounts such as 401k or hsa

to many question and they are all treated differently i was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets such as mortgages bonds stocks    what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second when the company decides to pay dividends does it literally track    down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in    that person 's bank account this sounds absolutely absurd and seems    like it would be a logistical nightmare in stocks the dividends are issued periodically the dividend date is declared well in advance as on end of the day on dividend date the list of individuals or entities who own the stock is available with the stock exchange registrar of the companies to this list the dividends are credited in next few days weeks via banking channel most of this is automated what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second on bonds things work slightly differently an bond is initially issued for say 95 discount of 5 and payment of 100 after say 5 years so when the person sells it after an year he would logically look to get a price of 96 of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of or so every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest the person who submits in on maturity gets 100   for the homeowner i 'm assuming he she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from even if the bank no longer owns the mortgage in this case does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment this depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor if this was collateral as mortgage backed security it is a very different story

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

because a paying down a liability and thus gaining asset equity is not technically an expense gnucash will not include it in any expense reports however you can abuse the system a bit to do what you want   the mortgage payment should be divided into principle interest and escrow tax insurance accounts for example a mortgage payment will then be a split transaction that puts money into these accounts from your bank account for completeness the escrow account will periodically be used to pay actual expenses which just moves the expense from escrow into insurance or tax this is nice so that expenses for a month are n't inflated due to a tax payment being made now this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports the trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses one way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it every time you record a mortgage payment add a transfer from this equity account into the principle payments expense account this will mess things up at some level since you 're inventing an expense that does not truly exist but if you 're using gnucash more to monitor monthly cash flow it causes the income expense report to finally make sense example transaction split

it 's tough to share exactly what happened go to yahoo and look at the chart for cisco from 1990 to 2003 or so from a split adjusted 8 cents a share it peaked at just under $ 80 in march 2000 up by a factor of 1000 people were buying in thinking this stock would continue to rise at this pace but logic says that 's preposterous by april of 2001 it was down to $ 14 80 off its high and later to drop below $ 10   this was a classic bubble and should be studied so you do n't get caught in them a book titled extraordinary popular delusions the madness of crowds was published in yes is still an interesting read bubbles in markets are not new but can be recognized and avoided cisco at $ 80 had a market cap of $ had it risen 1000 fold over another decade it would have been worth $ t but all the wealth in the us is n't even $ 75 t so something was wrong very wrong this is one story one stock a remarkable time   yes many companies went under and the employees lost their jobs and those who were heavy into the dotcom stocks lost as much as 80 or more of their wealth entire 401(k accounts dropping this amount due to bad decisions those who bailed out in time survived some doing better than others

if you sell the property before the ten years are up the panels might have declined in value more than the amount you owe declined   in the original post 's situation this is a negligible risk suppose for the sake of argument that each year 's panels are 10 better than the previous year 's panels   even if the panels lasted forever and even if the price you could sell the power for stayed the same then the value of your panels should decline 9 per year   if the panels are financed at a 4.5 apr for 10 years your principal should decline by 8.1 in the first year a second risk is that the solar panels might be ugly or might go out of fashion   when selling a home curb appeal matters   if potential buyers do not like how your home looks with the solar panels you might not be able to get as much money for the house if you have to sell it a third risk is that the loan might harm your credit rating or otherwise restrict your ability to borrow   even though this deal does not on your disposable income a bank might think that it raises your debt service to income dti ratio   this could theoretically prevent you from refinancing your home or raise the interest rates on potential loans you might want to take out a fourth risk is that the installation process might damage your home in a way that causes expensive damage   water leakage and electrical fires can potentially destroy homes   you need to have the solar system competently installed a fifth risk is that the solar power system might make it harder to maintain or replace your roof   will your roof need to be replaced during the life of the solar power system   if so consider options that do not force you to throw away the solar power system prematurely

the fact that the government is picking and choosing who becomes a domestic shipping monopoly and defending them afterwards with lower shipping rates is in itself the problem not who it chooses   and you 're right amazon is hardly alone in this benefit     gt either way amazon is hardly alone in getting a boost from the usps ’s complex pricing thanks to international agreements through the united nations international especially those sending   small packages from china often get services at substantially below cost that puts u.s. stores and domestic online sellers alike at a persistent disadvantage   i used to work for a small time consumer goods manufacturer in the rural north we did not recieve any such benefit for international shipping their international customers bore the burden of ups rate to get items to the border a canadian customs rate to get it through the border with often a month long sometimes longer customs inspection waiting period and their domestic canadian courier 's rate on top of that and now because companies like amazon do get this benefit among other benefits given to them by our government more and more of their business is solely reliant on amazon and they have no negotiating power   this is how increasing the power and scope of government over the production and distribution of goods and services destroys small business and innovation

since there was no sale where does the money actually come from from the refinancing bank it 's a new loan how does a bank profit from this i.e. why would they willingly help someone lower their mortgage payments because they sell a new loan big banks usually sell the mortgage loans to the institutional investors and only service them so by creating a new loan they create another product they can sell the one they previously sold already brought them profits and they do n't care about it the investors wo n't get the interest they could have gotten had the loan been held the whole term but they spread the investments so that each refi does n't affect them significantly credit unions usually do n't sell their mortgages but they actually do have the interest to help you reduce your payments you 're their shareholder in any case the bank that does n't sell the mortgages can continue making profits because with the money released the paid off loan they can service another borrower

while 's yes is correct a few more points to consider there is no tax penalty for withdrawing any time from a taxable investment that is one not using specific tax protections like 401k ira or esa or hsa but you do pay tax on any income or gain distributions you receive from a taxable investment in a fund except interest on tax exempt aka municipal bonds   and any net capital gains you realize when selling or technically redeeming for non etf funds just like you do for dividends and interest and gains on non fund taxable investments many funds have a sales charge or load which means you will very likely lose money if you sell quickly typically within at least several months and usually a year or more and even some no load funds to discourage rapid trading that makes their management more difficult and costly have a contingent sales charge if you sell after less than a stated period like 3 months or 6 months   for funds that largely or entirely invest in equities or longer term bonds the share value price is practically certain to fluctuate up and down and if you sell during a down period you will lose money if liquid means you want to take out money anytime without waiting for the market to move you might want funds focussing on short term bonds especially government bonds and money market funds which hold only very short bonds usually duration under 90 days which have much more stable prices but lower returns over the longer term

traditional banks do n't put their money onto the stock markets in fact the economic crisis was in part caused by the fact that banks were placing money into higher risk portfolios and doing just that in the uk there has been a debate for the last few years specifically around retail and investment bank operations entirely   what i was discussing was in the retail consumer sector where the money comes in as mortgages amp secured loans and slightly riskier unsecured credit credit cards etc in that model you do not need to be a genius if i lend you $ 20k to buy a car and you do n't repay me my money plus 8 i get the car and therefore am unlikely to be seriously out of pocket the only thing i have to do is make sure i lend to people likely to repay more often than i do to those who will not and that well that 's something we 've got a few hundred years of experience with   if i walk onto the nyse and start throwing around my cash at put option on exotic fx markets that are in turn responding to conditions almost impossible to truly understand well i 'm sure we 'd agree that it 's hard to beat the market that 's why the investment banks who specialise in that market do n't invest their own money they make money from investing other people 's cash clever guys   so we need to understand here there are two very different kinds of banks with two very different business models and it was the mixing of them that led to the disaster we 've seen them makes sense to me   communists who think banks are making money out of thin air do n't seem to understand that and so it 's not surprising that they seem confused about what a bank is actually there for those who do get these two models must see that a retail bank is there to provide finance based on savings held and investment banks are there to help people invest in riskier markets that does not mean they are magic or evil   now they might argue that fractional reserve banking is a problem i would imagine many of them would prefer the credit union model instead but that 's a different debate that 's the mechanics and detail not the institutional need for existence

yes   this article describes opting out it is true i think that most banks will offer this as a courtesy by default but i believe that they must offer an option to opt out i checked my bank 's webpage and they explicitly describe how to opt out by calling a number or visiting a bank branch but it required digging carefully to find that information that being said are you sure that you 'd really want to opt out   the bank can still charge a fee for non sufficient funds nsf and whoever was expecting the payment may also charge you late fees and service fees   it 's much better just to make sure that you do n't overdraw through careful planning

in australia we have a 50 capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months whether it is in shares property or other assets the main reason is to encourage people to invest long term instead of speculating or trading the government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor so rewards people it sees taking the lower risk long term view in my opinion long term investing short term trading and speculation can all be risky for someone who is in the financial markets and the first rule of investing should be to consider the asset itself and not the tax implications

down payment emphatically avoid pmi if at all possible it 's pouring money down the drain do 20 down if you can or pay off enough to bring you above 20 and ask for pmi to be removed as soon as you can beyond that it 's a matter of how much risk you want to accept and how long you 'll own the place and you 'll have to run the numbers for the various alternatives allowing for uncertainty in your investments to guide your decision do not assume you will be able to make a profit when you sell the house that 's the mistake which left many people under water and/or foreclosed on do not assume that you will be able to sell it quickly it can take a year of more do not assume immediate or 100 occupancy it you rent it out see many other answers here for more realistic numbers and remember that running a rental is a business and has ongoing costs and hassles you can contract those out but then you lose a good percentage of the rent income double mortgage is another great way to dig yourself into a financial hole it can be a bigger cost than the pmi it tries to dodge and is definitely a bigger risk do n't

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

assuming you are in the us and are an average joe the answer to your question is no investment costs do not reduce your taxable income for the year you make the investment they do factor in to the cost basis of your investment and so will affect your taxes in the year you sell the investment if you want to reduce your taxable income you could contribute the $ 5000 to a traditional ira or 401k assuming you qualify depending on where the account is held you may then be able to use that $ 5k to purchase stock in the company you are interested in the stock would be held in your ira or 401k account and would be subject to more restrictions than a normal brokerage account

looking at some large lotto games out there it seems that the lump sum cash option comes in at anywhere from about 50 to 70 percent of the jackpot amount sum of annual payouts typically over 20 to 30 years i 'm a fan of the phrase money today is better than money tomorrow   there 's no telling how laws will change taxes will change if inflation will skyrocket if you 'll die early if you or a family member will encounter a life changing event etc   by taking the lump sum option you trade a percentage of the winnings for the risk of the future unknowns   how much are those unknowns worth to you the tax implications are something else to consider   in your example of a small jackpot with $ 50,000 annual payouts it 's likely that you could still avoid the highest tax bracket each year whereas taking the lump sum would be taxed at the highest rate 35 of the amount above $ for a single filer in 2010   however this might not make much of a difference for large jackpots with higher annual payouts with the lump sum option you also have a greater potential of investment returns and losses since you can put all the money to work for you right away   it also allows you to purchase larger assets sooner if that 's something that interests you in the end i 'd say the reduced risk and the higher return potential of the lump sum option is well worth the reduced payout   i 'd also suggest not playing the lottery

some index funds offer lower expense ratios to those who invest large amounts of money for example vanguard offers admiral shares of many of its mutual funds including several index funds to individuals who invest more than $ 50 k or $ 100 k and these shares have lower expense ratios than the investor shares in the fund there are institutional shares designed for investments by pension plans 401k plans of large companies etc which have even lower expenses than admiral shares individuals working for large companies sometimes get access to institutional shares through their 401k plans   thus there is something to gained by investing in just one index fund for a particular index that offers lower expense ratios for large investments instead of diversifying into several index funds all tracking the same index of course this advantage might be offset by failure to track the index closely but this tracking should be monitored not on a daily basis but over much longer periods of time to test whether your favorite fund is trailing the index by far more than its competitors with larger expense ratios remember that the net asset value nav published by each mutual fund after the markets close already take into account the expense ratio

not unless you have something else to put up as collateral the bank wants a basic assurance that you 're not going to immediately move the money to the caymans and disappear 999 times out of 1000 the collateral for a home mortgage is the home itself which you would n't be able to take with you if you decided to disappear so signing up for a 30 year mortgage on a nonexistent house is probably going to get you laughed out of the bank it 's sometimes possible to negotiate something else as collateral you may for instance have a portfolio of securities worth the loan principal that you can put in escrow for the term of the loan the securities will stay in your name and make you money but if you default on the loan the bank goes to the escrow company and takes the portfolio for their own the bank will consider the risk of value loss on the securities in the portfolio and may ask for a higher collateral value or only allow a lower loan amount in all cases it 's usually a bad idea to go into long term personal debt just to get cheap money that you can use to beat the interest rate with some business plan or investment if you have a business plan take that to the bank with an llc and ask for a business loan the business itself if the plan is sound should become valuable and the terms of business loans take that into account allowing for a shrinking collateral transferring the initial personal risk of the loan to the business

keep in mind that by fully paying off one of your loans you will reduce your minimum repayments this will make you feel richer than you actually are this will make you buy stuff that it seems like you can afford probably putting some of it on credit as you ca n't actually afford this this will leave you in a years time with the same amount of debt you have now or more but with a slightly bigger tv assuming your home loan has no penalties for paying off extra then put all 11k into there to keep your monthly repayments as high as possible

in the us it is perfectly legal to execute what you 've described however since you seem to be bullish on the stock why sell how do you know the price will continue downwards aside from the philosophical reasoning there can be significant downside to selling shares when you 're expecting to repurchase them in the near future i.e. you will lose your cost basis date which determines whether or not your trade is short term less than 1 year or long term this cost basis term will begin once you repurchase the shares if you are trying to tax harvest and match against some short term gains tax loss harvesting prior to long term treatment may be suitable otherwise your reasoning and reconsider the sale at all since you are bullish remember if you could pick where stock prices are headed in the short term with any degree of certainty you are literally one of a kind on this planet   in addition do remember that in a tax deferred account e.g. ira the term of your trade is typically meaningless but your philosophical reasoning for selling should still be examined

there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales   if you sell it for $ 107 k then that 's the current functional definition of its worth   there is not extra money to be had because you sold it for less than it was worth   if the buyer is able to flip it for more then the value of the house effectively went up and he will pocket the difference when he sells it edit this turned out to be unexpectedly controversial so let me be more precise in my answer   i think this is important because it seems like many people misunderstand equity and how it figures or does n't into the value of their home which then leads to significant confusion and errors in what 's many people 's largest single investment at any given time there are several possible ways to put a dollar value on your home   a non exclusive list that includes some of these obviously are more official than others it would not be strange for these different values to vary by quite a bit at any given time this is what i meant in my original answer when i said there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales the interesting thing and what i meant in my original answer when i wrote current functional definition of its worth is that none of these factor directly into the transaction that the op described of selling his house except for the last   using the numbers from the op 's example that means the $   wherever the op got the number $ 155 k either from one of the options on my list above or somewhere else it wo n't be directly part of the sale between him and his friend for completeness with a nod to eric 's comments on my original answer some of these numbers may indirectly influence the sale   for example the buyer typically wo n't be able to get a mortgage for a value greater than the appraised value of the house and so that might influence what he 's willing and able to bid   there may also be tax consequences if the price is artificially low like say a gift   as further below however that 's not directly relevant to answering the op 's stated question now the op seemed to believe that there is an extra $ 48 k in cash up for grabs in this scenario   that comes from the $ 155 k value that the op claims his house has and the $ 107 k price of the actual proposed sale   this is a complete misconception   when the buyer and seller sit down at closing and the title agent sums up who owes and who receives cash in this transaction the $ 155 k theoretical value will not enter into the calculation and therefore no one will pocket it subsequently however after the buyer takes possession he may sell it   if it 's true that he got a deal on the transaction at $ 107 k then he maybe able to flip it and turn a profit   but if that happens it will be in a completely separate subsequent transaction even if you look to this hypothetical second sale however the $ 155 k does n't really figure   the new owner will have to find his own buyer and they will have to agree on a price   that might happen to be $ 155 k but there 's no real reason to believe that it will or it wo n't

of the two an option is a more reliable but more expensive means to get rid of a stock as sdg said a put option is basically an insurance policy on the stock you pay a certain price for the contract itself which locks in a sale price up to a particular future date if the stock depreciates significantly you exercise the option and get the contract price otherwise you let the contract expire and keep the stock long term these are bad bets as each expired contract will offset earnings but if you foresee a near term steep drop in the stock price but are n't quite sure a put option is good peace of mind a sell stop order is generally cheaper but less reliable you set a trigger price say a loss of 10 of the stock 's current value if that threshold is reached the stop order becomes a sell order and the broker will sell the stock on the market take his commission or a fixed price depending on your broker and you get the rest however there has to be a buyer willing to buy at that price at the moment the trigger fires if a stock has lost 10 rapidly it 's probably on the way down hard and the order might not complete until you realize a 12 loss or a 15 or even 20 a sell stop limit a combination stop order and limit order allows you to say that you want to sell if the stock drops to $ x but not sell if it drops below $ x y. this allows you to limit realized losses by determining a band within which it should be sold and not to sell above or below that price these are cheaper because you only pay for the order if it is executed successfully if you never need it it 's free or very cheap some brokers will charge a token service fee to maintain a stop or stop limit however if the price drops very quickly or you specify too narrow a band the stock can drop through that band too quickly to execute the sell order and you end up with a severely depreciated stock and an unexercised order this can happen if the company whose stock you own buys another company very quickly both stocks will adjust the buying company will often plummet inside a few seconds after news of the merger is announced based on the steep drop in working capital and/or the infusion of a large amount of new stock in the buying company to cover the equity of the purchased company you end up with devalued stock and a worthless option but one company buying another is not usually reason to sell if the purchase is a good idea their stock will recover another option which may be useful to you is a swaption this basically amounts to buying a put option on one financial instrument and a call on another rolled into one option contract specifying a swap this allows you to pick something you think would rise if your stock fell and exchange your stock for it at your option for example say the stock on which you buy this swaption is an airline stock and you contract the option to swap for oil if oil surges the airline 's stock will tank sharply and you win both ways avoiding loss and realizing a gain you 'd also win if either half of this option realized a gain over the option price oil could surge or the airline could tank and you could win you could even do this naked since its your option if the airline 's stock tanks you buy it at the crashed price to exercise the option and then do so the downside is a higher option cost the seller will be no fool so if your position appears to be likely anyone who 'd bet against you by selling you this option will want a pretty high return

yes two years after your first contribution to the simple ira you can roll it to a traditional ira   you can still contribute pre tax but the mechanism will be slightly different since with an employer plan the contribution was automatically deducted from your paycheck   with an individual plan you make the contributions yourself and then get a tax deduction when you file   since contributions to traditional and roth iras combined are capped at $ 5,500 if you 're under 50 some sort of employer sponsored plan might be better from a contribution standpoint if your institution offers some sort of plan other than a 401(k you might still want to roll to a traditional ira since you will have much more flexibility in the investments you choose on the flip side if that thought is overwhelming having a smaller set of options might be better for your peace of mind

even for those of us who are n't at risk of over drafting direct debit is a less than stellar option direct debit is a great way to begin ignoring how large your bills are by explicitly paying them through my bank 's online billpay i notice immediately when a bill is larger than it ought to be this is often caused by a billing error in which case i 've found it far easier to resolve disputes when the money is still in my hands it 's significantly harder to convince an internet provider cell phone service or utility to reverse an incorrect charge after it 's been paid than it is before the other times it 's because i 've been using the service more than normal for example sending text messages more frequently or using more electricity explicitly paying these bills makes me realize upfront that there 's been a change in my behavior and i can either reduce my expenses or accept the higher cost for higher service my own experience leads me to believe that paying your bills automatically every month is a great way to ignore these events and leak money like a online bill pay makes doing this as trivial as i could hope for and the risk of missing a payment is essentially nil

since you are not paying the full balance off each month you are carrying a balance from month to month that balance is being charged some interest rate x. with a balance transfer the new credit card pays off that balance as a result you now have a balance of the same amount plus any processing charges on the new credit card hence the balance has transferred from the old to the new and you now pay the new credit card ideally you do this because the new credit card is offering a reduced interest rate saving you money though be warned often that transfer rate is a limited time deal and any left over after the window expires will be charged the higher rate

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

stop orders and stop limit orders typically do not execute during extended hours after the general market session has closed stop orders are market orders and market orders especially are not executed during extended hours although there are exceptions because a broker can say one thing and do another thing with the way order types are presented to customers vs what their programming actually does the regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist so you need to ask the broker what their practices are orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions different orders would have to be made during the extended session your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price so a stop limit would actually be worse here because a stop limit will create a limit order which may never get hit since it is above the best bid best ask

okay i think i managed to find the precise answer to this problem it involves solving a non linear exponential equation but i also found a good approximate solution using the taylor series see below for a spreadsheet you can use let 's start by defining the growth factors per period for money in the bank and money invested    now let s be the amount ready to be invested after periods so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods that is   the key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered so let 's introduce a new variable t = the total number of time periods elapsed so if money is ready to invest every periods there will be separate investments and the future value of the investments will be   this formula is exact in the case of integer t and n and a good approximation when t and n are not substituting s we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n   fortunately only a couple of terms in fv depend on n so we can find the derivative after some effort   equating the derivative to zero we can remove the denominator and assuming t is greater than zero we can divide by the constant t   to simplify the equation we can define some extra     then we can define a function f(n and write the equation as   note that g and r are all constant from here there are two options use newton 's method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of f(n this can be done in a number of software packages like matlab etc or by using a graphics calculator solve approximately using a taylor series polynomial i will use this method here the taylor series of f(n around is   the series to the first three terms we get a polynomial with constant coefficients   using r g and defined above let and be the coefficients of the taylor series for f(n     then   n should be rounded to the nearest whole number to be certain check the values above and below n using the formula for fv using the example from the question for example i might put aside $ 100 every week to invest into a stock    with an expected growth of 9 p.a but brokerage fees are $    for how many weeks should i accumulate the $ 100 before investing if i    can put it in my high interest bank account at 4 p.a until then using newton 's method to find roots of f(n above we get n = using the closed form approximate solution we get n = checking this against the fv with t = evenly divisible by each n + 1 tested therefore you should wait for n = 14 periods keeping that money in the bank investing it together with the money in the next period so you will make an investment every 14 + 1 = 15 weeks here 's one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet stackexchange does n't allow tables in their syntax at this time so i 'll show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste formulae   copy and paste column a copy and paste column b results   remember n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank so you will want to invest every weeks in this case every 15 weeks

sounds you need to read up on s corp structures i think this would benefit you if you generate income even after you physically stopped working which is incomes from membership fees royalties of customer revenue middle man etc   under the you as the sole member must earn a wage that fair and at current market value you pay social security and medicare on this wage the interesting thing here is that an can pay out earning dividends   without having to pay payroll taxes but the catch is that you as the sole employee must earn a fair wage    as for paying the other member you may want to look into 1099 contract work plus a finders fee the 1099 hourly wage does not require you to pay medicare and ss    the common fee i 'm used to is 5 of gross invoice then you would pay her an hourly wage the company then bills these hours multiplied by 2 or 3 or whatever you think is fair to the client deduct expenses from this and that 's your profit    example contractor brings client a which is estimated as a   100 hour project with $ 100 cost in supplies and requires 2 hours of your time $    you quote 100 hours $ 50 to client client agrees and gives you down payment    you then present the contract work to your contractor they complete the work in 100 hours and bill you at $ 25    you pay your contractor 2500 plus the 5 $ 250   and your company earns $ 5000 2500 100 80   and you 'll earn $ 80 minus the payroll tax    then at the end of the quarter or year or however you want to do earning payouts your will write you a check for $ or whatever earning you want to take this is then taxed at your income tax bracket    one thing to keep in mind is what is preventing this other person from becoming your competition a partnership would be great motivation to try and bring in as much work under the llc but if you start people then they 'll just keep the work and cut you out

yes asset inflation is still inflation    economy = consumption + investment + government net exports    so you increase the money supply to the wealthy what happens not in increase in consumption their basic needs are met so they invest it everyone invests their extra money what happens price goes up for stock and real estate while the yield on those investments goes down you have people buying really expensive assets with great leverage because their is no alternative so inflation has increased you are just to poor to notice it    we also live on a deflationary world production increases while demand remains constant so what happens price goes down and marginal companies go out of business leading to more consolidation lower prices due to greater market share more companies can not compete and the cycle continues    the only inflation comes from overseas where you have growing economies here we have almost no population or wage growth so that is deflationary

this is more clearly defined in the eitc for purposes of the earned income tax credit then no it is not earned income   see publication page 18 specifically scholarship or fellowship grants not reported on a form a scholarship or fellowship grant that was n't reported to you on a form w-2 is n't considered earned income for the earned income credit further form describes unearned income and explicitly includes scholarships again not on for form unearned income includes all taxable    income other than earned income as defined later    unearned income includes taxable interest ordinary    dividends capital gains including capital gain    distributions rents royalties etc it also includes taxable    social security benefits pension and annuity income    taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on    form w-2 unemployment compensation alimony and    income other than earned income received as the    beneficiary of a trust so unless it was reported on a w-2 i.e. it 's for some sort of employment it 's not considered earned income   h t for that link the definition on the instructions of form is not particularly different though it 's more general earned income includes wages tips and other amounts received for personal services performed   scholarships do n't seem to fit any more into that so i would say they do not

generally just giving a bank account number does not cause damage it depends on what other information the user has and the country you are in   generally bank take telephone instruction for certain non transactional activities and they would authenticate you by asking account number address date of birth and some additional info in today 's world this info can be pretty easily accessible for example facebook or a details posted on etc it is best avoided to give the bank account details unless you are sure of the person   typical other misuse is using your bank account to launder black money the typical is transfer funds to you and then ask you to transfer it elsewhere at times its also a scam and you loose money as they trick you in sending money before you receive it

quick answer when it comes to fixed income assets whether rental real estate or government bonds it 's unusual for highly leveraged assets to yield less than the same asset unleveraged or lowly leveraged   this is especially so in countries where interest costs are tax deductible if we exclude capital losses i.e. the property sells in future at a price less than it was purchased or net rental income that does n't keep up with maintenance regulatory taxation inflation and or other costs there is one primary scenario where higher leverage results in lower yields compared to lower leverage even if rental income keeps up with non funding costs   this occurs when variable rate financing is used and rates substantially increase explanation borrowers and lenders in different countries have different mortgage rate customs   some are more likely to have long term fixed rates some prefer variable rates and others are a hybrid i.e. fixed for a few years and then become variable if variable rates are used for a mortgage and the reference rates increase substantially as they did in the us during the 1970s the borrower can easily become upside down i.e. owe more on the mortgage than the property is then worth and have mortgage service costs that exceed the net rental income   some of those costs are n't easy to pass along to renters even when there are periodic lease or base rent increases referencing inflation rates   central banks set policies for what would be the lowest short term rates in a country that has such a bank   private sector rates are established broadly by supply and demand for credit and can thus diverge markedly from central bank rates over time the higher finance carrying cost to net rental income ratio should as 1 rental market prices change to reflect the costs and 2 the landlord can reinvest his net rental income at a higher rate   in the short term though this can result in the landlord having to eat the costs making his yield on his leveraged fixed income asset less than what he would have without leverage even if the property was later sold at same price regardless of financing method = = = = = = = = = = interestingly and on the flip side this is one of the quirks in finance where an accounting liability can become at least in part an economic asset   if a landlord borrows at a high loan to value ratio for a fixed interest rate for the life of the mortgage and rates variable and fixed were to increase substantially the difference between his original rate and the present rates accrues to him if he 's able to sell the property with the loan attached which is not uncommon for commercial industrial and sometimes municipal real estate the buyer will be assuming a liability with a lower carrying cost than his present alternatives and will hence pay a higher price for the property than if it were unleveraged with long term rates in many economically advanced countries at historic lows if a borrower today were to take a long term fixed rate loan and rates shortly after increased substantially he may have an instant profit in this scenario even if his property has n't increased in value

first i must say that i 'm not a ramsey fan sometimes loans will make your financial situation significantly better especially if its a 0 loan generally i do think that leveraging has its place its the ab use of loans what causes problems not the use re your question you 're right in trying to first build up an emergency fund you should have enough in it to be able to pay for yourself for at least half a year of unemployment or zero income you only have one month your family member gave you money for free which is admirable but i 'm sure there 's a limit to everyone 's generosity and he might not give it to you for free again once you pay it off thus you should be able to handle your future troubles on your own and emergency fund is a crucial part of this pay as agreed try not to be late and you 'll pay the loan off within 3 years if you accumulate enough emergency fund and you still have some extra left pay some extra on the loan in order to pay it off early do make sure you take full advantage of the employer 's 401k match this has imho much higher priority than paying off the 0 loan early

the risk besides the extra interest is that you might be upside down on the loan because the car loses value the moment you drive off the lot the slower you pay it off the longer it takes to get the loan balance below the resale value of course if you have a significant down payment the risk of being upside down is not as great even buying a used car does n't help because if you try to sell it back to the dealer the next week they wo nt give you the full price you paid some people try and split the difference get the longer term loan but then pay it off as quickly as the shorter term loan yes the interest rate is higher but if you need to drop the payment back to the required level you can do so

i 'll tackle number 2 it 's one which many academics dismissed as an impossibility after all how could that be rational what could cause negative yields ie effectively giving an entity cash and paying for the privilege of doing so is something we 've experiencing currently fear back in the financial crisis investors were actually paying to store their cash in treasuries because of the   fear that if they left it with a bank they might not get it back    what about the fdic insurance you may ask quite logically the problem is that we 're talking about massive entities like pension funds asset managers corporations who normally would store some think millions billions in cash and cash equivalents bank accounts money market funds short term paper they really are n't protected so they do what turns out to be the rational thing which is pay a premium on safe assets ie us gov't bills to guarantee you get most of your money back   the same thing is currently happening with german front end paper as europeans pull their money out of banks periphery assets and search for safety   hope that helped

if anyone could reliably pick winners they could make more money by investing in those winners than by selling their advice generally when someone sends you unsolicited hype about stocks that 's because they 're trying to pump the price up so they can dump their own shares before it collapses again also note that these days it 's remarkably easy to run the scam where you sell half your customers buy advice and the other half sell advice on the same stock each time some of the customers drop out in disgust half minus whoever decides to give you another chance and the rest pay you for the next iteration you can make a lot of money before you run out of suckers that all by itself is good reason to be skeptical about anyone who does n't publish their full history so it can be audited for such shenanigans

there needs to be more numbers with your choices without those any answer is purely speculation assuming that india is much like the us you are almost always better to go with a company leased car   that is if you are not responsible for the lease if your employment ends with the company here in the us companies typically reimburse so tax free their employees for about 50 cents per mile or about 31 cents per   this barely covers the gas and insurance and falls way short when one includes and maintenance   so it is better to have the company to pick up all those costs       borrowing money on a car is just plain dumb no matter what the interest rate   so i would stick with choice number 1 or 3 depending on the arrangement for the company leased car the next question becomes how much you should spend for a car   i would say enough to keep you happy and safe but not much more than that until you are wealthy

they do n't actually though in some time frames s&p 500 growth out performs s&p 500 it often lags this is because growth does n't refer to what happens to your account but rather the type of stock in the index roughly speaking it 's the half of the s&p with the best earnings growth   that would be great except it 's not looking for is to see if that growth is worth buying a stock with a 20 growth rate is a great buy at a p e of 15 but a terrible buy at p 50   that leads to what jb king was talking about there 's also the s&p 500 value which is roughly the cheapest stocks relative to earnings value does tend to beat the broad index over the long haul because there 's nothing like getting a good deal note a stock can be in both the growth and value categories this holds true with other indexes as well like the 2000 all that said you 're not going to see a huge difference between s&p 500 and s&p 500 growth i believe this is because the s&p 500 itself leans a bit to the side    ps with vanguard is tracking the s&p 500 growth index which is actually a thing and not vanguard itself filtering stocks

day trading is probably the most often tried and failed activity in the financial world people think they can $ 1,000 investment into $ 1,000,000 in a week with little or no knowledge on how to evaluate stocks and or companies they think they can just look at where the line graphs been and forecast where it 's going to be next week unfortunately if it were that simple everyone would be making money hand over fist in the market    so in short the reason day trading is considered a risky venture is because most of the people that attempt to do it are willfully ignorant they intentionally choose not to read about day trading they intentionally choose not to learn about how to read a company 's financial report and they intentionally choose not to learn how to compare one stock to another they also do n't consider the fact that most of their data is 15 or more min old because of the shady rules brokers have worked into the system   real everyday investors that make money in the market do it by careful evaluation of the purchase they are about to make guess what even they lose time to time that 's the game

what you are suggesting will not work banks have strict guidelines about what they can and can not do with an fha loan property remember the fha is only an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan   the bank wo n't take the risk of violating their insurance policy and the government refusing to pay them off if you default instead consider doing a creative sale on your property maybe a rent to own deal or owner financing as long as you pay the mortgage the bank wo n't even know you do n't live there and you can rent the house out to someone who eventually will buy it after the timeframe expires meanwhile you can go and get a new home or condo either thru regular financing or owner the internet to see how to do this and you can use owner financing until you complete the sale of the first house otherwise just tough it out in the house you are in until the time expires and then sell you made no mention of the property value but i am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity note that if you sell at that time though you will likely have to come out of cash because your equity wo n't cover the realtor fee and closing cost but if you do the rent to own i suggested earlier you can sell at a slightly higher price making sure you can cover those cost i realize this answer is a little out the box but i deal with people who do n't want properties all day and i have completed transactions like this many times good luck and god bless

since you used the dollar sign without any qualification i assume you 're in the united states and talking about us dollars you have a few options here i wo n't make a specific recommendation but will present some options and hopefully useful information here 's the short story to buy individual stocks you need to go through a broker these brokers charge a fee for every transaction usually in the neighborhood of $ 7 since you probably wo n't want to just buy and hold a single stock for 15 years the fees are probably unreasonable for you if you want the educational experience of picking stocks and managing a portfolio i suggest not using real money most mutual funds have minimum investments on the order of a few thousand dollars if you shop around there are mutual funds that may work for you in general look for a fund that an example of a fund that meets these requirements is from charles which tracks the s&p 500 buy the product directly from the mutual fund company if you go through a broker or financial manager they 'll try to rip you off the main advantage of such a mutual fund is that it will probably make your daughter significantly more money over the next 15 years than the safer options the tradeoff is that you have to be prepared to accept the volatility of the stock market and the possibility that your daughter might lose money your daughter can buy savings bonds through the us treasury 's treasurydirect website there are two relevant varieties you and your daughter seem to be the intended customers of these products they are available in low denominations and they guarantee a rate for up to 30 years the series i bonds are the only product i know of that 's guaranteed to keep pace with inflation until redeemed at an unknown time many years in the future it is probably not a big concern for your daughter in these amounts but the interest on these bonds is exempt from state taxes in all cases and is exempt from federal taxes if you use them for education expenses the main weakness of these bonds is probably that they 're too safe you can get better returns by taking some risk and some risk is probably acceptable in your situation savings accounts including so called money market accounts from banks are a possibility they are very convenient but you might have to shop around for one that i do n't have any particular insight into whether these are likely to outperform or be outperformed by treasury bonds remember however that the interest rates are not guaranteed over the long run and that money lost to inflation is significant over 15 years certificates of deposit are what a bank wants you to do in your situation you hand your money to the bank and they guarantee a rate for some number of months or years you pay a penalty if you want the money sooner the longest terms i 've typically seen are 5 years but there may be longer terms available if you shop around you can probably get better rates on cds than you can through a savings account the rates are not guaranteed in the long run since the terms wo n't last 15 years and you 'll have to get new cds as your old ones mature again i do n't have any particular insight on whether these are likely to keep up with inflation or how performance will compare to treasury bonds watch out for the same things that affect savings accounts in particular fees and reduced rates for balances of your size

i 'm not familiar with the law and taxes in india but can provide guidance based on general accounting and tax principles you are right that receiving money as a loan is not income and is n't liable to income tax therefore i suggest you actually this loan through a written contract with your friend the contract should include all the usual elements of a loan amount interest even if preferential or zero principal term consequences of default and currency of loan you can then simply state the purpose of transfer as personal loan agreement if you have such a document and are questioned by tax authorities you can easily show that the inward remittance is from a loan and should therefore be treated like any commercial loan for tax purposes as long as you disclose the debt in your tax return if required in india and your friend discloses any interest received as income i think you 'll be above board and wo n't be liable for any income tax to make sure you might be better off having a quick consultation with an accountant or tax specialist in india to advise you and draft the loan agreement

i would hold off on making that threat closing your account first because as others have said it 's not likely to help and second assuming you 're willing to make good on that threat you should only play that card as a final absolute last resort because if it fails and you close your account there is little to nothing else you can try to get what you want first talk one on one with a personal banker at your local ba branch you might be surprised at how helpful they can be next try talking to customer service on the phone after that you might try sending a letter to corporate hq a lot depends on the particular feature you are talking about and why they removed it it could be that 1 the bank finds the feature is just too costly provide for free 2 there may be a technical reason why they can no longer provide it 3 it could be as simple as that few to none of their customers excluding you are actually using the feature or 4 it could be that due to changing regulation or market forces no bank is offering that feature anymore also while they may not care specifically about your business the local branch has an incentive to not drive customers away if it can be reasonably avoided

gt;they especially the atlantic does investigative journalism vice on the other hand does investigative journalism on the level of buzzfeed    the atlantic is a magazine publisher they publish curated content they do not produce that content   buzzfeed was started as a viral lab to track viral content then it developed into a internet media production house that 's why they try to produce viral content but have a general reputation for creating clickbait the most legitimate part of its reporting is that it actually pays reporters to go to things like the press its revenue is about m a year   vice is a broadcast company worth over $ its revenues exceed $ 1b a year particularly due to its lucrative deal with hbo the fact that hbo charges premium prices for access to this content should be enough to distinguish it from outlets like buzzfeed which is completely free and open to access vice is a producer of content and not just a publisher broadcaster of information you 've falsely equated them in quality to buzzfeed perhaps by correlating that they are both recent upstarts   gt;i mean this linked piece is shallow to say the least    correct i 'm very skeptical of anyone reporting on a report that they themselves co wrote while touting co founding an advocacy organization as somehow being a qualifier credential i would normally consider this to be paid content although it is unclear if the writer paid for vice to publish it the quality of the image editing was also very poor of course i doubt this content would ever make it into the more premium vice communication channels specifically i doubt this content would be covered in any capacity on hbo that 's why i said at some point that the quality of its reporting is inconsistent and sometimes quite dubious   gt;why you think vice does quality work is beyond me the only possible reason is you are their main demographic    it 's not because it appeals to me as someone well versed in media politics i ensure that my media diet is diverse and broadly sourced the reason that i think some of their work is good is because i actually read it and think some of it is actually credible and worthy of my time it 's very clear that you do not find vice news credible so you want to act like your perceptions are equal in value and accuracy with my perceptions of it the problem with your logic is that i actually am exposed to its content while you self select not to expose yourself to it i like some of it because i find that some of it has a reasonable basis underlying the claim and i ca n't get the news anywhere else so you think our perceptions are equally accurate although mutually exclusive i.e. we disagree with each other or you think your perceptions are more accurate than mine most likely due to a confirmation bias but the reality is that my perceptions are broadly based considerations based on a much larger sampling of their content while your perceptions amount to an opinion derived from a first impression glance

stocks as an asset represent the sum of the current market value of all of your holdings if your portfolio is showing unrealized gains and losses then that net amount is inherently reflected in the current market value of your holdings   that 's not to say cost basis is not important any closed trades realized gains or losses will of course have an impact on your taxable income so it could n't hurt to keep track of your cost basis from a tax standpoint but understand that the term asset refers to the current market values and does not consider base amounts taxes do perhaps consider making separate cells for cost basis but also bear in mind that most if not all of the major online discount brokers will provide transferring of cost basis information electronically to the major online tax service providers

i 'd answer it this way   what do you want to do i 'd say any amount is acceptable from as low as $ 100   when you look at the specific tree of investing paying $ 5 for a $ 100 seems unacceptable   however when observing the forest what does it matter if you waste $ 5 on a commission   your friends and maybe you probably waste more than $ 5 multiple times per day   for them buying a latte might empower them if buying another share of hd for a similar cost you than do it   in the end who will be better off studies show that the more important part of building a significant investment portfolio is actually doing it   rate of return and the cost of investing pales in comparison to actually doing it   how many of your peers are doing similar things   you are probably in very rare company if it makes you happy it is a wonderful way to spend your money

looking at your numbers i would definitively consider selling the car and use the public transportation instead you could easily save $ 450 month plus gas and maintenance as you mentioned public transportation will be only a fraction of this amount so you might end up saving around $ 400 monthly if you decide to keep the car the amount that you will spent monthly is easily a payment for a brand new car what if god forbid for any kind of reason you get a traffic ticket that can increase your insurance premium what if the engine stops working and you will need to spent thousands of dollars fixing the car with this and all of the other expenses up you might be unable to afford all this at some point if you decide to sell the car the money that you will save monthly can be put in a savings account or in any other sort of safe investment instrument in this way if your situation changes where you need a car again you will be able to easily afford a new car regarding your need to visit your friends on the suburbs every other weekend i think you can just talk with them and meet on places where public transportation is available or ask them to pick you up in the nearest station to the suburbs   in conclusion based on what you said i do not think the little convenience that you get in owning the car outweighs the big savings that you get monthly if you decide to sell the car

yes there is   i was a victim of experian 's breach last year   the only thing these credit reporting agencies sell is their opinion   if their opinion is not worth shit because they are compromised then what they sell has little value   next time you hear a lender explaining to you this credit score ask them if they still remember how to underwrite without it because it is going away   they will look at you and try to carefully explain its importance but you are under no obligation to believe them   tell them sucks and so does much of the 80s music they still listen to

if you 're worried about investing all at once you can deploy your starting chunk of cash gradually by investing a bit of it each month quarter etc dollar cost averaging   the financial merits and of this have been debated but it is unlikely to lose you a lot of money and if it has the psychological benefit of inducing you to invest it can be worth it even if it results in slightly less than optimal gains more generally you are right with what you say at the end of your question in the long run when you start wo n't matter as long as you continue to invest regularly   the boglehead style index fund based theory is basically that yes you might save money by investing at certain times but in practice it 's almost impossible to know when those times are so the better choice is to just keep investing no matter what   if you do this you will eventually invest at high and low points so the ups and downs will be moderated also note that from this perspective your example of investing in 2007 is incorrect   it 's true that a person who put money in 2007 and then sat back and did nothing would have barely broken even by now   but a person who started to invest in 2007 and continued to invest throughout the economic downturn would in fact reap substantial rewards due to continued investing throughout the lows   happily i speak from experience on this point

it seems i can make contributions as employee elective employer    match or profit sharing yet they all end up in the same 401k from my    money since i 'm both the employer and employee in this situation correct what does this mean for my allowed limits for each of the 3 types of    contributions are all 3 types deductible deductible nothing is deductible first you need to calculate your compensation according to the irs it is this compensation is your earned income which is defined as net earnings    from self employment after deducting both so assuming numbers for example not real numbers your business netted $ 30 and $ 500 is the se tax half you contributed $ 17.5 max for yourself your compensation is thus 30 17.5 your business can contribute up to 25 of that on your behalf i.e. $ 4k. total that you can contribute in such a scenario is $ whatever is contributed to a regular 401k is deferred i.e. excluded from income for the current year and taxed when you withdraw it from 401k not deducted deferred

so if i understand the investment program here you have $ 100 of tax withheld from your salary at the end of jan feb mar until december   this withholding is in excess of the expected tax for the year you use the appropriate h&r block product to file your taxes and h&r block gets your refund of $ 1200 on march 1st   h&r block adds 10 and give you e cards for $ on the face of it this represents a return of per year compounded monthly however there are a few wrinkles that might make the scheme less inviting you 'll get a receipt for miscellaneous income from h&r block and pay tax on the earnings the quoted return is only realized if you can use the e cards immediately   if they sit around for a while then they are n't earning any interest   if you sell them for cash at a discount if you even can   then this reduces the return   if you do n't cash them at all they 're a total loss this offer was announced on jan 15 2015   so you ca n't go back and put it in place for 2014   and if you set it up for withholding in 2015 is there any guarantee that it the same offer will be in place when filing in 2016

first of all i have to recognize up front that my spending personality is frugal i do n't recreational shop and i save a lot of my total income building a budget and sticking to it is difficult especially for people who are closer to living paycheck to paycheck than i. theoretically it should be easy to stick to a budget by overestimating expenses but for many people planning to spend more than necessary is n't a luxury available that said i have a system that works for me maybe it can work for you this system lets me see how much i have to spend and close to optimally arranges assets as you can see this system relies on some pretty strong upfront planning and adherence to the plan and what you might not realize is that you can deviate from the plan in two ways by spending variations and by timing variations credit should really help with a lot of the timing variations it takes a series of expenses and translates them into one lump payment every month   as for spending variations like spending 20 dollars for lunch when you only budgeted 5 it turns out this technique helps a lot some academic work suggests that spending with plastic is more likely to blow your budget than cash unless you make detailed plans but it sounds like your main problem is knowing whether you can afford to splurge and the future minimum balance of your checking account can be your splurge number

it comes down to liability if a fraudulent transaction takes place with a debit card you are out $ $ until it is resolved while as with a credit card the credit lender is out $ $ the credit lender does not like losing $ $ and therefore would like to be paid extra $ $ for assuming this risk and they found the merchant as the one most willing to pay sometimes the merchant will pass on this cost to the consumer but often times the credit card company has a contract with the merchant preventing such a fee because then they would be at a price disadvantage when compared to debit

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

first of all that link is nonsense i recommend you read the actual gao audit report which has 16 t in revolving loans with only if i recall about 1.8 t in actual loans at any one time secondly every time i check the details of a claim from bernie sanders he has stretched the truth far beyond reasonable mostly to keep his name in the news i expect   now there was nothing that secret about anything in that report that was not reported in gao reports from earlier this audit was done for political purposes mostly and the fed has audits done regularly as i stated earlier this too can be checked and i you do so rather than believe me or that story   that incident as you call it is already exceeding rare you have to weigh the pros cons of that incident which as i pointed out is not really an incident with the problems that arise when you make more transparent and governmental control of the fed if the fed has a role in stabilizing the economy which is it 's mandate and if many of the tools do not work as well with more transparency and if there is evidence across many countries that doing such things to the fed will likely result in certain problems then one should make that call however to want those changes made while being ignorant of the issues is a terrible idea and it is the least informed that usually yell the loudest for such changes this would not be a problem except then certain politicians realize they can get votes by pandering to the ignorant masses which really leads to tanked economies   find how many economies have been tanked by an independent central banks versus how many have been tanked by political forces meddling with their respective economies   finally i highly recommend anytime you read a story that sounds outrageous track down the source material and read it yourself if you can not find source material or they do not   list it then distrust them   you 'll find times the is created by selectively pulling information from the actual reports then track down report sources wherever possible etc   seriously read the actual report

you can use the to make an investment   or to buy something   that 's why people keep reminding you that you could make interest   because most people think of either 7200 now or paying the same 7200 over time   so you could just be storing the 7200 under the mattress until you pay it out   obviously in that case inflation does n't matter is not applicable   you 've given up the use of the 7200 from the beginning    think of it instead as 7200 now and twenty three payments of 300 each   so total   then you can spend on something else at the beginning or spend 300 a month on other things   the difference between spending now and 300 in each of twenty three months would be measured in inflation   of course this requires you to have both 7200 now and an income stream producing at least 300 a month    another way of doing things is to take and invest it   each month you remove 300 and use it to make a payment   we 're now back to just one 7200 plus the interest over time   i would argue that this is still an inflation advantage   it 's just that instead of spending the money you invested it   and that of course is your prerogative    the point being that you would not have that opportunity if you paid up front    now to calculate the difference in monthly payments of 300 euro using the above webpage what should i do    as already said you would have to calculate twenty three values and then sum them with the 300 you pay up front in the monthly    there are other ways to calculate it if you are not using that particular tool   for example there are formulas to calculate the net present value of an annuity   e.g. see investopedia    where p = the present value of an annuity stream pmt = the dollar amount of each annuity payment r = the inflation rate n = the number of periods in which payments will be made investopedia talks about interest rates but you can put inflation there for this purpose   in that case r might better be called the discount rate    pmt is 300 r is whatever estimate you are using for inflation   e.g. per period n is 23    note that the monthly inflation rate is smaller than the annual rate   so is about annually   annually is more like a month    i found calculators for this with search terms present value of annuity calculator   some of the calculators will take the annual rate and number of periods per year as input   or the calculator may take a monthly rate as a percentage .3 rather than as a decimal   so be careful of the inputs    this gives me a net present value npv of for the 23 payments of 300 assuming .3   or is the npv of the monthly payments and 7200 is the npv of the 7200 up front    obviously if you can pay less than up front rather than 7200 then it makes more sense to pay up front    even without a discount though it still may make more sense to pay up front    how much those intangibles are worth is up to you

the hire a pro is quite correct if you are truly making this kind of money that said i believe in a certain amount of self education so you do n't follow a pro 's advice blindly first i wrote an article that discussed marginal tax rates and it 's worth understanding it simply means that as your income rises past certain thresholds the tax rate also will change a bit you are on track to be in the top rate 33   next solo 401(k you did n't ask about retirement accounts but the combined situations of making this sum of money and just setting it aside leads me to suggest this since you are both employer and employee the solo 401(k limit is a combined $ seems like a lot but if you are really on track to make $ 500 k this year that 's just over 10 saved    then whatever the pro recommends for your status you 'll still have some kind of social security obligation as both employer and employee so that 's another 15 or so for the first $   last some of the answers seemed to imply that you 'll settle in april not quite you are required to pay your tax through the year and if you wait until april to pay the tax along with your return you will have a very unpleasant tax bill i mean it will have penalties for underpayment through the year this is to be avoided   i offer this because often a pro will have a specialty and not go outside that focus it 's possible to find the guy that knows everything about setting you up as an llc or sole proprietorship yet does n't have the 401(k conversation   good luck please let us know here how the pro discussion goes for you

people just love becoming more well off than they currently are and one of the ways they do it is with leverage leverage requires credit that desire is not exclusive to people who are not already well off for a well off person who wants to become more well off by expanding their real estate ventures paying cash for property is a terrible way to go about it the same goes for other types of business or market investment credit benefits the well off even more greatly than it benefits the poor or the middle class

i feel like the idea vote with your dollars has been around for a long time now but very few people have enacted it seriously   just think how much shit businesses get away with because they have little to no actual worry of anybody taking their business elsewhere   a serious large amount of people would have to actually do so to make an impact but they do n't   meanwhile we know what happens when people actually do stop buying from businesses e.g the disappearance of brick and mortar music stores since the advent of digital   so what 's the difference   obviously it is convenience   when it was convenient for people to get their music digitally they stopped buying cds   but it is apparently too inconvenient to adjust you buying for political reasons   which is of course shortsighted when you take the long term consequences into account as inconveniences and in many cases these consequences are far worse than a mere inconvenience

unfortunately 100 of these issues are directly related to private industry ’s willingness to use any tool to get the upper hand   it is unwise to hand the keys to thieves just because the cops are corrupt   it is equally unwise to hand power to private corporations just because the government is corrupt   however as i have often noted before when you find you are stuck between two options it means you are failing to observe all the variation and you can manipulate in between and around those options   you are failing to see the middle ground and your surroundings as opportunities   there must be a measure that will satisfy both our views   we must simply observe more nuances in our subject matter   a quote i have heard from engineers   the hardest problem is framing the issue in such a way that it can be solved   a.k.a our choice of perspective most often defines our limitations and a change of perspective changes those limitations

how do i account for this in the bookkeeping here is an example below   this is how you would accurately contributions made by an owner for a business if you would want to remove money from your company or pay yourself back this would be called withdrawals it would be the inverse of the first journal entry with cash on the credit side and withdrawals on the debited side as it is an expense   you and your business are not the same thing you are two different entities this is why you are taxed as two different entities when you the owner make contributions it is considered to be the cash of the business from here you will make these expenses against the business and not yourself   good luck

i understand that if i have multiple health insurance policies i can only make claim from only one of them if ever i incur medical expenses i 'm from the philippines in the us you can not simultaneously submit a claim for payment of a medical bill or request reimbursement for a bill already paid to multiple insurance companies but if you are covered by more   than one policy then any part of a claim not paid by one company   can be submitted to another company that is also covering you in fact if you have employer paid or employer provided coverage most   insurance companies will want your employer provided insurance company   to be billed first and will cover whatever is not paid by the employer coverage for example if the employer coverage pays 80 of your doctor 's bill the private insurance will pay the remaining 20 but the private   insurance policies are also quite expensive   some professional groups in the us offer major medical coverage to   their us members and might be offering this to non us members as well though i suspect not   these policies have large deductibles so that coverage kicks in only when the total medical expenses in that year whether wholly or partially reimbursed or not reimbursed at all exceed the large deductible   these types of policies actually pay out to only a few people if you have more than say $ 20,000 of medical expenses in a year you have been quite ill   and thus the premiums are usually much smaller than full fledged coverage   insurance policies which pay out much more frequently because of much smaller deductibles

but i do n't see how it 's any different than buying a stock at a low price and holding on to it for some months based on your question i would say the difference is time day trading by its nature is a endeavor if you buy low and are planning to sell high then you only have a few hours to make this happen as a previous poster mentioned there is a lot of white noise that occurs on a weekly daily hourly min basis long term investors have the time to wait it out although as a side note if you were a buy and hold investor from the 1960s early 1980s then buy and hold was not very good is it just the psychological addictive aspect of it this is the biggest reason day trading is stressful and stress can cause financially destructive decisions such as over leveraging over trading etc why is day trading stressful because you are managing hundreds to thousands of trades a year when combined with the lack of time in a day to make moves it becomes stressful also many day traders do it full time which adds to the pressure to be correct and to be incredible at money a lot of buy and hold investors have full time jobs and may only check their positions every month or so

typically mutual funds will report an annualized return it 's probably an average of 8 per year from the date of inception of the fund that at least gives some basis of comparison if you 're looking at funds of different ages they will also often report annualized 1- 3- 5- and year returns which are probably better basis of comparison since they will have experience the same market booms and busts   so yes generally that 8 gets compounded yearly on average at that rate you 'd get your investment doubled in roughly 9 years on average of course past performance ca n't guarantee future results and all that and variation is often significant with returns that high might be 15 one year -2 the next etc hence my emphasis on specifying on average edit based on the fund given in the comments so in your fund the times less than a year 1 mo 3 mo 6 mo 1 yr is the actual relative change that of fund in that time period anything greater is averaged using cagr approach for example the most recent 3 year period probably ending end of last month had a averaged return 2014 2015 and 2016 had individual returns of and thus that total return over that three year period was = 21 return over three years this is the same total growth that would be achieved if each year saw consistent 6.5 growth ^ 3 =   not exactly the but remember we 're looking at a slightly different time window but it 's pretty close and hopefully helps clarify how the calculation is done

you may withdraw penalty free from a 401(k if you separate from service at 55 or later this may make the rolling to any ira not a good idea you can withdraw penalty free if you are disabled you can withdraw penalty free if you take the withdrawal using a process called section 72 t which basically means a steady withdrawal for either 5 years or until age 59 1/2 whichever is second   aside from these exceptions the concept is to be allowed to take withdrawals after 59 1/2 but you must start to take withdrawals starting at 70 1/2 these are called rmds required minimum distributions and represent a small fraction of the account at 70 at 80 at 90   each year you take a minimum of this fraction of the account value and pay the tax if you had a million dollars your first withdrawal would be $ you 'd be in the 15 marginal rate with this income   in general it 's always a good idea to be aware of your marginal tax rate for example a married filing joint couple would be in the 15 bracket up to a taxable $ in 2015 at withdrawal time and as the year moves along if they are on track to have a taxable $ for example it would be wise to take the extra $ 10,000 either as a withdrawal to put aside for the next year or as a roth conversion this way as the rmds increase they have a reduced chance to push the couple to the next tax bracket

typically as an individual you ca n't just decide you want to lend out some securities there is a lot of legalities that must take place in order to engage in such a transaction it 's a regulated industry and the contractual obligations that exist between borrower and seller are taken care of ahead of time by the broker with their client prior to any actual transaction taking place i say typically becuase i 'm guessing that if you are a large enough client and own a substantial block of shares i really mean a lot you may be in the unique position of being able to lend out i 'm not sure what the logistics of this would look like but i think the brokerage house would approach you and negotiate a borrowing rate in that situation you may negotiate lending to the the brokerage house and not necessarily directly to the borrower

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

tax cuts do lead to economic growth and why not   more money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody   it ’s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts   the problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans   the growth will occur but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model   so a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth   then hopefully that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state

from myfico a foreclosure remains on your credit report for 7 years but its impact to your fico ® score will lessen over time while a foreclosure is considered a very negative event by your fico score it 's a common misconception that it will ruin your score for a very long time in fact if you keep all of your other credit obligations in good standing your fico score can begin to rebound in as little as 2 years the important thing to keep in mind is that a foreclosure is a single negative item and if you keep this item isolated it will be much less damaging to your fico score than if you had a foreclosure in addition to defaulting on other credit obligations personal note i tip my hat to you sir regardless of party we owe our a debt of gratitude if i had my way a va loan would ignore the past short sale i wish you well and thank you for serving

firstly tax credits are not confiscated taxpayer dollars they are taxpayer dollars which are not confiscated   secondly all forms of transportation and energy production receive billions in confiscated taxpayer dollars   sometimes when the future is clear electric vehicles it 's worthwhile to provide temporary subsidies to an industry   tax credits are an excellent way to change taxpayer behaviour   if the government prefers electric vehicles as one way of reducing air pollution tax credits seem a remarkably cost effective way of doing so in comparison to some of the other options people discuss higher taxes on gasoline for example or more restrictive regulation on car manufacturers

they believe that it reduces the risk that revenue canada will deem you to be an employee and make them pay a whole pile of tax ei cpp and so on that should have been paid if you had been hired as an employee it 's my recollection that the employer gets dinged for both the employee and employer share of those withholdings and generally the employer 's share is larger than yours so they really want to prevent it there 's a revenue canada publication about whether you 're an employee or not there 's nothing on it about being incorporated but still employers feel more protected when their contracts are incorporated   we did work as a sole proprietorship at the very beginning so that we could deduct our losses against employment income earned earlier in the year before we started the business you can find clients who will take you on we incorporated once the losses were over with basically we had bought the equipment and office supplies we needed to get started it 's a simple and relatively inexpensive thing to do and gives clients a sense of protection it wo n't protect you from your own poor decisions since you 'll be a director of the firm

there are several types of financial advisors some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like their services are often free on the other hand the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own company 's products and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains remember anything free is being paid for by someone and if you do n't know who it 's generally going to be you there are some who are good but i could n't give you any advice on finding them others are not associated with any of the above and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risk tolerance without any affiliation to any particular company   consulting these folks does cost you or if it 's offered as a benefit your employer some money but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else they are n't likely to suggest you try anything very sexy but when it comes to your primary long term savings exciting is usually not a good thing the folks i spoke to were of the latter type they looked at my savings and my plans talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals picked a fairly standard strategy from their files ran simulations against it to sanity check it and gave me a suggested mix of low overhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds has acceptable levels of risk and i admit i 've been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns nothing exciting but even though i 'm relatively risk tolerant i 'd say excitement is the last thing i need in my long term savings i should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanity check a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whether when i might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans whether roth versus traditional 401(k makes any difference at all at this point in my career and so on

unfortunately that 's a call only you can make and whichever route you choose comes with advantages and disadvantages   if you manage your money directly you may significantly reduce costs assuming that you do n't frequently trade index funds or you use a brokerage like robinhood and take advantage of market returns if the indexes perform well   on the other hand if the market experiences some bad years a professional might and this is a huge might have more self discipline and prevent a panic sell or know how to allocate accordingly both before and after a rise or fall keep in mind investors often get too greedy for their own good like they tend to panic at the wrong time   as an example of why this might is important one family member of mine trusted a professional to do this and they failed they bought in a rising market and sold in a falling market to avoid the above example if you do go with the professional service the best course of action is to look at their track record if they 're new you might be better on your own   since i assume this one or more professionals at the company testing to see what they 've recommended over the years might help you evaluate if they 're offering you a good choice finally depending on how much money you have you could always do what scott did he took a portion of his own money and managed it himself and tested how well he did vs. how well his professional team did if i recall i believe he came out ahead of his professional team   with two decades left that may help guide you the rest of the way even through retirement

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

someone asked this over in /r they were asking how to profit off nv specifically but here 's what i wrote there i 'd be curious what you guys think   gt go back in time about 6 mo case the medical scene for movers and write some proposals to help them expand traditional banks wo n't touch financing these guys with a 10 ft stick right now the fed has told them straight up they will lose fdic membership if they touch drug money cough cough tobacco and alcohol do n't count cough cough if you do n't have a time machine either come up with a way to be a bank to these guys without going to a fed lockup or go finance expansion in the next state which it 's gon na be a while until these guys get integrated with the regular money system to the point they have stocks and such or maybe the fed freezing them out as they make a fortune will just push forward crypto currency and the collapse of the current money oligarchy who knows   there was also some comments about shipping from nv to home states which is probably a bad idea for many reasons i did however feel i can offer some insight on a legal president for this kind of behavior   but exactly how legal to avoid direct shipping of a purchase to a state is i mean once it 's your proper legal property and you 're just shipping it to yourself that does seem legal right or if it would get the same blind eye when done with pot are huge unknowns   gt;i'm sure the feds will not see a problem with sending drugs to yourself across state lines actually funny enough i live in the wine region of ca and there is a whole business here of wine storage and shipping places it 's up to the states to decide how or if they allow alcohol to be shipped into their state from others and a bunch of state have very complex rules or just do n't allow it so if you come out here for tourism drink some wine at a like it and ask if you can have some shipped home the answer is about 50/50 to be no and if you 're a average income that 's your answer if you 're some rich dude however you can say ah gotcha pesky laws well here 's the address of my storage and shipping place send the 2 cases there then nobody bats an eye and off the cases go guy goes home calls up the shipping place and says hey pull those cases my personal property and ship them to me and somehow magically this is now legal i have no idea who 's taking on the liability here if the shipping place has them sign off we will ship wherever you ask it 's not our job to verify the legality of your request then i guess it 's on the consumer but if you have an entire business built around circumventing state law it would seem to me that this should be a legal problem but wine is a high end commodity rich people make their own rules and if ca turns a blind eye to this practice they get to collect the sales tax as it 's sold in ca and shipped to a location in ca whereas fighting it would hurt their tourism and also send the tax income to the states being shipped to baby   re reading this now i 'm not even sure if there is a liability here they bought the property in ca paid tax in ca and had it sent to a mailing address in ca what they do after that with their personal property is not the states business right i 'd imagine this would be drastically different if shipping for resale similarly i think this all only works if you complete the transaction while physically in the state so at most this might turn on some weed tourism   the big difference in all of this is that the fed is fine with alcohol but not weed so while i suspect someone will form such a weed storage and shipping place at some point i do n't really want to be first in line to see how this and if it lands you in trouble with the fed

a combination of market research and tax law would likely be the combination used to set the salary an of each taxes in canada and the us there can be differences in how payments are treated if they are salary e.g payroll taxes such as cpp social security and others may apply in this case as well as personal income tax rates or dividends which may have different treatments in some jurisdictions i believe if salary above $ 250,000 is taxed at 40 and dividends are taxed at 15 which rate would you rather pay this is hypothetical as no jurisdiction has been noted here yet most provinces and states in north america will tax the first few dollars at rather low rates and so it is n't bad to take a nominal rate of $ 1 or so in salary as usually the higher rates exist for higher salaries executive compensation has come under scrutiny in recent years though it is usually a mix of salary bonuses and stock either restricted or options market research some companies may research what other small public companies would pay executives as the salary may have to be approved by a board of directors in some cases at least this would be how i remember things being decided in small companies i worked for in washington state and the province of alberta in a lot of company cases excess earnings are stored and if there is enough of a pile then a special dividend may be given out though some corporate structures like reits force dividends to maintain their tax status note the payment in dividend here requires that the president be able to dictate what happens with the cash in the bank of a company which is n't going to be the case for the regular employee also the dividends here would go to all the shareholders and thus if there are people besides the president owning shares they would also get their portion based on what they own

your question is based on incorrect assumptions generally there 's no penalty per se to make a withdrawal from your rrsp even if you make a withdrawal earlier than retirement however you define it a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant our u.s. neighbours have a 10 penalty on non hardship early withdrawals before age 59 half from retirement accounts like the 401k and ira it 's an additional measure designed to discourage early withdrawals and raise more tax   yet in canada there is no similar penalty individual investments inside your rrsp may have associated penalties such as the dreaded deferred sales charge of some back end loaded mutual funds or such as funds that generated additional special tax credits that could get clawed back   yet these early withdrawal penalties are distinct from the rrsp nature of your account   choose your investments carefully to avoid these kinds of surprises rather an rrsp is a tax deferred account and it works like this   the government allows you to claim a nice juicy tax deduction which can reduce your income tax at your marginal rate in the year you make a contribution or later if you should choose to defer the deduction the resulting pre tax money accumulated in your rrsp benefits from further tax deferral assets can grow without attracting annual income tax on earned interest dividends or capital gains you do n't need to declare on your income tax return any of the income earned inside your rrsp unlike a regular investment account here 's the rub once you decide to withdraw money from your rrsp the entire amount withdrawn is considered regular income in the year in which you make the withdrawal   thus your withdrawals are subject to income tax and yes at your marginal rate   this is always the case whether before or after retirement you mentioned two special programs the home buyers plan hbp and the lifelong learning plan llp   neither the hbp nor the llp permit tax free withdrawals   rather each of these programs are special kinds of loans that you can borrow from your own rrsp hbp and llp loan money is n't taxed when you get it because you are required to pay it back and you pay it back into your own rrsp you always pay income tax at your marginal rate on your rrsp withdrawals above i said a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant   yet there are ages that matter   by the end of the year in which you turn 71 you are required to convert your rrsp to a it 's similar but you can no longer contribute and you must withdraw a minimum amount each year other circumstances related to age may qualify for minor tax relief intended for retirees such as the age amount or the pension income credit   generally such measures do n't significantly change the fact that you pay income tax on rrsp withdrawals at your marginal rate these measures raise the minimum you can take out without attracting tax but most do nothing at the margin exception one might split eligible pension income with a spouse or common law partner which may reduce tax at the margin

no it can really not look at detroit which has lost a million residents over the past few decades there is plenty of real estate which will not go for anything like it was sold other markets are very risky like florida where speculators drive too much of the price for it to be stable you have to be sure to buy on the downturn a lot of price drops in real estate are masked because sellers just do n't sell so you do n't really know how low the price is if you absolutely had to sell in general in most of america anyway you can expect real estate to keep up with inflation but not do much better than that it is the rental income or the leverage if you buy with a mortgage that makes most of the returns in urban markets that are getting an influx of people and industry however real estate can indeed outpace inflation but the number of markets that do this are rare also if you look at it strictly as an investment as opposed to the question of is it worth it to own my own home there are a lot of additional costs that you have to recoup from property taxes to bills rental headaches etc it 's an investment like any other and should be approached with the same due diligence

find a mechanic in the area that will for a fee do a pre approval inspection   then when you call the seller to inquire you can ask them to let you take the vehicle there as part of your test drive i 'm not sure how many rv mechanics there are that do n't work for a dealership and those that do may be less inclined to assist you in purchasing from a private party   you could also have a friend or family member who is a mechanic or good with vehicles come along   also the seller may not want to bother with the extra hassle and if it really is a good deal they likely wo n't need to    of course the other option is to just test drive it and trust your gut   this does n't sound like a huge risk at   even if it breaks down right away and ca n't be repaired for a reasonable price you could scrap the vehicle and hopefully make up a significant portion of the purchase price

gt bernie sources    i would agree it looks like the tax would cover all those that buy stock bonds and derivatives however this article did n't really cover the specifics what would the tax be would it a flat dollar amount per transaction that would make sense as it would focus more on those that do high volume traders that would n't really impact me as i already pay $ 9 per transaction and i do n't do many transactions a couple dollars more and i would be fine    gt to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government   ah but corporations edit would n't have the power to do much of anything without someone to enforce their policies name one market that does n't have an enforcement agency of some type that is a mighty big assumption that the free market would make it work especially since one does n't really exist    and that would be the crux of my argument all of the things you say about the perfection of the market to regulate itself is so far not proven    take a market like kansas over the last 6 years they just one of the largest deregulation de taxation experiments of any state in the union the results were less than stellar kansas is lagging the national average in growth and they took a hundred million dollar surplus and turned into a couple billion dollar deficit almost overnight and who suffers of course the most poor they shut down schools fired teachers and many infrastructure jobs jobs that would have been by lower wage workers and those infrastructure projects were undoubtedly in lower income areas    i would say if you truly believe in what you preach then live it start a somewhere demonstrate how it is effective that would have more power than preaching some amorphous policy over the internet
