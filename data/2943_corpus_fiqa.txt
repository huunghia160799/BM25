this is a classic correlation does not imply causation situation   there are at least three issues at play in this question if you are or day trading then the first and second issues can definitely affect your trading   a higher price higher volume stock will have smaller percentage volatility fluctuations within a very small period of time however in general and especially when holding any position for any period of time during which unknowns can become known such as netflix 's customer loss announcement it is a mistake to feel safe based on price alone when considering longer term investments even weeks or months and if you were to compare penny stocks with blue chip stocks you still might find more stability in the higher value stocks   this is a correlation alone in other words a stable reliable stock probably has a relatively high price but a high price does not mean it 's reliable as joe said the stock of any company that is exposed to significant risks can drop or rise by large amounts suddenly and it is common for blue chip stocks to move significantly in a period of months as changes in the market or the company itself manifest themselves the last thing to remember when you are looking at raw dollar amounts is to remember to look at shares outstanding   netflix has a price of $ 79 to ford 's $ 12 yet ford has a larger market cap because there are nearly 4 billion shares compared to netflix 's 52 m

in general when companies are regarded as hot growth stocks they are expected to keep up an accelerated level of growth for a good long time that accelerated growth justifies a high pe relative to a slow growth stock when companies that are supposed to grow miss expectations or worse lose money the markets punish the stock severely particularly if the company does n't make analysts aware of problems early on netflix is a great example of a company a few different business problems creating a much bigger one in the process a poorly conceived rate hike killed the reliable cash flow of the company and that crazy thing just confused everyone now nobody trusts the management blackberry is another example of a high performing company that just screwed up damaging shareholders in the process we 're living in a very challenging era today but growth stocks are always risky by nature growing a company rapidly is very difficult

certainly no one knows in advance how much a stock is going to swing around however there are measures of how much it has around in the past and there are people who will estimate the probability first of all there 's a measure of an individual stock 's volatility commonly referred to as beta a stock with a beta of 1 tends to rise and fall about as much as the market at large a stock with a beta of 2 in the meantime would rise 10 when the market is up 5 these are of course historical averages see wikipedia secondly you can get an implied measure of volatility expectations by looking at options pricing if a stock is particularly volatile the chance of a big price move will be baked into the price of the stock options note also that other things affect options pricing such as the time value of money for an options based measure of the volatility of the whole market see the volatility index aka the fear gauge vix   wikipedia chart looking at individual stocks as a group and there 's an oxymoron for you individual stocks are definitely much more likely to have big moves than the market besides netflix consider the bp oil spill or the tokyo electric power company 's incident i do n't have any detailed statistics on quantitatively how much mind you but in application a standard piece of advice says not to put more than 5 of your portfolio in a single company 's stock diversification protects you alternatively if you 're trying to play mr. sophisticated stock picker instead of just buying an index fund you can also buy insurance through stock options hedging your bets naturally this will eat up part of your returns if your pick was a good one

paying off your student loan before buying a house is certainly a great risk reduction move for you it will lower your debt to income ratio allowing your mortgage approval to go easier and it will free up more of your dollars to pay for the many miscellaneous projects that come with buying a house i think that if you are considering paying off your student loan before buying a house that means that your student loans are an amount you can fathom paying off and that you are motivated to be rid of your student loan debt    go for it and pay off your student loan

myself i am in a similar position i 've had a few good conversations about this with people in the financial services industry   it all depends how much time you want to spend on yielding your profits and how much risk you would like to take high time and high risk obviously means higher expected gain but also has a high chance of creating a loss option 1 you could buy a home now and take out a mortgage with a high down payment thus lower interest rates and rent it out by the time you are ready to have your own house you can decide to either take out a mortgage on your second house and make money off your first house and keep renting it out or you could move in there yourself   if you use an asset back mortgage i 'm not sure if that is the term but a mortgage where in the worst case you give your home back to the bank you generally carry least risk if you keep doing this you can have 2 houses paid off if everything goes well option 2   you could also invest in stocks this all depends on the risk you want to take and the time you want to put in it   option 3   you could also put the money in a savings account some banks will give you better interest rates if you lock the money for a set amount of years   option 4   you could buy a foreclosure and try to flip it though this is very risky and requires a lot of time also it is important to also have some sort of emergency fund so whatever you do do n't spend all your money   save some for a rainy day hope it helps

based on these dates in your question going back over my records i was able to recall the following maryland realized recently that on the 2009 federal 1040 form you stated that on december 31 2009 you in maryland they are wondering where the state tax form is dc md and va due to reciprocity collect income tax based on where you live not where you work so when you moved in august 2009 and again in august 2010 you needed to file new state versions of the w4   the fact you did or did n't submit to your employer a correct state w-4 is not directly related because you would owe the tax regardless the w-4 just makes sure that something close to the correct amounts are withheld and sent to the appropriate state capital i seem to remember something about not having to pay maryland state    taxes since i not only lived in the state for less than 6 months but    also did not work in the state the reciprocity between dc md and va says that maryland gets the money because that is where you lived the last time i had to do a part year the law was that they would forgive a half a month in other words if you move in late december or early january you could ignore that small time period and avoid having to file in two states in some cases people argue that some short term moves were never meant to be permanent you might be able to claim that except the fact that your 2009 federal tax form you most likely claimed you lived in maryland   the next issue is time and money if maryland says you   owe them money for that time period and if they still have the ability to force you to pay it this is where the issue of correct state w-4 comes in   if the money during the period you lived in maryland was sent to virginia you should have had that money refunded by richmond in the spring of 2010 but if there was no w-4 filed with your employer that would mean that maryland did n't get any money for 2009 if you did n't tell richmond you moved in 2009 they may not have refunded everything because they thought you lived there all year because of the time that has passed it may be too late to fix your virginia filing so they may not refund you excess payment to them maryland is interested in calculating how much you should have paid them in 2009 they are only looking at what you told the feds you made and they may be assuming that you lived there the whole year but until you file correctly that have no ability to calculate what you really owe you need professional advice you need to know what they can and ca n't collect you also need to know what you can and ca n't get back from richmond and since it also may impact your filings for 2010 you will want to get that resolved at the same time

there are several issues with paying for furniture and appliances with 0 credit instead of paying with cash when you pay with 0 credit you might be tempted to spend more on something than you would have if you paid with cash because it feels like free money and you 've justified in your mind that the extra you earn will help pay for the more expensive item businesses do n't offer 0 credit for free and they do n't lose money on the deal   when you shop at a store that offers 0 credit you are generally overpaying for the item   by shopping at a store that does not offer 0 credit you might be able to get a better price your savings account is likely earning very little interest   you might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed and you might not do as well as you think 0 loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments   you can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments but things can still go wrong   your bank might change your account number making the automated payment fail   as you mentioned you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account   a single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve ultimately the decision is yours of course but in my opinion there is very very little to gain with buying something on 0 credit when you could be paying cash

first a clarification no assets are immune to inflation apart from inflation indexed securities like tips or inflation indexed gilts well if held to maturity these are at least close inflation causes a decline in the future purchasing power of a given amount and it certainly does n't just affect government bonds either regardless of whether you hold equity bonds derivatives etc the real value of those assets is declining because of inflation all else being equal for example if i invest $ 100 in an asset that pays a 10 rate of return over the next year and i sell my entire position at the end of the year i have $ 110 in nominal terms inflation affects the real value of this asset regardless of its asset class because those $ 110 are n't worth as much in a year as they are today assuming inflation is positive an easy way to incorporate inflation into your calculations of rate of return is to simply subtract the rate of inflation from your rate of return using the previous example with inflation of 3 you could estimate that although the nominal value of your investment at the end of one year is $ 110 the real value is $ + 10 3 = $ 107 in other words you only gained $ 7 of purchasing power even though you gained $ 10 in nominal terms this back of the envelope calculation works for securities that do n't pay fixed returns as well consider an example retirement portfolio say i make a one time investment of $ 50,000 today in a portfolio that pays on average 8 annually i plan to retire in 30 years without making any further contributions yes this is an over simplified example i calculate that my portfolio will have a value of 50000 1 + or $ that looks like a nice amount but how much is it really worth i do n't care how many dollars i have i care about what i can buy with those dollars   if i use the same rough estimate of the effect of inflation and use a 8 3 = 5 rate of return instead i get an estimate of what i 'll have at retirement in today 's dollars that allows me to make an easy comparison to my current standard of living and see if my portfolio is up to scratch repeating the calculation with 5 instead of 8 yields 50000 1 + or $ as you can see the amount is significantly different if i 'm accustomed to living off $ 50,000 a year now my calculation that does n't take inflation into account tells me that i 'll have over 10 years of living expenses at retirement the new calculation tells me i 'll only have a little over 4 years now that i 've clarified the basics of inflation i 'll respond to the rest of the answer   i want to know if i need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country 's currency failing as others have pointed out currency does n't inflate prices denominated in that currency inflate also a currency failing is significantly different from a prices denominated in a currency inflating if you 're worried about prices inflating and decreasing the purchasing power of your dollars which usually occurs in modern economies then it 's a good idea to look for investments and asset allocations that over time have outpaced the rate of inflation and that even with the effects of inflation still give you a high enough rate of return to meet your investment goals in real inflation adjusted terms if you have legitimate reason to worry about your currency failing perhaps because your country does n't maintain stable monetary or fiscal policies there are a few things you can do first define what you mean by failing do you mean to exist or simply falling in unit purchasing power because of inflation if it 's the latter see the previous paragraph if the former investing in other currencies abroad may be a good idea questions about currencies actually failing are quite general however and in my opinion require significant economic analysis before deciding on a course of action hedging i would ask the same question about my home 's value against an inflated currency as well would it keep the same real value your home may or may not keep the same real value over time in some time periods average home prices have risen at rates significantly higher than the rate of inflation in which case on paper their real value has increased however if you need to make substantial investments in your home to keep its price rising at the same rate as inflation you may actually be losing money because your total investment is higher than what you paid for the house initially of course if you own your home and do n't have plans to move you may not be concerned if its value is n't keeping up with inflation at all times you 're deriving additional satisfaction utility from it mainly because it 's a place for you to live and you spend money maintaining it in order to maintain your physical standard of living not just its price at some future sale date 1 i use dollars as an example this applies to all currencies

out of your seven recommendations one is up 14 one up 6 four are either even or down slightly and one is down a whopping 40 this reminds me of a recommendation earlier in the year provided by the motley fool to buy when it was around the $ 40 mark i had a quick look at it and thought gee there is no way i am buying those shares now they are just below $ 15 see the chart below   you have just learnt a valuable lesson by testing these recommendations without your real money never trust investment recommendations from analysts or anyone else get yourself educated so you understand what analysts are talking about and you can make a decision for yourself better still learn about technical analysis so you can decide for yourself whether it is the right time to buy or sell

i recently sold some property in which i structured the agreement with my realtor such that i would pay the normal 6 commission 3 to each agent if the buyer came from another agent if my selling agent found his own buyer he would get 4.5 commission as a seller it 's possible to negotiate such deals before the house goes on the market if you are selling another property you could similarly structure such a deal where your selling agent picks up the commission from buying the new place and agrees to reduce the commission on the place that you are selling leaving you in a better position than if you bought unrepresented as an unrepresented buyer you only have negotiating power insofar as the market allows the seller 's agent gains nothing from what you propose so unless they expect trouble moving the house waiting to see what other offers arise is certainly an option if they are having trouble moving the house then just reduce your offer and see what happens   when i pick a selling price the main factor is that i want to attract enough buyers that i can sell it quickly interest payments do add up selling a house involves more than just listing it for sale i have a good relationship with my agent and have done multiple deals with him i am willing to pay him because i believe it benefits me to do so i would n't risk that relationship just to close a deal with an unrepresented buyer that unrepresented buyer would allow for a reduced commission to 4.5 though in the contract i mentioned above

it depends on the area but right in toronto there 's not a whole lot of development but like starter townhouses 3 modern executive look around ft start around 750k older and run houses depending on area can go from 600 1.4 million but it 's heavily dependent on area in a good area you 'll see completely run down going for 1.4 million i 'm not sure exactly who 's buying these houses but banks are n't giving as many loans now so i assume people are going private for mortgages there are incentives for first time home buyers where you do n't need much of a down payment it was around 10 but i think it 's gone up however something called mortgage insurance is required in the case of a default rent is sky high as well and rentals are just as expensive as mortgages however without the commitment cheap rentals never come up and there is sort of an internal issue with realtors who essentially hike up the prices however things have cooled off as of late   i always remember my parents saying that we good do down to the states and buy a house for less than 100k especially after 08 houses just seem to have more value in canada even in less sought after areas more north

the bank number is part of the iban number so the swift code is actually redundant it is still required for international payments because every country has its own payment infrastructure the swift code helps to route it to the correct region without having to know every single bank in that region it is usually not needed for national payments but banks ask for it anyway so that both national and international payments follow the same process   when you enter a wrong swift then this is what will happen when the swift code does exist then in the internet age it should be possible for all of this to happen within seconds but it will still take a few days because reasons iban numbers are globally unique so when you entered the correct iban there is no chance that the money will arrive on a different account than you intended to also the first two digits after the country code are a checksum so when you accidently make a typo while entering an iban there is a 99 chance that this will be detected automatically

say your bank gives you a loan at a fix interest rate   they can loan money themselves for a floating interest rate   so they try to find someone who will pay or take the difference between the fix and the floating interest rate on your loan     that 's an interest rate swap and there is nothing evil about it per se   derivatives are like knives you can use them for live saving heart surgery or just a kid in a back alley     the inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easier to create than to understand complex derivatives   this can lead to both sides believing they made on the derivative transaction a logically impossible situation   therefore it is always good when derivatives are traded in a transparent well regulated market where current market price is determined   but then the expected profit margins are small so investment bankers will always try to find more exotic derivatives think of a kid using for brain surgery     we need standard derivatives or we have to re think the whole finance world from grounds up without any guarantee we 'll find anything working any better   we do n't need exotic derivatives they 're almost exclusively there because people shoot for bonuses

another option not yet discussed here is to allow the loan to go into default and let the loaning agency repossess the property the loan was used for after which they sell it and that sale should discharge some significant portion of the loan knowing where the friend and property is you may be able to help them carry out the repossession by providing them information meanwhile your credit will take a significant hit but unless your name is on the deed title of the property then you have little claim that the property is yours just because you 're paying the loan the contract you signed for the loan is not going to be easily with a lawsuit of any sort so unless you can produce another contract between you and your friend it 's unlikely that you can even sue them in short you have no claim to the property but the loaning agency does perhaps that 's the only way to avoid paying most of the debt but you do trade some of your credit for it hopefully you understand that what you loaned was n't money but your credit score and earning potential and that you will be more careful who you choose to lend this to in the future

your plan will probably work i speak from past experience approx 5 10 years ago when lloyds used to offer tiered interest of up to 4 on £ 5000 in their vantage accounts it was allowed for an individual person to have up to three vantage accounts the criteria for obtaining the headline interest rates were simply what i and many others did was to set up three vantage accounts call them a b and c and a standing order on each to transfer minimum amount + £ 1 on the same day each month in this manner this satisfied the letter of conditions though perhaps not the spirit most importantly it satisfied the bank and all three accounts received that headline interest rate these days banks have got a little wiser to this and have started including the set up n direct debits condition which makes this a more time consuming system to arrange you must assign your various bills across your accounts but i believe that the overall plan still works they do n't care where the money comes from or whether it stays just that it comes in enough people get it wrong that they do n't have to worry about the few who get it perfectly right see also how 0 balance transfer offers can be profitable

the major drawback to borrowing to invest i.e. using leverage is that your return on investment must be high enough to overcome the cost of finance the average return on the s&p 500 is about 9.8 from cnbc a typical unsecured personal loan will have an interest rate of around 18 36 apr from nerdwallet this means that on average you will be paying more interest than you are receiving in returns so are losing money on the margin investment sometimes the s&p falls and over those periods you would be paying out interest having lost money so will have a negative return you may have better credit and so be able to get a lower rate but i do n't know your loan terms currently secured loans such as remortgaging your house will have lower costs but come with more life changing risks the above assumes that you are getting financing by directly borrowing money however it is also possible to trade on margin this is where you post a proportion of the value that you wish to trade with as collateral against a loan to buy the security this form of finance is normally used by day traders and other short term holders of stocks although the financing costs here are low i am not charged an interest rate on intraday margin trading there are very high costs if you exceed the term of the loan an example is that i am charged a fee if i hold a position overnight and my profits and losses are at that time if i am in a losing position at that time the process and fee can result in not having enough margin to recover the position and the loss of a potentially profit making position additionally if the amount of collateral cash margin posted is insufficient to cover the expected losses as calculated by your broker they will initiate a margin call asking for more collateral money if you do not or can not post this extra margin your losing position will be cashed out and you will take as a loss the total loss at that time since the market can change very rapidly such as in a flash crash this can result in your losing more money than you had in the first place as this is essentially a loan you can be bankrupted by this overall using leverage to invest magnifies your potential profits but it also magnifies your potential losses in many cases this could be sufficient to lose you more money than you had originally invested in addition to you need to consider the cost of finance and that your return over the course of the loan needs to be higher than your cost of finance as well as inflation and other opportunity costs of capital the s&p 500 is a relatively low volatility market in general so is unlikely to return losses in any given period that will mean that leverage of 1.25 times will take you into losses beyond your own capital investment but it is not impossible the low level of risk automatically means that your returns are lower and so your cost of capital is likely to be a large proportion of your returns and your returns may not completely cover the cost of capital even when you are making money the key thing if you are going to trade or invest on leverage is to understand the terms and costs of your leverage and discount them from any returns that you receive before declaring to yourself that you are profitable it is even more important than usual to know how your positions are doing and whether you are covering your cost of capital when using leverage it is also very important to know the terms of your leverage in detail especially what will happen when and if your credit runs out for whatever reason be it the end of the financing period the length of the loan or your leverage ratio gets too high you should also be aware of the costs of closing out the loan early should you need to do so and how to factor that into your investing decisions

i do n't know canada very well but can offer some general points when considering where to park your emergency fund savings rates are currently low but then so is inflation always bear in mind that inflation decreases the value of your money so if you 're getting 4 interest and inflation is 2 you 're making 2 gross in real terms if you 're getting 2 and inflation is close to zero you 're actually earning a similar amount it 's just the numbers are going up more slowly obviously when and how much tax you pay affects the actual return it 's just worth bearing in mind that low interest and low inflation are actually not that bad a savings environment as they first appear for an emergency fund the key thing is ease of access consider keeping some portion of your savings in an instant access account for those emergencies that happen when the banks are closed in the uk there are various tax free savings options i 'm guessing canada has a few too if so you should explore those options while these may not have attractive headline rates you do n't pay tax on the interest this can make them much more competitive 4 tax free is the same as 5 gross if you would have to pay tax at 20 normally tax free investments have caps so once you 've invested a set amount you ca n't add anymore this may be a consideration if you regularly dip into your emergency fund as you might not easily be able to build it up again my approach is to have about 90 of my rainy day fund in easily accessible but tax free savings this discourages me from spending it unless i really need to i then keep a slush fund sufficient to cover every day disasters boiler packing up needing a hire car for a week etc in instant access accounts

with regards to the stock market there are actually two markets involved here primary market value is created in the primary market where capital is exchanged for a residual interest in an opportunity   as a theoretical example if a person operating solo or with a small team were to discover or create a breakthrough product such as an retro aging pill that person likely would n't have the financial means to fully capitalize on his new found idea   others with more capital may also soon discover his idea or improve upon it and exploit it before he has a chance to for a real life example a person studying at a california university during the 1990s discovered a method to index internet webpages and was approached by some students after a talk on the subject   he returned to his native southern europe country seeking funds to develop the web indexing business and failed to do so   two of the students that approached him found capital readily available from investors in their campus sphere their business is today one of the biggest in the world   they had exchanged part of their residual interest for capital to develop their business the primary market of the stock market works mostly same in creating value   it is also dependent upon the secondary market secondary market the secondary market indicates the day to day value of an enterprise   that market allows shareholders to manage their risk appetites and the enterprise 's operators to execute their shareholders interest for gains   in most cases a secondary market reference will be used for pricing a primary market issuance   without that reference capital would be allocated less efficiently creating additional costs for all involved issuers and investors consider what would happen if you sought to purchase a house and the mortgage lenders had no indication what the property was worth   this would make capital very expensive or possibly deny you access to credit   by having an indication all involved are better off   that is value creating there are some large developed economies equity markets such as that in germany where many large enterprises stay privately held and credit financing mostly from banks is used   the approach has proven successful as well so why do some nations financial markets still rely on capricious stock markets when private credit financing may do just fine in many cases   it 's largely a matter of national culture   countries such as the netherlands the uk and the us have long had active equity markets in continuous use that investors have trusted for centuries conclusion when leaders of an enterprise wish to grow the business to a large size with investment from the stock market they are n't limited by the size of their banks capital   those leaders and their prospective investors will rely on the secondary market to determine values   in addition if the leaders raise equity instead of debt capital they are usually accorded more flexibility to take risks since shareholders usually have their own flexibility to transfer those risks to other investors if for any number of reasons they choose to do so stock markets create value in many other ways   the above are the main ways

not a financial adviser but i think there is some amount of debt that 's ok   so i would n't suggest someone should go $ 200k into debt for a ba in english but if you went somewhat into debt say $ 30k for a major with good job prospects and a high salary it will probably be a good decision   which is exactly what i did and it worked out very well for me   i would advise students to apply to lots of schools with different entry requirements and tuition rates just to see what their financial aid packages are like   very often if a $ 50k a year school really wants you they 'll give you some scholarships to make it more affordable   if they do n't give you enough then you may just need to go to a cheaper school    edit also if your family is n't wealthy like mine you 'll often qualify for federal loans   my loans from 2012 are at 3.5 interest and my financial adviser is telling me to make the minimum payments so i can put more money in stocks

be sure to consider the difference between roth 401 k and standard 401k. the roth 401 k is taxed as income then put into your account so the money you put into the roth 401 k is taxed as income for the current year however any interest you accumulate over the years is not taxed when you withdraw the money   so to break it down you may also want to look into self directed 401 k which can be either standard or roth check if your employer supports this type of account but if you 're self employed or 1099 it may be a good option

so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty say i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the 16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to the bank this is incorrect thinking   on a 30 year loan at year 15 about 2/3 's of the total interest to be paid has been paid and the principal is about 1/3 lower than the original loan amount   you may want to play with some amortization calculators that are freely available to see this in action    if you were to pay off the balance at that point you would avoid paying the remaining 1/3 of interest    consider a 100 k 30 year mortgage at 4.5 in month two the payment breaks down with $ 132 going to principal and $ going to interest   if in month one you had an extra $ 132 and directed it to principal you would save $ in interest   that is a great roi and why it is wonderful to get out of debt as soon as possible    the trouble with this is of course is that most people can barely afford the mortgage payment when it is new so lets look at the same situation in year 15 here $ would go to principal and $ 235 to interest   so you would have to come up with more money to save less interest   it is still a great roi but less dramatic    if you understand the magic of compounding interest then you can understand loans   it is just compounding interest in reverse   it works against you

ultimately you are as stuck as all other investors with low returns which get taxed however there are a few possible you can put up to 15k p.a into a normal isa either cash or stocks shares or a combination if your target is to generate the over 5 years you should maximise the amount you put in an isa then when you come to buy you cash in that part needed to top up your other savings for a deposit i.e. keep the rest in for long term savings the help to buy isa might be helpful but yes there is a limit on the purchase price which in london will restrict you several banks are offering good interest on limited sums in current accounts santander is probably the best you can get 3 taxed on up to 20 k this is a good safe return just open a 123 account arrange to pay out a couple of dds and pay in £ 500 a month you can take the £ 500 straight out again i think lloyds and tsb also offer similar but on much smaller be warned this strategy taken to the limit will involve some complexity checking your various accounts each month after that you will end up trading better returns for greater risk by using more volatile stock market investments rather than cash deposits

depending on the student loan this may be improper usage of the funds   i know the federal loans i received years ago were to be used for education related expenses only   i would imagine most if not all student loans would have the same restrictions bonus answer you must have earned income to contribute to an ira e.g. money received from working see irs publication 590 for details   so if your earmarked money is coming from savings only then you would not be eligible to contribute   as far as whether you can designate student loans for the educational expenses and then used earned income for an ira i would imagine that is fine   however i have not found any documentation to support my assumption

your return from a bond fund corresponds to the return on the underlying bonds minus fees during your holding period so you can buy and sell at any time some funds charge a penalty of 2 or whatever if you sell your fund shares within 30 or 60 days of buying it there are two basic ways to profit from a bond fund 1 you get dividends from the interest paid on the bonds 2 you have a capital gain or loss on the bonds themselves 1 is likely to happen most not all bonds pay interest on time and on a regular basis this component of returns is almost guaranteed 2 there are no guarantees on what the market will pay for bonds at any given time so this component of bonds is not at all guaranteed your total return is the sum of 1 and 2 minus fees since 2 is uncertain your total return is uncertain

unrealistic assumption but i 'll play along ultimately dividends would exist because some innovative shareholder of some company at some time would desire income from their investment and could propose the idea of sharing the profit like minded investors also income could vote for dividends to come into existence or rather vote for a board of directors that supports enactment of the idea in your fictitious world shareholders do still control the corporation right in this world though dividends would n't be called dividends a terrible name that 's too for the inhabitants of that world rather they would institute a quarterly or annual shareholder profit share governments would enact legislation to approve of nay encourage such an innovation because it becomes a new source of recurring income they can tax alternatively even if the idea of a cash dividend did n't occur to anybody in that world investors would realize the stock price is depressed and could propose and vote for the board to institute share buybacks the company repurchasing some portion of shares periodically would provide income to shareholders participating in the buyback if the buyback were they could structure it fairly pro rata participation etc alternatively shareholders would pressure the board or fire them and vote in a new board to put the company up for sale and find a larger buyer who would purchase the shares for cash this ca n't scale forever though so the pressure will increase for solutions like 1 and 2

here 's what you do without on the negative side just for balance a bill when i last had comprehensive insurance it cost something like 3 4 of the value of the car per annum   obviously ymmv enormously but i think that 's somewhere near the middle of the range and i 'm not especially risky   so compared to the total depreciation and running costs of the car it 's actually fairly substantial   over the say 10 years i might keep that car it adds up to a fair slice of what it will take to buy a replacement financial crisis costs i do n't know about you but my insurance went up something like 30 in recent years despite the value insured and the risk going down said by the insurer to be due to market turmoil   so at least hundreds of dollars is just kind of loss and i 'd rather not pay it with the insurer if you have insurance and a loss you have to persuade them to pay out perhaps document the original conditions or the fault perhaps argue about whether their payment is fair   i 've done this for small non automotive claims and it added up to more hassle than the incident itself   obviously all insurers will claim they 're friendly to deal with but until you actually have a big claim you never know moral hazard i know i 'm solely responsible for not having my car crashed or stolen   somehow that just feels better free riders i 've seen people fudge their insurance claims so that things that should n't have been covered were claimed to be   you might have too   buy insurance and you 're paying for them choice insurers are typically going to make the decision for you about whether a claim is or not and in my experience are reluctant or refuse to just give you the cash amount of the claim see also moral hazard   do it yourself and you can choose whether to live with it make a smaller or larger repair or replace the whole vehicle with a second hand one or a brand new one or indeed perhaps do without a vehicle a distraction hopefully by the time you 've been working for a while a vehicle is not a really large fraction of your net worth   if you lose 10 of your net worth it 's not really nice but well you could easily have lost that off the value of your house or your retirement portfolio in recent years   what you actually need to insure is genuinely serious risks that would seriously change your life if they were lost such as your ability to work   for about the same cost as insuring a $ x car you can insure against $ x income every year for the rest of your life and i think it 's far more important if i have a write off accident but walk away i 'll be perfectly happy and obviously liability insurance is important because being hit for $ millions of liabilities could also have a serious impact    coverage for mechanical failures if your car needs a new transmission insurance is n't going to help yet it may cost more than the typical minor collision   save the money yourself and you can manage those costs out of the same bucket flexibility if you save up to replace your car but some other crisis occurs you can choose to put the money towards that   if you have car insurance but you have a family medical thing it 's no help i think the bottom line is insure against costs you could n't cope with by yourself   there are people who need a car but can just barely afford it but if you 're fortunate enough not to be in that case you do n't really need comprehensive insurance

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

as a general rule in many countries pyramid schemes are illegal so do n't plan on getting rich anytime soon by being involved in one   anything you earn through such a scheme is subject to forfeiture because it is ill gotten gains the entire basis of a pyramid scheme is that the focus is principally on recruiting new not selling a product or service   i would strongly advise you to find a different way to riches    multi level marketing very rarely makes much money for anyone except the first people in the food chain and the odds of finding such an early stage opportunity are exceedingly small   for every successful mlm program there are probably 25 that never make it off the launch pad   be honest in asking yourself if it was really that easy why would n't everyone just get into mlm   it 's more hype than substance   do you know who buys most of the product   the newest people who drink the because they 're convinced they need to have plenty of inventory on hand for their potential customers   i ca n't tell you how many people i know who spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on buying product they never managed to sell   it 's much tougher than people think even with a good product

what you are saying is a very valid concern   after the flash crash many institutions in the us replaced true market orders where tag and has no price with deep in the money limit orders under the hood after the cftc sec joint advisory commission raised concerns about the use of market orders in the case of large hft traders and concerns on the lack of liquidity that caused market orders that found no limit orders to execute on the other side of the trade driving the prices of blue chip stocks into the pennies   we also applaud the cftc requesting comment regarding whether it is    appropriate to restrict large order execution design that results in    disruptive trading in particular we believe there are questions    whether it is ever appropriate to permit large order algorithms that    employ unlimited use of market orders or that permit at    prices which are a dramatic percentage below the present market price    without a pause for human review so although you still see a market order on the front end it is transformed to a very aggressive limit in the back end however doing this change manually by selling at price 0 or buying at may backfire since it may trigger fat finger checks and prevent your order from reaching the market   for example bats exchange   rejects orders that are priced too aggressively and do n't comply with the range of valid prices   if you want your trade to execute right now and you are willing to take slippage in order to get fast execution sending a market order is still the best alternative

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

the preferred accounts are designed to hope you do one of several things pay one day late   then charge you all the deferred interest many people think if they put $ x a month aside then pay just before the 6 months 12 or no payment before 2014 period ends then i will be able to afford the computer carpet or furniture the interest rate they will charge you if you are late will be buried in the fine print but expect it to be very high pay on time but now that you have a card with their logo on it   so now you feel that you should buy the accessories from them they hope that you become a long time customer they want to make money on your next computer also their bill me later option on that site as essentially the same as the preferred account in the end you will have another line of credit they will do a credit check the impact both positive and negative on your credit picture is discussed in other questions   because two of the three options you mentioned in your question cash debit card imply that you have enough cash to buy the computer today there is no reason to get another credit card to finance the purchase the delayed payment with the preferred account will save you about 10 dollars 2000 1 interest 0.5 years   the choice of store might save you more money though with apple there are fewer places to get legitimate discounts here are your options how to get the limit increased you can ask for a temporary increase in the credit limit or you can ask for a permanent one some credit cards can do this online others require you to talk to them if they are going to agree to this it can be done in a few minutes some individuals on this site have even been able to send the check to the credit card company before completing the purchase thus increasing their credit limit ymmv i have no idea if it works   a good reason to use the existing credit card instead of the debit card is if the credit card is a rewards card the extra money or points can be very nice just make sure you pay it back before the bill is due in fact you can send the money to the credit card company the same day the computer arrives in the mail   having the transaction on the credit card can also get you purchase protection and some cards automatically extend the warranty

if you or they feel uneasy about you simply paying more rent than them for equal usage you can work out an agreement where they pay in other ways for example i once lived with someone that made about double what i did and so he paid more rent than i did in exchange i was responsible for cleaning the kitchen if your roommates hate cleaning then you could substitute something like running errands cooking or looking after plants landscaping if they have some specialized skills then they might be able to provide those instead car maintenance financial management etc of course you 'll want to agree ahead of time on what the conditions of satisfaction for the task are such as how often the kitchen will have to be cleaned and what the definition of clean is you also ca n't be a jerk and make their job extra hard such as by completely trashing the kitchen every night   obviously it will depend on the temperament of your roommates whether or not they 'll be happy with this or feel insulted being the help it worked for us because it was a task he hated and one i did n't mind and it kept me from feeling like i was off him i would feel them out when you propose a possible rent and utilities split if they feel like it 's an unfair burden on you but they ca n't afford more then you could suggest this as a way for everyone to contribute equally whatever you decide to do do n't hold it over their heads that you pay more agree on something that everyone feels is fair whatever that is if you want a concession due to paying more such as you get the garage get to pick the art on the walls whatever then agree to that up front then accept that you 've made a fair deal and they do n't owe you anything beyond what you 've all agreed to it 's awful to feel like you live in someone else 's home and that you are getting into ever deeper debt with a close friend or significant other and it will breed resentment if you ca n't do that then do n't share an apartment with them at all the most important thing is that everyone feels it 's fair regardless of the numbers if you can not get to that agreement through dollars alone you can have them contribute to the home in other ways such as cleaning cooking or performing maintenance just make sure that everyone truly does feel it 's fair and that you are all equals

you ca n't short a stock unless there is someone willing and able to lend shares to you and there are several reasons why that might not be the case first is a new stock which means that no one has held it very long it 's much easier to short ibm or exxon mobil where there are some long term holders who would like to earn a little extra money lending you their shares but if everyone involved is busy buying or selling the stock there wo n't be many people to lend it that 's not manipulation that 's just the market another reason may be a large short interest that is many others have shorted it before you that 's dangerous for you because if some lenders want to pull their shares off the market they can cause a short squeeze that will drive the price much higher   and stock shortages can be orchestrated by the company or large investors to artificially drive the price higher unless you have a lot of experience do n't try shorting small cap stocks try to gain some experience with large caps like ibm or exxon mobil first those are stocks that people at least ca n't play games with you will win or lose based on the market itself

which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover emergency funds are for emergencies which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and ca n't be covered out of normal cash flow   oil changes are not an emergency and should be part of your normal budget   car house repairs and doctor visits might be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency e.g. do i need to fix this now or can i save up and fix it for known predictable expenses that are infrequent christmas birthdays car insurance home insurance taxes if it 's not part of your mortgage payment i use an escrow account   i calculate how much i 'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that i have enough to cover each item   you could do something similar for minor doctor visits car repairs etc   estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month if you find you 're spending more than you thought just increase the amount   you can use envelopes for each type of expense have a separate checking account for those whatever   the point is to set it aside and make sure you have enough left over to cover your known expenses the whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay cash for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest late fees etc

enrolled agents typically specialize only in tax matters   their status allows them to represent clients before the irs which a cpa can also do see the irs site regarding enrolled agents their focus is much narrower than a cpa and you would only hire them for advice or representation with tax related matters   e.g. you 'd not hire an enrolled agent to do an external audit   a cpa is a much broader certification covering accounting in general of which taxes are only a portion a cpa may or may not specialize in tax matters so if you have a tax related issue especially an audit review or appeal you may want to query a prospective cpa as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients appeals etc you would likely be better off with an ea than a cpa who tax work and specializes in other things such as financial the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting audits etc then you 'd want to talk with a cpa as opposed to an ea

bookkeeping and double entry accounting is really designed for tracking the finances of a single entity it sounds like you 're trying to use it to keep multiple entities information which may somewhat work but is n't really going to be the easiest to understand here 's a few approaches in this approach the books are entirely from your perspective so if you 're holding onto money that really belongs to your kids then what you 've done is you 're taking a loan from them this means that you should record it as a liability on your books if you received $ 300 of which $ 100 was actually yours $ 100 belongs to kid 1 and thus is a loan from him and $ 100 belongs to kid 2 and thus is a loan from her you 'd record it just that way note that you only received $ 100 of income since that 's the only money that 's yours and the other $ 200 you 're only holding on behalf of your kids when you give the money to your kids or spend it on their behalf then you debit the liability accordingly and credit the petty cash or other account you spent it from if you wanted to do this in excruciating detail then your kids could each have their own set of books in which they would see a transfer from their own income garage sale account into their assets held by parents account for this you just each of your asset accounts into subaccounts tracking how much money each of you has in it this lets you treat the whole family as one single entity sharing in the income expenses etc it lets you see the whole pool of money as being the family 's but also lets you track internally some value of assets for each person whenever you spend money you need to record which subaccount it came from and it could be more challenging if you actually need to record income or expenses separately per person for some sort of tax reasons say unless you also break up each income and expense account per person as well in which case it may be easier just to have each person keep their entirely separate set of books i do n't see a whole lot of advantages but i 'll mention it because you suggested using equity accounts equity is designed for tracking how much capital each investor contributes to the entity and for tracking a household it can be hard for that to make a lot of sense though i suppose it can be done from a math perspective equity is treated exactly like liabilities in the accounting equation so you could end up using it a lot like in my approach 1 where equity represents how much you owe each of the kids but in that case i 'd find it simpler to just go ahead and treat them as liabilities but if it makes you feel better to just use the word equity rather than liability to represent that the kids are investing in the household or the like go right ahead if you 're going to look at the books from your perspective and the kids as investing in it the transaction would look like this and it 's really all handled in the same way an approach 1 if on the other hand you really want the books to represent the family then you 'd need to have the family 's books really look more like a partnership this is getting a bit out of my league but i 'd imagine it 'd be something like this that is to say the family make the sale and has the money and the shareholders could see it as such but do n't have any obvious direct claim to the money since there has n't been a distribution to them yet any assets would just be assumed to be split three ways if it 's an equal partnership then when being spent the entity would have an expense transaction of dividend or the like where it distributes the money to the shareholders so that they could do something with it alternatively you 'd just have the capital be contributed and then any income would have to be handled on the individual books of the investors involved as it would represent that they make the money and then contributed it to the family books this approach seems much more complicated than i 'd want to do myself though

when you invest in stocks there are two possible ways to make money many people speculate just on the stock price which would result in a gain or loss but only once you have resold the shares others do n't really care about the stock price they get dividends every so often and hopefully the return will be better than other types of investments if you 're in there for the long run you do not really care what the price of the stock is it is often highly volatile and often completely disconnected from anything so it 's not because today you have a theoretical gain because the current stock price is higher than your buying price that you will effectively realise that gain when you sell need i the numerous crashes that prevented this from happening returns will often be more spectacular on share resale than on dividends but it goes both ways you can lose a lot if you resell at the wrong time dividends tend to be a bit more stable and unless the company goes bankrupt or a few other unfortunate events you still hold shares in the company even if the price goes down and you could still get dividends and you can still resell the stock on top of that of course not all companies distribute dividends in that case you only have the hope of reselling at a higher price or that the company will distribute dividends in the future welcome to the next bubble

shifting money from one person to another does not increase overall spending and it definitely does not increase the amount of productive work done   new or expanding businesses create new jobs and increase overall wealth   if rich people really sit on vaults full of cash as you imply it would have a deflationary effect increasing the real wages of the poor this does not happen however rich peoples wealth will either be spent invested or given away the same as the poor do with their money

also keep in mind that with an all cash offer they get their money now and not spread over x many years which means they can reinvest it now rather than piece meal across the term of whatever the loan would be presuming the bank would be financing the house themselves additionally with an all cash offer there end to be fewer lawyers at the table fewer parties total so the process can generally proceed faster

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

i used to use before they went paid and started concentrating on closed end funds these days my source of information is spread out the primary source about the instrument etf itself is backed by information from morningstar and yahoo finance for comparison charts google finance ca n't be beat for actual solid details about a specific etf would check read the prospectus from the managing firm itself one other comment never trust a site that tells you which securities to buy the idea is that you need sources of solid information about financial instruments to make a decision not a site that makes the decision for you this is due to the fact that everyone has different strategies and goals for their money and a single site saying buy x sell y will probably lead you to lose your money

defined benefit pensions are generally seen as valuable and hard to replace by investing on your own so my default assumption would be to keep that pension unless you think there 's a significant risk the pension fund will become insolvent in which case the earlier you can get out the better obviously you need to look at the numbers what is a realistic return you could get by investing that 115 k to compare like with like what real investment returns after subtracting inflation are needed for it to provide you with $ income year after age 60 also consider that the defined benefit insulates you from multiple kinds of risk remember that most of your assets are outside the pension and subject to all these risks already do you want to add to that risk by taking this money out of your pension one intermediate strategy to look at again for the purposes of comparison is to take the money now invest it for 10 years without withdrawing anything then buy an annuity at age 60 if you 're single canadian annuity rates for age 60 appear to be between 4 5 without index linking it may not even be possible to get an index linked annuity even without the index linking you 'd need to grow the $ 115 k to about $ 240 k in 10 years implying taking enough risks to get a return of 7.6 per year and you would n't have index linking so your income would gradually drop in real terms

an answer from a psychological viewpoint money does not have a linear value to people if you have $ 10.000 losing one dollar does n't really matter losing all $ 10.000 is more than 10.000 times as bad as a simple example of a non linear function let 's use the square root function let 's say that having $ 100 is ten times as good as having $ 1 and having $ 10000 is ten times as good as having $ 100   now this means that an insurance may have a negative expectation when expressed in dollars since the insurance company is making a profit but the expected value still can be positive let 's assume the premium is $ 150 and there 's a 1 chance it will pay $ 10.000 clearly in dollars the expected loss is $ 50 but in the value to you using that same square root function the premium is just and the expected payout is 1   intuitive you wo n't notice the premium if you 're rich enough that you do n't need the insurance but once you do need the insurance you could now be so poor that you appreciate the payout as a side effect this also shows that you want an insurance with a fairly high deductible if a $ 10.000 loss is a risk you can bear then you do n't need insurance for losses in the order of $ 100 and that 's even ignoring the fact that such small payouts have relatively high administrative costs for insurance companies which is why the premium discount for high deductibles can be high

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

obviously the best thing financially would be to continue using your present car unless it impacts you financially on a regular basis for example maintenance or breakdowns impacting your ability to work an unreliable car also impacts your freedom for example preventing you from taking road trips you might want to take or taking up free time with maintenance give thought to what it is about your present car that you dislike both to determine the value you gain from a new car and what 's most important to you anytime you buy a car you generally lose thousands of dollars simply driving it off the lot this is the profit which goes to dealers salespeople etc and not part of the actual value of the car cars also depreciate over time with most of the depreciation happening in the first few years of operation many of the newer model cars have additional expenses for example replacement $ 200 keys or electronic systems that can only be repaired at special facilities in addition if you have insurance other than the minimum third party required by law consider the rate increases and add up the long term impact of that imagine you had invested that money instead at 8 interest over the lifetime of the car if you do n't have insurance consider what you would do in the unfortunate situation where you were at fault in a collision could you afford to lose your investment even with safe responsible driving there is always the potential for road weather conditions or mechanical failures if you determine there is sufficient value to be gained from changing vehicles i would recommend that you buy a vehicle with history from someone privately doing appropriate background checks and consulting friends or family who know about vehicles and can provide feedback do research into the models which interest you ahead of time read online reviews every vehicle generally has known advantages and disadvantages which can take years to discover so buying an older vehicle gives you the advantage of knowing what to expect i would say there is probably a reasonable middle ground between using a 1991 vehicle you do n't like that 's as old as you are and getting a relatively new model look at what you value in the vehicle consider all the costs and find the balance that works best for you vehicles from 2000 2005 years are quite affordable and still 10 15 years newer than your car

you need a good erp or at least ii implementation which means you need someone very familiar with or someone who becomes very familiar with your business to get it done right   those do n't come setup for some unique business as an off the shelf thing and while many are customizable you can easily end up in customization hell both dollar wise operation interruption wise and technical wiki   but this really begs for someone to ask why are you not maintaining amp updating your existing custom software   why attempt to ditch something that is hopefully working fairly well for the highly risky prospect of some entirely new untested system     is the business logic and the operation of the old system working well   while it might seem to be costly in terms of time amp money your best bet in my experience would be to get a really good programmer possibly with a cheap assistant temp helper to do some grunt work for him to document maintain and then slowly upgrade your current already in place software and/or rewrite it to use modern db 's web interfaces etc    because changing out your system is like replacing all the and in your body it will not be a pleasant experience and the patient may not survive the operation even if the implementation is a labeled a success the business is littered with the of erp victims   the big dogs have three huge upfront cost areas 1 the consultants in various teams stages 2 the underlying database software costs initial licenses 3 the ongoing licenses 4 the ongoing customization fixes if you ever want to upgrade alas most of the consultants who do customizations do n't do document it in a way that facilitates easy upgrades in part because that would significantly reduce their income

it is going to save you more money in the long run to pay at once with cash if you take out a loan you will pay interest on the balance costing you money if you pay off the balance immediately there is no difference between the options and your question becomes irrelevant   there is no credit rating benefit to placing large purchases on your cards especially since your credit is fine my advice is to pay in cash in this case mostly because it makes you feel the purchase this is what you are describing in your question this instinct helps you recognize potential problems instead of masking them with debt questions like do i need this   am i myself financially with this purchase   am i holding enough cash on hand for emergencies you may be fine in these areas but i would still argue that cash makes you a better buyer because the expense feels much more significant making you more cautious and   you are right to feel these things before dropping a large sum of money let it inform you and help you make better decisions do n't mask it or be paralyzed by it

one way to do these sorts of calculations is to use the spreadsheet version of irs form 1040 available here   this is provided by a private individual and is not an official irs tool but in practice it is usually accurate enough for these purposes   you may have to spend some time figuring out where to enter the info   however if you enter your self employment income on schedule c this spreadsheet will calculate the self employment tax as well as the income tax   an advantage is that it is the full 1040 so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to enter ordinary w-2 income even capital gains etc of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this but in my experience the excel 1040 is more convenient as most websites and tax prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad hoc way for purposes like tax estimation   you can do whatever works for you but i would recommend taking a look at the excel 1040   it is a surprisingly useful tool

i do n't disagree that many times psychologists can or even present fabricated claims about human behavior only in an effort to rack in some extra money    however any close to normal person can see that there are a whole lot of people with serious issues that nobody mentions to them or they themselves are afraid to acknowledge because they do n't want to deal with all of the drama    anyway let 's see how legitimate the 25 of americans suffer from mental illness claim is     newsroom    a new national report reveals that million american adults aged 18 or older or 20 percent of this age group experienced mental illness in the past year     2   hen applied to the 2004 u.s. census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older this figure translates to million though mental disorders are widespread in the population the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion about 6 percent or 1 in 17 who suffer from a serious mental illness    you can find countless studies like this online    now obviously somebody is thinking about pointing out at this point that all of these studies were conducted by psychologists or only trying to validate their initial claims and ultimately for economic benefit and well if you that 's your argument then yes you are absolutely right that there is absolutely no way prove that the 25 statistic is correct    and just to be clear the term mental illness in this to the above studies is really anything from anxiety to depression to personality disorders and even more social things like compulsive lying obviously the definition is very broad and that is precisely why the is so shocking

most of the time your tax only reduces by the current marginal rate meaning you would only reduce your tax by 28 to 25 depending on which part of the bracket you 're in however in the area around 100k there are cases where reductions will have more of a marginal effect than that   you 'll never reduce it more than 100 but you can reduce it by 35 40 despite being in the 25 bracket that is because of certain deductions and credits which phase out beginning around things like the ira deduction the child tax credit childcare tax credit and similar   since many of them phase out in this range additional dollars cost you your marginal rate 25 plus the percentage of the credits or deductions which phase out here which might bring you up another 10 or so

if i understand your question you 're misunderstanding the buy sell spread and at least in this instance seem to be in an unfortunate situation where the spread is quite large the polish zloty gbp ideal exchange rate is around   thus when actually exchanging currency you should expect to pay a bit more than zloty to get one pound sterling and you should expect to get a bit less than zloty in exchange for one pound sterling   that 's because you 're giving the bank its cut both for operations and so that it has a reason to hold onto some zloty that it ca n't lend out   it sounds like barclay 's has a large spread buy sell   i would guess british banks do n't need all that many zloty so you have a higher spread than you would for usd or eur other currency exchange companies or banks particularly those who are in the primary business of converting money may have a smaller spread and be more willing to do it for you   also it looks like the polish banks are willing to do it at a better rate certainly they 're giving you more zloty for one pound sterling so it seems likely the other way would be better as well though since they 're a polish bank it 's certainly easier for them to give you zloty so this may be less true   barclay 's is certainly giving you a better deal on pounds for a zloty than they are zloty for a pound in terms of how far off their spread is from the ideal

please find out whether you are considered to be a tax resident of the us from the date that you received the permanent immigrant visa or from the date that you first enter the us on that visa if the former and you received the visa after april 30 you might be a part year resident of india for indian income tax purposes for the current tax year you need to convert your bank accounts including fixed deposits the fds that you mention to nro accounts as soon as possible you will need to keep at least one nro account open for a year or more to receive the final interest payments on your fds as well as the proceeds of cashing in the fds not to mention any refunds of indian income tax that may be due to you for last year or the current year once you are done with all these follow the procedures outlined in this excellent answer by to transfer the money to your us account   at this point you can close the nro account if you wish as 's comment says it is not a good idea to bring a large sum of cash with you unless you are really really paranoid about banking channels note that if you insist on bringing cash whether it is inr or usd or negotiable instruments checks or bank drafts with you when you land in the us these will have to be declared on entry if the total exceeds us$ 10k. there is no limit to how much you can bring with you as long as you declare it transfers of your own money from india to the us is not taxable income to you in the us and income tax will already have been paid withheld on that money in india and so there is no income tax liability in india either on the sum transferred

first of all never ask a realtor for advice the realtor represents the seller 's advice above is by far the most accurate of the previous answers the first step is to estimate the market look at past sales in the neighborhood over time and from them estimate the prospects for the house at different time durations based on other sales how fast do you think the house will sell at a given price 60 days 90 days a year if a house is high priced that means the seller is prepared to wait he is saying i am happy to wait a year to find somebody who will pay this next who is the owner young professional retiring couple landlord flipper who is it the more you know about the owner the better everybody has a time table you need to find out what that is next what is your timetable you need the house by the end of the month or by the end of the year or never which is it objectively rate the house and minuses good houses are those which everybody else hates and you love you will get the best price there assuming you need to find a house in 90 days based on these considerations determine the lowest price you think the owner will accept in a 30-day time frame make a written offer with an address and email no phone number if he comes back with a counter offer ignore it if for some reason a realtor has your number and calls you tell them my written offer speaks for itself i have nothing further to say it is very important not to entertain haggling or counter offers do n't even pick up the phone he has your written offer he can email or write you i accept   if the move onto your 2 choice and make a more aggressive offer if that does n't work go to choice 3 and accept the listed price this strategy may seem counter intuitive because the natural tendency for people is to want to communicate trust me the way to succeed in a negotiation is to not communicate make your offer and that is that that is the pro way to do it and will produce the best result for a short term long term situation if you are an investor flipper or have a lot of time to wait spend you can use a different strategy which involves pressuring the seller what you do here is find a property you want in which the owner is vulnerable that means someone who is old bankrupt out of work indicted and on their way to prison or already in prison etc bank owned properties fall into this category in this case you figure out the 6-month price or however long you are willing to work on it then you the person become their buddy visit them in prison take the bank officer to lunch show up on holidays invite them to thanksgiving start a relationship every two weeks you them want to sell yet want to sell yet you basically harass them until they maybe it takes 6 months maybe it takes 2 years eventually they will give in by this means you can get a much better deal than in strategy 1 above but it takes a lot more time and effort and is appropriate more for an investor

as i understand it the correct price is any point between the minimum the seller is willing to accept and the maximum the buyer is willing to pay   these values are influenced by a number of factors including market conditions cost of production and immediate need there 's also a sense of fairness and expectation that influences these numbers people do n't want to pay a much higher price or accept a much lower price than they think the other party should agree to   for example in the event of a sudden actual or anticipated shortage in some commodity consumer good say gasoline it would make sense for sellers to raise the price significantly in the short term consumers of gasoline are very price and most will pay more than double the usual price to obtain it this behavior is commonly seen as unfair on the part of the seller to the point that certain variations of it are illegal in some jurisdictions economists would describe it as rational   oddly people do n't seem to be as upset about buyers offering low prices in the event of a sudden increase in highly motivated sellers when people do tend to get upset is if the buyers have a profit motive they know the price decrease is temporary and are willing to buy and hold the asset to make a profit later even so it seems to me that it 's much rarer for such behavior to be illegal   the underlying objection as far as i can tell is to what is perceived as greed

i think part of the confusion is due to the age of the term and how money has changed over time relative to being backed by precious metals vs using central banks etc historically because historically the coin itself was precious metal if a change occurred between the face value of the coin and value of the precious metal itself the holder of the coin was less affected since they have the precious metal already in hand they could always trade it based on the metal value instead of the face value otoh if you buy a note worth an the current price of ounce of gold and the price of gold goes up and then the holder wants to redeem the note they end up with less than an ounce of gold in the more modern age   the main concern is the cost to borrow funds to put money into circulation or the gain when it goes out of circulation   the big difference between the two is that bills tend stay in circulation until they wear out have to be bought back and replaced   coins on the other hand last longer but have a tendency to drop out of circulation due to collectors especially with collectible series coins that the mint seems to love to issue lately   this means that bills issued tend to stay in circulation while only a percentage of coins stays in circulation   so the net effect on the money supply is different for the two and since modern is all about the cost to put money in circulation it is different in the case of coins where some percentage will not remain circulating

that sounds about right however and this is just a quibble it 's not 90 m notional of swap or at least i 've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument generally i hear the word exposure in this case the of shares purchased at a specific index level so 90 mm exposure in s&amp;p 500 at today 's closing price is = a swap on 37 shares   if you want to maintain the 90 mm exposure month to month you will structure the instrument with a variable notional at each reset the swap 's of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90 mm exposure   you rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90 mm figure   as a final note the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap 's initial index levels depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index

i 've had the same thoughts recently and after reading investing at level 3 by james i believe his thesis that for the passive investor you 're giving up too much if you 're not 100 in equities he is clear to point out that you need to be well aware of your withdrawal horizons and has specific tactics for shifting the portfolio when you know you must have the money in the next five years and would n't want to pull money out when you 're at a market low the kicker for me was shifting your thought to a plotting a straight line of reasonable expectations on your return then you do n't worry about how far down you are from your high or up from your low but you measure yourself against the expected return and you 'll find some real grounding you 're investing for the long term so you 're going to see 2 3 bear markets that is n't the the time to get cold feet and react stay put and it will come back the market gets back to the reasonable expectations very quickly as he confirms in all the bear markets and recessions of any note he gives guidelines for a passive investing strategy to leverage this mentality and talks about into an active strategy but does n't go into great depth so if you 're looking to invest more passively this book may be enough to get you rolling with thinking differently than the traditional 70/30 split

the june 2014 issue of barclays wealth 's compass magazine had a very nice succinct article on this topic value investing does a rules based approach work   it examines the performance of value and growth styles of investment in the msci world and s&p500 for a few decades back and reveals a surprisingly complicated picture depending on sector region and time period their summary is basically a closer look however shows that the overall success of value    strategies derives mainly from the 1970s and 1980s in the us value has underperformed growth for over 25 years    since peaking in july 1988 globally value experienced a 30 setback    in the late 1990s so that there are now periods with a length of    nearly 13 years over which growth has outperformed so the answer to does it beat the market is   it depends update in response to comment below the question of risk adjusted returns is interesting   to quote another couple of fragments from the piece since december 1974 msci world value has outperformed growth by    2.6 annually with lower risk this outperformance on a risk adjusted    basis is the so called value premium that eugene fama and kenneth    french first identified in 1992 and that outperformance has however come with more risk historical    volatility of the pure style indices has been 21 22 compared to 16    for the market from a maximum drawdown perspective the 69 drop    of pure value during the financial crisis exceeded the 51 drop of the    overall market

is that indicator can only be used for short term trade first of all indicator works perfect during trends and oscillator works perfectly in the range flat market so indicator can be used for long term as well as short term i mean if it is a range market using this or any other indicator will not help much so it you should consider market direction first if it can be used to long term trade is there something i need to change from the parameters used like only using the parameters are there to change them of course you can change them based on your trading style considering my statement above does not mean that trading is very easy i never use indicators alone to make trading decisions it is always good to use oscillator to filter out bad trading signals

frequently selling and buying properties is generally not advisable in germany due to the high cost for property purchase tax and land registration fees you can generally assume that ever time you trade homes you pay about 10 extra so it is likely a good idea to keep your property and rent it out while you do n't need it so you can use the rent to pay for your new room that 's especially true if you expect the property to increase in value also due to the low interest rate right now real estate is practically the only good capital investment a 85k asset which makes you each year is a return of investment of any financial asset promising you that kind of dividend at the moment is likely equivalent to gambling yes i ignored maintenance costs but it 's still a really good deal if you want to rent out your flat as stress free as possible give it to a property management company in exchange for a percentage of the monthly rent they will take care of all the small stuff like hiring to fix broken toilets you might still have to pay for really expensive investments though like replacing a leaking roof but when something like that happens you should have no issue to finance it with a loan because you have a real estate as a security   however keep in mind that the german tenancy law might make it difficult but not impossible to get rid of the tenant in case you want to move back into the apartment google for more details should you decide after your study that you do n't want to move back you can always sell the flat with the tenant but rented properties usually get far lower prices on the real estate market than empty ones regarding covering your cost of living besides rent during your studies if you are eligible for state sponsored student loan you should take it because it 's an offer simply too good to refuse it 's literally free money but unfortunately you are not because you own too much real estate wealth you are not living in but you should ask your bank for a loan backed by said property that way you will likely pay far less interest than with a regular private student loan which is n't backed by anything except the hope for a relevant degree

i 've never heard of a loan product like that yes if they keep the funds in an account it is no risk to the bank but they would essentially need to go through the loan process twice for the same loan when you pick a house they need to reevaluate everything along with and approving the house   even if you did find a bank that would do this for you there are a few problems with this scheme you would be paying interest before you have a need for this money negating the savings you might achieve if the interest rates go up in addition your balance will go down as payments are deducted from your loan and when you finally find a home to buy you might not have enough for the house you want you 'll need to borrow more than you need which will further negate any possible savings   it is impossible to know how fast rates will climb if i were you i would stick to saving for your down payment and just get the best rate you can when you are ready to buy   another potential idea for you is to lock an interest rate when you apply for a mortgage the interest rate is often locked for as much as 60 days to protect the borrower in the event that the rates go up you could ask the bank if you can pay a fee to lock the rate even longer i do n't know if that is possible or not and of course the fee would eat into your potential savings

in a traditional ira contributions are often tax deductible for instance if a taxpayer contributes $ 4,000 to a traditional ira and is in the twenty five percent marginal tax bracket then a $ 1,000 benefit $ 1,000 reduced tax liability will be realized for the year so that 's why they tax you as income because they did n't tax that income before if a taxpayer expects to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than during the working years then this is one advantage for using a traditional ira vs a roth distributions are taxed as ordinary income so it depends on your tax bracket   update for comment currently you may have heard on the news about the fiscal cliff cnbc at the end of the year this is due to the fact that the bush tax cuts are set to expire and if they expire many tax rates will change but here is the info as of right now dividends from 2003 to 2007 qualified dividends were taxed at 15 or 5 depending on the individual 's ordinary income tax bracket and from 2008 to 2012 the tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 0 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 ordinary income tax brackets after 2012 dividends will be taxed at the taxpayer 's ordinary income tax rate regardless of his or her tax bracket if the bush tax cuts are allowed to expire reference wikipedia capital gains tax rates can be seen here the capital gains tax rate is relative to your ordinary income tax rate for example this year long term gains will be 0 if you fall in the 15 ordinary tax bracket note these rates can change every year so any future rates might be different from the current year

would n't this be part of your investing strategy to know what price is considered a good price for the stock   if you are going to invest in company abc should n't you have some idea of whether the stock price of $ 30 $ 60 or $ 100 is the bargain price you want   i 'd consider this part of the due diligence if you are picking individual stocks   mutual funds can be a bit different in automatically doing fractional shares and not quite as easy to analyze as a company 's financials in a sense i 'm more concerned with the fact that you do n't seem to have a good idea of what the price is that you are willing to buy the stock so that you take advantage of the volatility of the market etfs would be similar to mutual funds in some ways though i 'd probably consider the question that may be worth considering here is how much do you want to optimize the price you pay versus adding $ x to your position each time   i 'd probably consider estimating a ballpark and then setting the limit price somewhere within that   i would n't necessarily set it to the maximum price you 'd be willing to pay unless you are trying to ride a hot etf using some kind of momentum strategy   the downside of a momentum strategy is that it can take a while to work out the and i do n't use one though i do remember a from msn money that did that kind of trading regularly

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

there 's no such thing as true passive income you are being paid the risk free rate to delay consumption i.e. the super low rate you are getting on savings accounts and cds and a higher rate to bear risk you will not find truly risk free investments that earn more than the types of investments you have been looking at most likely you will not keep up with inflation in risk free investments for a person who is very risk averse but wants to make a little more money than the risk free rate the solution is not to invest completely in slightly risky things   instead the best thing you can do is invest partially in a fully diversified portfolio   a diversified portfolio containing stocks bonds etc will earn you the most return for the given amount of risk   if you want very little risk put very little in that portfolio and keep the rest in your cds put 90 of your money in a cd or something and the other 10 in stocks bonds   or choose a different percentage you can also buy real assets like real estate but you will find yourself taking a different type of risk and doing a different type of work with those assets

if what you are paying in interest on the debt is a higher percentage than what your investments are returning the best investment you can make is to pay off the debt if you 're lucky enough to be paying historically low rates as i am on my mortgage and getting good returns on the investments so the latter is the higher percentage   the balance goes the other way and you 'd want to continue paying off the debt relatively slowly essentially treating it as a leveraged investment   if you are n't sure paying off the debt should probably be the default

it is very likely that the fund paid out a dividend in the form of reinvested shares   this happens with many funds especially as we come to the end of the year here 's a simplified example of how it works   assume you invested $ 1000 and bought 100 units at $   ignoring the daily price fluctuations if the fund paid out a 20 dividend you would get $ 200 and the unit price would drop to $   assuming you chose to reinvest your dividends you would automatically purchase another $ 200 worth of units at the new price so 25 more units   you would now have 125 units $ = $ 1000 invested in your example notice that you now have more shares than you originally purchased but that the price dropped significantly   your market value is above what you originally invested so there was probably also a bit of a price increase for the day   you should see the dividend transaction listed somewhere in your account just to confirm i did a quick search on and found that they did indeed pay a dividend yesterday

well it also discusses other traditional valuation techniques such as the economic profit model and it has a chapter on real option valuation but i would not label those exotic valuation methods however i would say that the cfa challenge is much about standard valuation methods due to the limited page limit and considering that there should properly also be an analysis of the external and internal environment to determine the future prospects of the given company

if you were looking to maximize your ability to save in a qualified plan why not setup a 401 k plan in company a and keep the sep in b setup the 401 k in a such that any employee can contribute 100 of their salary   then take a salary for around 19k year assuming under age 50 so you can contribute and have enough to cover ss taxes    then continue to move dividends to company a and continue the sep in b.   this way if you are below age 50 you can contribute 54 k sep limit + 18 k ira limit + 5500 roth income dependent to a qualified plan

yeah you 're right    which is interesting in this case anyway in that many analysts were highlighting the lack of fundamentals supporting the ipo price to me that speaks to the willingness of the underwriters to ignore that lack of fundamentals and perhaps base the value on something else e.g. zuck 's a he 'll figure it out    i guess my point is that the lack of foundation that the market has since priced into the share price was not hidden from the underwriters

yes this extra income would be taxed at your marginal rate because it is increasing your total income this does not necessarily apply to all income however capital gains are taxed at a different rate depending on the amount of extra work you may wish to consider setting up a corporation corporations are taxed entirely differently this would also give you the opportunity to write off far more of your expenses but be aware of double taxation investopedia has a good article on double taxation the issue is that the corporation must pay taxes on the revenue and then when you take out the money either as salary or dividends you personally will pay tax it may leave you better off even with the double taxation dividends are taxed at a lower rate than your marginal tax rate generally and you can write off much more inside a corporation if considering this talk to an accountant and discuss your expected revenue from consulting the accountant should be able to quantify the costs and benefits

what 's relevant to whether you accept the offer should be the compensation package including salary and benefits they 're offering the work you 'll be doing and the conditions in which you 'll be doing it the communication history between you and the recruiter is n't really that relevant since you probably wo n't deal with the recruiter once you 're hired so if this is a job you want to do at the level of compensation offered accept the offer if not do n't if you suspect that they actually could be willing to negotiate for a higher salary despite already saying that they are n't you could test this by declining the offer and saying that that last $ 5 k is the only sticking point but only if your intent really is to walk away from the offer as it stands

it would be preferable to purchase a bond with a negative yield if the negative yield was the smallest compared to similar financial securities the purchase or sale of a security is rarely a mutually exclusive event   an individual may have personal reasons or a desire to contribute to the activity the bond is financing   to an entity the negative yield bond may be part of a cost averaging plan diversification strategy a single leg of a multi leg transaction or possibly to aid certainty as a hedge in a pairs trade   and of course there may be other unique situations specific to the entity said another way is the queen of a good card   it depends on the game being played and what is in your hand

honestly i think the best thing the government could do at this point is to stop with stimulus spending and let the market pick the winners and losers the government is horrible at this because it just throws money where it makes sense politically not economically which is what got us into this mess in the first place   obama is repeating all of the same mistakes made by bush but to a larger degree when the dot com bubble burst bush amp greenspan artificially lowered interest rates to 1 and printed money to stimulate the economy the goal was not to create a housing bubble like what happened but rather to get people to invest in stocks again instead the people who had been bitten by stocks looked around and saw that housing had a history of increasing in value w/o nearly as much risk of loss so they invested in housing instead clinton 's and bush 's policies of guaranteeing loans to lower income families for the purpose of buying homes also contributed to this and the next thing you know housing prices boomed because there was a massive demand thus leading to the housing market crash of   but that 's not all you see because as people started to believe that their homes would increase in value by huge amounts they started spending more risking more on the stock market and generally going into massive debt because they felt wealthy   so in 2008 when the housing bubble crashed so did the stock bubble and the personal debt bubble leaving many home owners broke their retirement funds 401k 's and ira 's destroyed and without any means of paying their mortgages thus the rise in people losing their homes   what has obama 's policy been the same as bush 's policy but he printed more tripled our money supply in 3 years and lowered interest rates even more effectively to 0   what so many people do n't seem to understand is that printing money effectively steals money from the middle class it 's a hidden tax on our savings accounts if more people realized this they 'd be outraged luckily for the government most people are mindless sheep willing to buy into the political propaganda being pushed by the media

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

probably the most important thing in evaluating a dividend yield is to compare it to itself in the past if the dividend yield is higher than it has been in the past the stock may be cheap if it is lower the stock may be expensive just about every stock has a normal yield for itself it 's zero for non dividend paying stocks this is based on the stock 's perceived quality growth potential and other factors so a utility that normally yields 5 and is now paying 3 is probably expensive the price in the denominator is too high while a growth stock that normally yields 2 and is now yielding 3 e.g. intel or may be cheap

i do n't think that there is a generic answer that will apply to this question across all goods   the answer depends on how the related businesses work how much insight you have into the true value of the goods and probably other things   your car example is a good one that shows multiple options there are dealers who will buy as a single transaction sell as a single transaction or do a simultaneous sell with trade in   i had a hot tub once on the other hand where i could find people who would do a trade in but there was no dealer who would just buy my used tub   there 's not much parallel between the car and the tub because the options available are very different to the extent that there is a generic answer i generally agree with the point in @keshlam 's answer about trying to avoid but i take a slightly different view   if you want to get your best deal you need to have an idea going into the process of what you want in net and keep focused on meeting your goal if for some reason it 's convenient for the dealer to move money around between the new car and the trade in i 'm ok with that as long as i 'm getting what i want out of the deal   if possible i prefer to deal with both transactions at once because it 's simpler   at the same time i 'm willing to remove the trade in from the deal if i 'm not getting what i want threatening to do so can also give you some information about where the dealer really puts the value between the new car and trade in since if you threaten to pull the trade in the price on the car will probably change in response

on the face this appears a sound method to manage long run cumulative interest but there are some caveats maxing out credit cards will destroy your credit rating   you will receive no more reasonable offers for credit only shady ones   though your credit rating will rise the moment you bring the balance back down to 10 even with high income it 's easy to the 8 months and then a high interest rate kicks in because of the low credit rating further maxing out credit cards will encourage credit card lenders to begin cutting limits and at worse demand early payment now after month 6 hits your financial payment obligations skyrocket   a sudden is never easy to manage   this will increase risk of missing a payment a disaster for such hair line financing in short the probability of your financial structure is high for very little benefit if you are confident that you can pay off $ 4,000 in 8 months then simply apply those payments to the student loan directly cutting out the middle man   your creditors will be pleased to see your total liabilities fall at a high rate while your utilization remains small encouraging them to offer you more credit and lower rates the ideal credit card utilization rate is 10 so it would be wise to use that portion to repay the student loans building up credit will allow you to use the credit as an auxiliary cushion when financial disaster strikes   keeping an excellent credit rating will allow you to finance the largest home possible for your money   every percentage point of mortgage interest can mean the difference between a million usd home and a $ 750,000 one

over a period of time greater than 10 years keep in mind 2000 2009 ten year period fails so i am talking longer the market as measured by the s&p 500 was positive long term averaging more than 10%/yr   at a 1 year horizon the success is 67 or so percent it 's mostly for this reason that those asking about investing are told that if they need money in a year or two to buy a house for instance they are told to stay out of the market   as the time approaches one day or less the success rate drops to 50/50 the next trade being higher or lower is a random event   say you have a $ 5 commission a $ 10,000 trade buy sell is $ 10 for the day 250 trading days costs you $ 2500 if you get in and out once per day you need to be ahead 25 for the year to break even   you can spin the numbers any way you wish but in the end time long time spans is on your side

let 's base teacher performance off of student value added growth scores   surely nothing bad will happen when we create incentivize teachers to make sure that student performance continuously rises    i mean campbell 's law is just a load of horseshit right   it 's not like these policies led to widespread test cheating in atlanta and washington dc and several other cities    in all seriousness look at what happened in washington dc   student performance was used as the metric by which the district out both the carrot and the stick the $ 160k paycheck or dismissal   103 schools out of 200 or so were found to have statistical indicators of cheating in some schools nearly 100 of tested classrooms were found to have wrong to right in statistically levels   this was n't found out until years after these test scores were used to evaluate a whole crop of teachers suppose you were the teacher whose children had previously been scored by cheating teachers or administrators   the model used to evaluate you expects that these children will see test score growth of x percent each year if you do n't cheat you will get fired   if you do cheat you become eligible to get a of money   all that aside the debate should n't even be about using student performance to evaluate teachers   the debate should n't be about who gets laid off   the debate should be about how we prevent teachers from getting laid off

the profit margin the most minimal as possible to gain customers over time   that 's not the right way to go the running for the lowest price is endless and no one is going to win   what you have to do is establish your brand and charge a fair price for something that add value on people 's life if they think it 's worth they will buy it that 's the best way to grow your ecommerce   shopify + is the easiest way to go first what you need to do is find what you want to sell then name your store and create a good logo for it remember you need to focus on establish your brand going for the lowest price not going to take you anywhere they will just buy from you because it 's cheap and sometimes not even that you are selling the service not only the product you ca n't charge too much but charge the lowest price is not good either   1- $ 300 i think it 's too much i would charge you half of that if you were my client it 's easy but time consuming to set up a shopify store depending on how many items you would be selling you need to be aware to banners logo and social media at very beginning too so it 's not only the store itself   2- if you are going for shopify you do n't need servers vps the shopify will be your hosting what you need would be mostly pay designer logo banners apps upsell shipping domain and maybe someone to write your product description   about how much would you get back it depends completely of what you are about to sell and how is the market for it i work with digital marketing and wanted to test my entrepreneurship skills with e commerce plus my marketing knowledge last week ended up making over $ 5,500 on the first 5 days selling in brazil proof   but if you do n't have any knowledge about it do n't expect too much at very beginning you probably wo n't sell anything or almost nothing on your first month based on some friends experiences   3- that 's true i spend around $ to get more than $ 5,500 in sales in 5 days they are mostly from facebook ads never tried any independent website and i do n't think that 's worth for a new e commerce in my opinion but again if you do n't have marketing knowledge you will spend a lot of money to make it worth for you here i highly recommend you to hire someone to do it for you or teach you that 's sometimes an expensive service but better than what you would spend trying to learn doing by yourself   let me know if i can help you with your website or anything else i have the knowledge but sometimes i do n't know how to express myself hope i helped you

you should plan on your monthly payment principal + interest + escrow being a conservative percentage of your take home pay    no matter your cash savings if your housing is 60 of your take home pay you are going to have trouble keeping up on the house my target for housing is that a 15 year fixed rate mortgage should be under 25 of my take home pay    for some people they find that too conservative   i think the exact percent is a risk reward preference   some people like the 25 number but look at a 30 year mortgage whatever you do do n't buy a house at the limit of what the bank thinks you can afford   historically they have been more willing for me to spend my money than i have been

if you 're living in a market where some houses are going for $ 150 k over asking then you must buy before you sell   in a seller 's market you will get multiple offers on your current house when you decide to sell it will sell for well over asking and you can dictate possession dates   you do not need to worry about selling your own home if you have a competent realtor but buying a home is an entirely different story   you may struggle to find something affordable and there may be multiple buyers each time you decide to make an offer   you may go through this cycle several times over many months before your offer   is accepted   you should do this while living in your own home with the comfort of knowing that you can sell your own home easily at any time instead of the stress of an imminent closing date on your own home   or worse move into rented space or 's mom 's house for months or a year while the market increases by 15 and the houses in your old area are now selling for $ 100 k more than you sold for   ouch now you really ca n't afford to buy what you want and you may end up buying something equivalent to what you used to own for more plus legal realtor and land transfer costs if the closing dates do n't align then bridge   this will only end up costing a few hundred dollars less than $ 1 k including legal fees the lawyer will also charge to handle this   but by buying before you sell you 'll easily make up that difference this advice only applies to hot property markets   i 'm not a realtor just a guy living in the who went through this process last year   lost out on three offers over 10 months then bought for asking price on fourth offer very fortunate then sold for $ 90 k over asking then for 2 months   my realtor is awesome and made the process as stress free as it can be    get a good realtor start house hunting while preparing your own house for sale and enjoy the process   also you should negotiate with your realtor they may be willing to reduce their commission on your sale if they are also representing you on the purchase good luck p.s. do not make a contingent offer and do not accept one   get your financing in place before you make an offer and if you are concerned about inspection you can also do that before the offer if you act quickly   the inspection will cost ~$500 but it will increase the value of your offer by much more than that since you will be going in without conditions   i spent on two property inspections on homes i lost out on and i do n't regret it   that is the cost of doing business the other offers on the home i eventually bought were for significantly more than my offer but they had conditions   i saved at least $ 40 k by being condition free and i only spent $ 1,500 on three property inspections   and some people will just drop out of the multiple offer scenario when they learn that one of the buyers has done an inspection

401(k withdrawals early or otherwise are not subject to fica or medicare taxes   that 's because they already were taxed when they were contributed   and of course the earnings from the 401(k contributions are not earned income and thus are not subject to payroll taxes for that reason while 401(k contributions are exempt from federal and generally state income taxes they are n't exempt from payroll taxes and as such you 'll see two separate amounts on your w2 and paystub if you contributed the amount that is subject to those taxes and the amount that is subject to income tax so no you do n't have to pay payroll fica social security taxes on your early withdrawal   as for the penalty that is basically an extra tax so if you withdraw $ 1000 you pay income tax at your marginal rate plus 10 penalty if your marginal rate is 25 and you 're not moving across a rate step boundary you will pay +

you 're certainly still responsible to pay what you owe the company given that 1 for whatever reason the recipient never received the checks and 2 the money was credited back to you albeit in a less than timely manner however if you take the time to explain the situation to the business and show them proof that you sent the payments i would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan also if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened this is really a perfect example though of why balancing your checking account is as important today as it ever was

it seems like you are asking two different questions one is how do i know if i can afford a house the other is how do i know what type of mortage to get the first question is fairly simple to answer there 's plenty of calculators out there that will tell you what you can afford but rule of thumb is 30 of income can goto housing now what type of mortgage to get can be much more confusing because the mortgage industry makes money off of these confusing products the best thing to do in my in situations like this is to keep it simple you need to be careful buying a house so much money is changing hands and there are so many parasites involved in the transaction i would be extremely wary of anybody who is going to tell you what mortgage to get i 've never heard of a fee only independent mortgage broker and if i found one that claimed to be i would n't believe him i would just ignore all the exotic non conforming products and just answer one simple question are you the type of person that buys an insurance policy or that likes to self insure if you like insurance get a 30 year fixed mortgage if you like to self insure get a 7 year arm the average someone owns a house is 7 years plus in 7 years time it might not adjust up and even if it does you can just accelerate your payments and pay it off quickly this is the self insurance part of it if you 're like me i 'm willing to pay an extra .5 for the 30 year so that my payment never changes and i 'm never forced to move which is extremely unlikely but i like the safety i do n't like 15 year term loans because rates are so low you can get way better returns in the stock market right now so why pay off sooner then you need to heck if i had a paid off house right now i 'd refi into a 30 year and invest the money in summary pick 30 year or arm then just shop around to find the lowest rate which is extremely easy

it would appear that you are not actually equal partners   you have differently valued interests and those values fluctuate based on individual performance   the turbotax advice is simplified for entities that do n't track interests relative to partner inputs irc partner 's share is set by the partnership agreement and failing an allocation by the agreement it is set by the partner 's interest in the partnership   but note which prevents blatant tax rigging in the partnership agreement

at its simplest level it 's an application of basic statistics probability suppose you have n independent and identically distributed assets with the return on asset i which has mean m and variance same for all assets you can easily weaken these assumptions but i make them to simplify the   square brackets show a numerical example with if you invest in one of these assets you expect to get a return of m 8 with standard deviation s 2 so you expect with probability 95 approx to get a return between and   between 4 and 12 now suppose you split your money equally among the n assets   your return is now r = your expected return is   = = m = m    8 the variance of your return is   = var        = = n =     so the standard deviation is = = s = now with 95 probability we get a return between and between and   this interval is smaller than when we invested in the single asset so in effect with this portfolio we are achieving the same return m 8 but with lower variance risk instead of 2   this is the result of diversification      you can assume the assets are not independent and most book of this topic do indeed do that in that case the calculation is modified because the variance of the portfolio now depends on the correlation between returns as does the reduction in variance caused by the diversification   if assets are negatively correlated the result of the diversification will be more reduction in risk and vice versa    you can also assume the assets are not identically distributed and the above analysis does not change too much    you might look for some references on capm capital asset pricing model or portfolio theory but broadly these are based on what i have described above finding the portfolio with minimum variance for a given return by investing proportionally in treasury bonds and risky assets

yeah the owner and inventor ted does final editing of all of the pages and he puts it out pretty much the way he speaks it 's not sketchy in any way he 's been working on it for about 8 years has fda approval in the works for each product and is filing 14 new patents within the next year as for the title i was just highlighting one of the products that i personally think will do well the website will be getting a redesign once it 's in full production for the moment he has just the nuts and bolts until he has financial backing to make sure he can produce for the expected demand

lets say debit is what you pay and credit is what somebody else pays for you a debit card will charge your bank account directly a credit card will charge your bank account some time later in both cases the shop owner has the money available directly it 's called credit because somebody believes you will be able to pay your debt on time or later with an interest as for purchase and sales a customer buys = makes a purchase a sells = makes a sale note from a bar i made an agreement with the bank they do n't sell beer i do n't give credit

the attempts to link asset prices equity risk premiums to the substitution of consumption instead of the normal beta so essentially what it 's trying to say is you prefer to smooth consumption you hate volatile consumption patterns therefore you demand higher returns in booms and will settle for lower returns in downturns it may sound counter intuitive at first but think in terms of marginal utilities in booms your marginal utility is lower as you 're already well off therefore you demand more of an asset    the tries to link asset prices to real economic theory consumption whereas capm is derived from the assumption that investors only care about mean and variance of returns no real link to the real side of the economy    there are almost no real world applications for the empirically it is almost a complete failure complex extensions have only gotten it so far see the equity premium puzzle by and 1985

you 're assuming here that anything that is difficult to obtain will be highly desired   for me value is largely determined by the buyer even if it takes the same effort to get 20 bushels of apples and a nugget of gold if the majority of people find a nugget of gold to be worth 100 bushels that will be the value of gold    conversely lets say there is an element buried deep in the earth that has no use whatsoever even if it takes the effort of 10 nuggets of gold because nobody has any use for it its value will be zero even though there is high effort to procure   i hope that clarifies your question of the exchange rate it is determined by how much each party values the goods involved

the exact financial followed is different for different regions countires the difference is more historical and a practise that has no advantage reason to change many countries like us japan the financial year can be by companies and needs to be same every year this need not be same as the financial year followed by government typically banks would follow the financial year followed by government as this would have more direct impact on the business per say in terms of policy changes which are typically from the of new financial year for government if the banks follow a different there would be additional overhead of transactions for reporting large corporates on other hand would tend to follow a year as it is more when operating in different   there is a very good article on wikipedia

gt plus they get to be the wal mart of the internet and all of their competitor   it 's all about market amazon accounting corporate profits rich peoples income invisible not the appearance of investment   they turn most of their profits into dividends so they get taxed from investors once at a 20 rate rather than a 35 then 20 48 total   they are basically exploiting a glitch where dividend payments are tax deductible to the company rather than rightfully being considered profits being collected by the owners
# 516817
yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i have n't seen the movie so i wo n't try to put anything in story context   sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice    in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have   or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those this is called a naked short   in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract   with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price   you could own an orange and plan to turn your oranges into juice   or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice   or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what they 're doing here    in general people make profits by buying low and selling high   in this case they did so in reverse order   they took the risk of selling before they had a supply   then they covered their position by purchasing the supply   they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold    the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit   so they sell orange juice on the futures market   then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market   and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them    without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves   this way they can share risks with each other and financiers   combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances   without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices

you will likely have an options pricing course in your degree program   if option pricing is not part of the curriculum at all i would transfer out   i 've had a few co workers and interviewed candidates who graduated from satellite campuses of major schools   it 's surprising how many of them somehow made it through a finance degree program never learning about options and other derivatives   the guys that never learned them end up having to play catch up on the job   a good portion of them end up figuring it out but a group of them also end up being let go or they leave because they just ca n't figure it out    options are a key and important part of finance make sure you understand them   they also are n't that hard to figure out
# 19179
yeah i guess the entire report is probably false because of that what you 're saying is applicable to the renewable industry too there 's all kinds of other investments made on behalf of renewables that are n't calculated into dollar amounts most obviously is the money that never even hits the books by subsidizing through consumer corporate tax breaks   for example the company you work for more than likely has a recycling program it does n't make money because it 's not profitable to recycle anything but aluminum but if they did n't have the program they would get penalized not directly necessarily but would lose out on green initiative funding    the rest of what you are saying is as intangible as the first thing if you think solar panels on your roof is going to keep the military out of other countries you 're clinical and if you ca n't notice a correlation between the total lack of production coupled with the massive amounts of money being wasted then there 's no discussion to be had    by the by that article has no citations and the link to any additional sourcing is broken

in canada there are many stores that take debit interac but do n't take visa or mastercard for example a corner store in the us the reverse is often true every tiny place seems to take visa or mastercard but not debit a visa debit card looks like a visa card to the merchant it therefore has the benefit of being usable at places that only take visa substitute mastercard as necessary this benefit is very small in canada less so elsewhere meanwhile the money is actually coming out of your bank account just like a debit card which therefore has the benefit that you 're not borrowing money ca n't accidentally overspend and run no risk of incurring interest charges it is also a way to get what appears to be a credit card when you ca n't qualify for credit if you do the majority of your spending in canada you do n't need a visa or mastercard debit card your regular debit card interac will work fine for you if you have a credit card anyway from another bank or whatever then again you do n't need a debit card that can pretend to be a credit card

i use amazon all the time but they are hardly a monopoly i buy from other sites as much or more than i do amazon it 's big and has great customer service but not always the best prices they are far from being a monopoly and the chances of that happening are super simple they 'd have to run every single online store out of business and that 's impossible

you mean offshoring i heard this in the presidential debate also every source i could find said that companies would get about 3/4 of the expense of offshoring written off meaning if it would cost me 100 dollars to move a factory to china after i payed taxes it would only cost me 25 dollars   i was not 100 percent on the of these sources so i would recommend doing your own research
