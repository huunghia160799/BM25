not directly but companies benefit in various ways from a higher stock price one way a high stock price can hurt a company is that many companies do share buybacks when the price is too high economically speaking a company should only buy back shares when those shares are undervalued but management may have incentives to do buybacks at irrationally high prices

when a stock price rises the company 's assets are worth more this does n't mean it gets more cash directly but it can liquidate (= sell some of its stocks for a higher return than before

seems like no one in this thread has heard of treasury stocks which indeed allow a company to own and sell its own stock think about it when there is a stock buy back funded by excess profits where does that stock go
# 137478
no not directly a company issues stock in order to raise capital for building its business once the initial shares are sold to the public the company does n't receive additional funds from future transactions of those shares of stock between the public   however the company could issue more shares at the new higher price to raise more capital

hey just letting you know that i 've sort of felt the same as you before i 'm not 29 yet only a few years younger and i too am in alberta knowing that many trades can be quite lucrative here i too dipped my hand in them namely the hvac and plumbing trades and after a bit i felt that they were n't for me and this was after using a year looking for any ins during the recession since nobody was hiring first years during that whole year in the times i was n't looking for a job i was researching and looking up videos of the trades and was thinking how after some career counseling soul searching all that jazz i 'm about to head back to school next week if things go well by the time i graduate i will almost be 30 with my first and probably only degree     i would n't consider the years from the time i graduated high school to today where i think i 've figured out what i want to do a waste but instead i look at them as years where i grew as an adult and gaining real world experience in a few areas i 've in a future employer may look at them as wasted years but it is up to me to spin them in a positive way as my story just know that you are n't alone in this situation and i 'm sure there 's plenty of people worldwide in their 20 's and 30 's who are still trying to figure out what they want to do keep your head up and good luck

the biggest issue with a pure physical dividend is the cost of transfer cash or stock dividends are decentralized and easy to transfer ownership hence the majority of value can be transferred to the shareholder    if you were to deliver wine to every shareholder you would have to deduct the cost of transport from the value of the wine dividend otherwise it becomes value to shareholders and they 'd be better off keeping the dividend as stock value

i know this wo n't be a popular answer but here goes bitcoin regardless of how you feel about the long term prospects of bitcoin it actually works very well as a way to transfer money with hardly any fee you can go online buy bitcoin transfer them for a very tiny fee then the person on the other end can cash out in their own local currency in fact bitcoin is gaining a lot of popularity in some countries for this very reason it is becoming more common for one family member to come to america or to work then use bitcoin to transfer money to their family back home this works so well because even international transfers have such low fees the best place to get bitcoins will vary depending on where you live i 'm american so i use coinbase i believe is popular in europe i 'm not sure about other countries

it does n't really make sense to worry about the details of what counts as saving unless you also move beyond a simplistic rule of thumb like save 10 of your income that said most of the sources i see pushing rules of thumb like that are talking about saving for retirement   that is you need to sock that money away so you will be able to spend it after you retire   this cnn page is one example   on that theory it only counts if you put it away and do n't touch it until you retire so things like car and computer funds would not count as saving another thing you 'll see some people say e.g. this nerdwallet article is to use 20 of your income for financial priorities   this would include retirement saving but also things like paying off debt and saving for a down payment on a house saving for a small purchase in the near future would not usually be considered saving at all since you 're not going to keep the money   if you put $ 5 in your wallet tonight so you can buy a hamburger for lunch tomorrow you would n't call that saving likewise setting aside a few hundred dollars for a new computer would n't count as saving under most definitions   some people might count saving for something like a house since that is a long term plan and the house unlike a computer may rise in value after you buy it   but you would n't want to fully count the house as part of your retirement savings unless you 're willing to sell it and live off the proceeds however none of these rules will help that much if your goal is as you say at the end of your question to know if i need to save more than what i actually am saving currently   saving 10 of your income wo n't magically ensure that you 're saving enough   to assess whether you personally are saving enough you need to actually start running some numbers on how much money you personally will need in retirement   this will depend on any number of factors including where you live what sources of retirement income you might have besides savings e.g. pensions etc   in short to know if you 're saving enough you ca n't listen to the generic stuff that everyone says you need to consider your own situation in a deliberate focused way

i can see why you are feeling financial stress   if i understand right you have put yourself in a very uncomfortable and unsustainable situation and one that should indeed be very stressful for a person of your age   i feel a lot of stress just reading over your question i 'm going to be very frank   your financial situation suggests that you have very aggressively taken wealth from your future self in order to consume and to make inefficient investments   well look in the mirror and say to yourself i am now my future self and it is time to pay for my past decisions   do n't take money out of your ira   that would be continuing the behavior as it is a very inefficient use of your resources that will lead to yet more extreme poverty down the line ok you ca n't take back what you have done in the past   what to do now   major life restructuring   if i were you i 'd sell my house if i had one   move in with one of your kids if you have any nearby   if not move into the cheapest trailer you can find   take a second job   very seriously look to see if you can get a job that pays more for your primary job i know you love your current job but you simply can not continue as you are now   start eating really cheap food and buying clothes at thrift stores   throw everything you can at your debts starting with the ones with the highest interest rate   plan now to continue working long after your peers have retired early in life is the time to be borrowing   middle age is when you should be finishing paying off any remaining debts and away like crazy for retirement   now is not an ok time to be taking on additional debt to fund consumption i know changing your life is going to be very uncomfortable but i think you will find that there is more peace of mind in having some amount of financial security which for you will require a lot of changes than in borrowing ever more to fund a lifestyle you can not sustain

lets make some assumptions you are not close to retirement   you have no other debts   you have a job   you have no big need for the money    you should invest that   do not invest with a bank they are not as competitive on fees as a brokerage account you can get specific answers that are different from every person so you should dig in and research a lot more if you care and you should   personally i would suggest you open an account with one of the low cost providers then with that new investment account put your money into a target retirement account   file your statements away and tend to it once a year   make sure it is there that you can access it that nothing alarming is going on   you certainly have enough to start an investment account   if you want to get more into it ask a phone adviser what you should open finally before you start investing make sure you follow the advice of and have no debt saving the most you can for retirement a rule of thumb is your money will double every 72 months congratulations you are a saver   investing is n't for you as the risk of investing is in conflict with your desire to you money open a savings account or high interest checking account with a credit union online only or local community bank   shop around no the web for the highest interest   do n't get your hopes up though the highest rate you see that does n't have strings attached wo n't be much here late summer of 2012

while i 've never used wall street survivor i took a look over the marketing materials and i 've seen multiple similar contests run among investment interns also just out of college   i see some good here and some bad first off i love interactive web based tutorials   i 've used one to learn the syntax of a new programming language and i find the instant feedback and the ability to work at your own pace very useful   the reviews seem to say that wall street survivor is a good way to learn the basics of how trading stocks works and the lingo   also it seems pretty fun which i 've found helps a lot wall street survivor will hopefully teach you that there are many real stock markets and that they may have somewhat different prices and they likely take the real and timely data from a single market wall street survivor also me   the big problem that i see with interns running similar contests is that the market is extremely random over short to medium periods of time   an intern can make an awful portfolio or even pick stocks at random and still win the contest   these interns know a lot about the randomness in markets already so they do n't believe they are trading geniuses because they won a contest i 'm not sure there is much to temper this view on this web site also while wall street survivor teaches you about trading it does n't appear to teach you about investing   the website appears to encourage short term views and changing positions a lot and does n't seem to simulate the full trading costs including fees that would eat away at the gains of a individual investor that trades that much   it gives some help with longer term thinking like diversification but also seems to encourage trading that makes wall street survivor more money but are likely detrimental to the user i would say have fun with wall street survivor let it teach you some things about trading but do n't give the site much if any money   at the same time pick up a copy of short book called a random walk down wall street and start learning about investing at the same time   feel free to come back to stack exchange with questions along the way

the economy stinks because the government targets a straight line rate of ngdp growth that is ever diverging from the rate of sustainable economic growth which has been flattening since the 1970s when the cost of energy sustained significant rises in price and never looked back the only way to make the economy not stink is to find a miraculously cheap energy source that is as cheap as fossil fuels were before the 1970s   since the possibility of this is practically zero the best we can do is make the economy stink less in the long run by intentionally flattening the rate of ngdp growth by gradually pulling back on massive debt spending and tightening loose monetary policies if we do n't do this we are just setting ourselves up for a future economic correction whose will not only be bigger than the great recession but will also be relatively bigger than the great depression

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

most individuals do not need a personal financial advisor if you are soon entering the world of work your discretionary investments should be focused on index funds that you commit to over the long run indeed the best advice i would give to anyone just starting out would be for most average young workers a financial advisor will just give you some version of the information above but will change you for it i would not recommend a financial advisor as a necessity until you have seriously complicated taxes your taxes will not be complicated save your money

a loan is not a taxable income neither is a gift loans are repaid with interest the interest is taxable income to the lender and may or may not be deductible to the borrower depending on how the loan proceeds were used gifts are taxable to the donor the person giving the gift under the gift tax they 're not a taxable income to the recipient some gifts are exempt or excluded from gift tax there 's the annual exemption limit lifetime exclusion which is correlated to the estate tax various specific purpose gifts or transfers between spouses are exempt in general   if you trade for something of equal value is that considered income yes sale proceeds are taxable income however your basis in the item sold is deductible from it if you borrow a small amount of money for a short time is that considered income see above loan proceeds are not income does the friend have to pay taxes when they get back their $ 10 no repayment of the loan is not taxable income interest on it is do you have to pay taxes if you are paid back in a different format than originally paid form of payment does n't matter barter trade does n't affect the tax liability the friend sold you lunches and you paid for them the friend can deduct the cost of the lunches from the proceeds what 's left is taxable income everything is translated to the functional currency at the fair market value at the time of the trade you are required to pay taxes on the gross amount very rarely taxes apply to gross income definitely not the us federal income taxes for individuals an example of an exception would be the california llc taxes the state of california taxes llcs under its jurisdiction on gross proceeds regardless of the actual net income this is very uncommon however the irc the us federal tax code is basically everything is taxable except what 's not and the cost of generating income is one of the what 's not that is why you can deduct the basis of the asset from your gross proceeds when you sell stuff and only pay taxes on the net difference

one reason to not do that is if you consider that one of the loans is at risk of being called in early    e.g. you have a line of credit which is close to its limit and the bank decides to reduce that limit forcing you to quickly come up with the money to pay it down below the new limit which can really throw a wrench into your plans

the bid price is simply the highest buy price currently being offered and the ask price simply the lowest sell price being offered the list of bid and ask prices is called the market depth when the bid and ask prices match then a sale goes through when looking to sell you would generally look at both the bid and ask prices as a seller you want to be matched with the bid price to get a sale but you also need to check the current list of ask prices if the price you want to sell at is too high you will be placed down the ask price list and unless the price moves up to match your sell price you will not end up selling on the other hand if your price to sell is too low and in fact much lower than the current lowest sell price you may get a quick sale but maybe at a lower price than you could have gotten similarly when looking to buy you would generally also look at both the bid and ask prices as a buyer you want to be matched with the ask price to get a sale but you also need to check the current list of bid prices if the price you want to buy at is too low you will be placed down the bid price list and unless the price moves down to match your buy price you will no end up buying on the other hand if your price to buy is too high and in fact much higher than the current highest buy price you may get a quick purchase but maybe at a higher price than you could have gotten so whether buying or selling it is important to look at and consider both the bid and ask prices in the market depth

bitcoin prices are likely rising as a result of the simple issue of supply and demand   supply is constrained as there are n't much in the way of new bitcoins coming into existence and demand is high right now as a result of various events for example this reuters article goes into some detail as to some current influences   mostly crypto hedge funds are buying a lot of bitcoins as a speculative move i.e. believing the price will continue to rise    the evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange but are speculating to increase their capital many describe the bubble as similar to the tulip craze in century from the same reuters article it â€™s got all the of your tulip bubble chart but that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it standard life â€™s head of investment strategy andrew said on wednesday who is to say it does nâ€™t reach $ 100,000 you can see in the volume chart from that the trading volume for bitcoins has really increased and if you look at the market price you see a very similar movement however if you look at the number of transactions per day that number is basically constant meaning the actual uses of bitcoins by people just buying or selling goods or services is n't really changing much but the dollar amount is   that 's indicative of a speculation caused bubble below is a graph i made from the data from above that price with trading volume you can see clearly the increase in volume and increase in price are nearly simultaneous   bitcoin itself has some actual utility mostly for black market sellers and similar people participating in activities that are less than legal not ethically bad for example people in nations with oppressive regimes that limit contact with the outside world or try to restrict foreign currency purchases   it 's unlikely that the degree of adoption so far however has driven it to this level and the fact that bitcoin can be broken up into very small chunks means that the big boom in price of individual bitcoins causes the demand side pressure from the actual use of bitcoins to be as there is now 1/10th the demand for bitcoins from people who use them for non speculative reasons

i would like to offer a different perspective here   the standard fee for a credit card transaction is typically on the order of 30 cents + 2.5 of the amount the actual numbers vary but this is the ballpark this makes small charges frequently unprofitable for small merchants because of this they will often have minimum purchase requirements for credit debit card payments the situation changes for large retailers think wal mart target safeway home depot i can not find a citation for this right now but large retailers are able to negotiate volume discounts from credit card companies a guy who used to work in finance at home depot told me this once their transaction fees are much lower than 30 cents + 2.5 but you get the same reward points on your credit card debit card regardless of where you swipe it so my personal philosophy is large chain swipe away without guilt for any amount small merchant use cash unless it 's hundreds of dollars and then they may give you a cash discount in that case and make sure to carry enough cash for such situations when i was a student that was about $ 20 enough for coffee or lunch at a small place

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

it sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well which is why it may seem like it does n't matter   fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends   one way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described   but multiples are inherently backward looking so for firms with good growth prospects they can be very poor estimates of future profitability when you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities   that 's all it could be that the market is overestimating that growth but you would need more information in order to conclude that   we call warren buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios   that may be in many cases but it does n't necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices   it 's just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described

they all basically mean the same thing a type of debt than can be exchanged for converted into equity at some point it 's only the mechanics that can be different a convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond it usually pays periodic interest and has a face value that 's due at maturity the difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond   there can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond can be converted into   if the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond it 's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert a convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that 's redeemed but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round   rather than specifying a specific number of shares the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market so they both are debt instruments that can turn into equity investments just through different mechanisms a debenture is a fancy word for unsecured debt and convertible debt could be used to described either structure above so those terms could mean either type of structure

there is not one right way it depends on the level of detail that you need one way would be create the following accounts when you pay the phone bill when you are paid with the reimbursement that is when you pay the phone bill you must debit both phone expense to record the expense and also reimbursements due to record the fact that someone now owes you money if it 's useful you could add another layer of complexity when you receive the bill you have a liability and when you pay it you discharge that liability whether that 's worth keeping track of depends i never do for month to month bills afterthought i see another poster says that your method is incorrect because a reimbursement is not salary technically true though that problem could be fixed by the account to something like income from employer the more serious problem i see is that you are reversing the phone expense when you are reimbursed so at the end of the year you will show total phone expense as $ 0 this is clearly not correct you did have phone expenses they were just reimbursed you really are treating the expense account as an asset account phone expenses due to be reimbursed by employer

in the united states if someone refers to the interest rate especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate a rate set forth and maintained by the united states federal reserve the fed for short if the fed opts to raise or lower this rate it subsequently effects all interest rates whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans   or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions the fomc meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate   the federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates it is the rate most commonly referred to as interest rate when used alone that is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g. mortgage rates 10 year 30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate auto rate credit card rate cd rate all rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate   this is true in the united states but will vary for other countries in general though it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country institution etc   note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is in turn based on the federal funds rate it is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand and thus the yields are correlated to the federal funds rate

it is a good idea to keep the receipts the reason being that the from the atm and the debit to the account are process there are multiple during this process between the hardware of the atm the software controlling the atm and the core banking software like any software programming there are chances of errors ie amounts being debit wrong due to bugs or duplicate of transactions being posted such errors would normally get caught during recon between the atm software and the core banking postings its advisable to keep the receipts and verify erroneous debits in such cases the receipts would provide additional information required by the bank to rectify the errors promptly

yeah exactly the difference is that ferrari is making money   edit to clarify   ferrari sells a niche product to a boutique customer base willing to pay a premium in terms of both price and purchasing difficulty for exclusive super premium cars that are manufactured to standards with little or no regard for cost efficiency or price to value ratio etc people buying ferrari are not looking for a sensible deal they are people who can afford to pay for something special rare and tesla is in a similar market position    ferrari actually makes money selling their cars they do a low volume boutique business and charge prices that reflect a low volume of made specialty product i am sure that certain special order customers have to wait some time for delivery but i drive by a ferrari dealership every day on my way to work that has maybe 50 sitting in a lot that you can drive off with same day if you want you can literally drive up test drive and buy one tomorrow if you have the scratch    otoh   teslas are cheaper than but they are still deep into the super premium price category they are well outside the value proposition customer base they are also perhaps even more than ferrari in a market segment without meaningful competition there are several super premium in the $ 100 200k price range but i suspect most tesla shoppers are not mostly comparing them against or or the all electric market is not a highly competitive one    there is massive demand for teslas as is evidenced by the extremely thin used market the year plus long wait list and all that in the face of extremely customer unfriendly sales distribution and almost zero marketing that is people are waiting up in 18-month long lines to buy cars that they ca n't inspect at a local dealership have no way to test drive and often have never even seen in person and they are putting down cash deposits to do so in amounts that could buy some pretty nice sports cars for the deposit alone moreover it 's not like tesla buyers are going to change their minds and get a chevy volt or honda insight instead although they might get both    this is any startups wet dream   you have a product that is not only already in production but that you have been shipping for several you know the tooling manufacturing support and delivery costs because you have actually been doing it for years   you not only have no issues whatsoever with regards to building a customer base you already have paying customers and genuine orders already booked through 2014 more than you can keep up with   you have a product with massive demand and almost non existent price pressure you 've got orders booked over a year out at asking price with virtually zero marketing or advertising most customers buying site unseen purely based on concept and reputation and your customers are paying super premium prices with no direct competitor alternative    this is a this is the kind of thing that business school textbooks tell you never happens rational market theory says it 's impossible to have a big ticket product offering with essentially unlimited demand and zero meaningful competition    moreover this is happening in an environment where the business is not only receiving direct gov't subsidies but where borrowing costs are close to negative in real dollars a going concern with booked orders and guaranteed revenue through 2014 should if anything be borrowing from banks to buy back equity not selling equity to raise capital    if tesla needs to raise capital then something is seriously wrong with the underlying business as in wrong enough that its current sales are not only un profitable but that currently booked future sales will continue to be un profitable for the foreseeable future otherwise they could just borrow    you can plead startup when you have a small customer base but a great concept you can plead startup when you first start shipping product in small quantities at low prices but you ca n't plead startup when you have been shipping a product for years and when you have customer orders booked years out at full asking price with no meaningful price or product competition

i 'm also a uk ltd company contractor that has the same topic i afraid however that i do n't understand the maths in the original question mortgage interest is flat for the term of the mortgage rather than compounded so ignoring the at the end of the lifespan of the mortgage i get the amount of interest to something like Â£ 7500 x 0.05 x 25 does this make the decision any easier for you as you point out the total cost of this overpayment from your company account is Â£ 12,500 using the above figure it would take over 13 years to recoup the Â£ 5,000 difference at Â£ 375 interest a year   i used to be of the same opinion that the mortgage should be paid off at all costs first but now i 'm coming round to the american way of thinking Â£ 12,500 invested in a pension with a 5 yield will easily outstrip the interest saved by making the over payment x 1.05 ^ 25 = Â£ over 250 better off Â£ Â£ + Â£ 7,500 i now make no mortgage overpayments at all and instead pay all the money into my pension this amongst other things keeps me below the upper earnings tax threshold so i 'm only paying corporation tax for the money i 'm drawing as dividends there 's a massive caveat to this though i 'm 49 i should be able to draw the tax free element of my pension pot in six years time and pay my mortgage off and it 's quite unlikely that the government will be changing pensions policy in that time but drawing 25 tax free has been a feature of pensions for quite some time i can then chose to keep working or retire if my pension is still doing well 9 ish pa at the moment i could chose to not pay my mortgage off at all in the next twenty or so years however all this could change in your position i would do a bit of both make a regular overpayment to pay down your mortgage even a small amount that you 'll barely notice will make quite a difference to the end date of your mortgage Â£ 100 a month will take years off i did n't start paying properly into my pension until fairly recently and so if you 're not already i 'd also make quite substantial regular payments into one now directly from your company 15 17.5 of your gross drawings leaving it until later will only make it more painful then when you get to retirement age no matter what you 'll have a decent pension pot an actuary i worked with pointed out that if you pay something into a pension when you retire you should have some sort of pot if you pay nothing you are absolutely guaranteed to have nothing and finally if you have n't already fix your mortgage we 're three years into a five year fix the variable rate we were going to be transferred to was we fixed not because of wanting any sense of security but because the fixed rate was with no fee there are much better rates than that about now rates are starting to rise so it 's a good time

what you are suggesting would be the correct strategy if you knew exactly when the market was going to go back up this is called market timing   since it has been shown that no one can do this consistently the best strategy is to just keep your money where it is   the market tends to make large jumps especially lately   missing just a few of these in a year can greatly impact your returns   it does n't really matter what the market does while you hold investments   the important part is how much you bought for and how much you sold for   this assumes that the reasons that you selected those particular investments are still valid   if this is not the case by all means sell them and pick something that does meet your needs

you probably want to think about pools of money separately if they have separate time horizons or are otherwise not interchangeable a classic example is your emergency fund which has a potentially immediate time horizon vs. your retirement savings the emergency fund would be all in cash or very short term bonds and would not count in your retirement asset allocation since the emergency fund usually has a capped value a certain amount of money you want to have for emergencies rather than a percentage of net worth value this especially makes sense you have to treat the emergency fund separately or you 'd have to keep changing your asset allocation percentages as your net worth rises hopefully with respect to the capped emergency amount similarly say you are saving for a car in 3 years you 'd probably invest that money very conservatively also it could not go in tax deferred retirement accounts and when you buy the car the account will go to zero so probably worth treating this separately on the other hand say you have some savings in tax deferred retirement accounts and some in taxable accounts but in both cases you 're expecting to use the money for retirement in that case you have the same time horizon and goals and it can pay to think about the taxable and nontaxable accounts as a whole in particular you can use asset location put less tax efficient assets in tax deferred accounts in this case maybe you would end up with mostly bonds in the tax deferred accounts and mostly equities in the taxable accounts for tax reasons the asset allocation would only make sense considering all the accounts since the taxable account would be too equity heavy and the tax deferred one too bond heavy there can be practical reasons to treat each account separately too though for example if your broker has a convenient automatic rebalancing tool on their website it probably only works within an account treating each account by itself would let you use the automatic rebalancing feature on the website while a more complicated asset location strategy where you rebalance across multiple accounts might be too hard and in practice you would n't get around to it getting around to rebalancing could be more important than tax motivated asset location you could also take a keep it simple attitude as long as your asset allocation is pretty balanced say 40 bonds and includes a cash allocation that would cover emergencies you could just put all your money in one big portfolio and think of it as a whole if you have an emergency withdraw from the cash allocation and then rebuild it over time if you have a major purchase you could redeem some bonds and then rebuild the bond portion over time when i say over time i 'm thinking you might start putting new contributions into the now assets or you might dollar cost average back into them by selling bits of the now assets anyway there 's no absolute rule it depends on what 's simple enough to be manageable for you in practice and what separate shorter horizon investing goals you have in addition to retirement you can always make things complex but remember that a simple plan that happens in real life is better than a complex plan you do n't keep up with in practice or a complex plan that takes away from activities you 'd enjoy more

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars because people renting these cars often them many of those are also written by unqualified individuals for publication on blog farms and encourage all sorts of financial practices that 's not even considering the interests of who is paying to advertise on said i 'm sure their interests align with making sure you always pay top dollar for a new car because those used ones are so mistreated never trust financial advice published on the internet or in the media for that matter edit one caveat on further never never buy used vehicles from government auctions asset old police cars etc anybody irresponsible enough to go to jail or abandon their car long enough to lose their assets likely is n't a responsible owner of such and cops and crooks alike do absolutely beat the out of police cars   when it comes to government owned vehicles police cars municipal governments are notoriously stingy and will squeeze every last minute of use out of them before putting them on the market if you 're buying a government vehicle assume it 's being sold because it has problems but from a financial point of view i notice that rental agencies sell cars within the first two years during the time when they depreciate the most bingo i figure many large rental companies will have mathematicians who calculate the best time to sell does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser it does n't take a phd to realize it 's bad for business if your model revolves around renting out 1970s that run the risk of breaking down and leaving customers stranded in inopportune or dangerous places in particular has a terrible reputation for this and it shows in the condition of their of the 90s all of them uber wo n't let you drive for them if your car is older than 7 10 years for the same reasons yes as a car ages the chance of having to make repairs increases rental agencies are in the business of renting vehicles not running service centers and garages it 's more aligned with their core business model to just dispose of cars once they 've squeezed the most reliable years out of them and amortize the vehicles depreciation across the tax deductions and fleet pricing they enjoy when buying new ones   this gets them out of the service game and lets them focus on their core procurement and rental there 's no calculated time to lemon that they 're trying to skirt here they 're just trying to avoid having to make any repairs whatsoever

somehow i just stumbled onto this thread   gt you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off    depends on leverage with fractional reserve lending   banks are permitted to loan out 30x their actual assets or more   if i have $ 1 but can loan out $ 30 and anything more than $ 1 gets paid back i have n't lost any money   in addition i can write off the amount defaulted and the government will pay me back for certain types of loans   with student loans since they are almost impossible to discharge gov't will pursue the borrower for years and decades and ultimately collect more interest   here is an article on it     gt according to the government stands to earn $ more in interest from a $ 10,000 loan that defaulted than if it had been paid in full over a 20-year term and $ more than if it had been paid back in 10 years alan founder of borrowers rights advocacy student loan justice said the high recovery rates provide a perverted incentive for the government to allow loans to go into default estimates the recovery rate would need to fall to below 50 in order for default prevention efforts to become more lucrative than defaults themselves    not to mention     gt so essentially the department is given a choice   either do nothing and get nothing or outlay cash with the knowledge that this outlay will realize a 22 percent return ultimately minus the governments cost of money and collection costs   from this perspective it is clear that based solely on financial motivations and without specific detailed knowledge of the loan i.e. borrower characteristics etc the would clearly favor the default scenario   for not only the   return but perhaps the potential savings in subsidy payment as well      and do n't forget the penalties accruing to the person defaulting they will probably have to move out of the country in order to escape collection   and let 's factor in the huge roi the lender sees by creating an indentured servant class   plus the gov't will issue as much currency as it wants to make itself whole   and how much of a loss is the loss when the whole of the loan amount went right back into the local economy paying professors janitors landlords grocery stores etc   and do n't forget all those taxes income and sale that the gov't collects   government will collect of the loan immediately as income and sales tax plus a portion of it every time the money changes hands i pay income tax then use some of my after tax money to pay you for a product or service and you still have to pay tax on that money and so on   so it 's more complicated than having robbed the person holding the debt   banks at 30x leverage do n't lose money as long as they get back of the total amount lent out including interest fees and penalties before considering write offs and government repayment   in fact the point of over leverage is so you can make loans that have risk attached   if you could only lend what you actually had you would have to stay away from anything risky because it would be too easy to lose money   having virtual $ to bet means you can serve market segments that have higher risk   this makes more money for the banks that 's why they do it   they are already playing with funny money so they do n't lose any even if you default and move to another country   and the money you spent has also made its way back to them in various amounts such as your professor 's mortgage payments auto loan etc   your taking on debt already helped the bank get its other loans repaid   so roughly speaking if you took out $ 90,000 and $ 3,000 of that made its way back to the bank through various means they have n't lost any money because it only cost them $ 3,000 actual dollars in the first place

pre edit pete mentioned that he feels real estate agents would a like you to buy as much house as you afford and b would love to show you three houses and have you choose one   as a real estate agent myself i believe his warnings were understated as with any industry there are good and bad people agents are paid to move houses if the median us home is under $ 200 k and commissions average say 5 the $ 10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent the $ 5000 to each is then shared with the house so this sale would net me $ 2500 gross move one a week and the income is great one per month not so much tire will waste an agent 's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting their obligation is to tell you the truth but not to offer financial advice   remember the mortgage crisis it seems the banks and brokers are n't watching out for you either they will tell you what they 'll lend you but not what you can afford these numbers are worlds apart   i strongly recommend a 20 downpayment the fha pmi calculator shows that a 90 ltv i.e. a 10 downpayment for a $ 100 k house will cost you $ in pmi think about this for the $ 10,000 that you did n't put down you are paying an extra $ 1200 each year this is on top of the interest so even at 5 that last $ 10,000 is costing nearly 17 if you ca n't raise that $ 10 k or whatever 10 is on that house in cheaper funds you should hold off using the 401(k loan for this purpose is appropriate yet emotionally charged as if suck loans are written by the devil himself   buy the biggest house you can no i have a better idea buy the smallest place you can tolerate i have a living room in addition to family room that has been used 3 times in 20 years a dining room we actually use twice per year when your house is 50 too big you pay 50 more property tax more utility bills and more maintenance closing costs commission etc is n't cheap but the lifetime cost of living in a too big house is a money pit

as an aside why does it seem to be difficult to get a conclusive answer to this question i 'm going to start by trying to answer this question and i think the answer here will help answer the other questions   here is a incomplete list of the challenges involved so my question is is there any evidence that value investing actually beats the market yes there is a lot of evidence that it works and there is a lot of evidence that it does not   's has a great link on this   some rules methods work over some periods some work during others   the most famous evidence for value investing probably comes from fama and french who were very careful and clever in solving many of the above problems and had a large persistent data set but their idea is very different from damodaran 's for instance and hard to implement though getting easier is the whole field a waste of time because of the above problems this is a hard question   some people like warren buffet have clearly made a lot of money doing this   though it is worth remembering a good amount of the money these famous investors make is off of fees for investing other peoples money   if you understand fundamental analysis well you can get a job making a lot of money doing it for a company investing other peoples money   the markets are very random that it is very hard for people to tell if you are good at it and since markets generally go up it is easy to claim you are making money for people but clearly banks and hedge funds see significant value in good analysts so it is likely not entirely random especially if you are a good writer you can make a more money here than most other jobs is it worth it for the average investor saving for retirement   very very hard to say   your time might be better spent on your day job if you have one remember because of the fees and added risk involved over say index investing more trading is hazardous to your wealth

no it is never impossible to get credit so long as there are no price controls or quotas in most of the united states the impetus for housing is so strong that it 's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation price in this case being interest rates corporate banks will not touch you now because dodd frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage   also fannie freddie who ultimately finance most mortgages in the us now require banks to buy back loans if they fail so banks are only financing the most creditworthy all is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully they find a way through in your case you can get a fully financed mortgage if you 're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit if the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state the interest rate will be even lower your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions   if you shop around you 'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get also since the cost of your prospective home is so low it 's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $ 50,000 the fha has been vastly expanded and since your individual credit is clean there may be a chance to get financing through it but be prepared for red tape

others have made excellent suggestions one thing i would add and this can not be understated is to assess your risk tolerance   we tend to think of investing as a purely rational and financial decision yet myself and so many others when times get tough make emotional decisions doing a risk tolerance test as honestly as possible will help you recognize what you can and ca n't handle    on top of that consider how well you face adversity or celebrations in other areas of life i 've found many similarities in the ways that we handle a gain in our investments to the way we celebrate a raise same thing with adversity once you know this you can begin the process of elimination on funds added the point above this does not consume a lot of time and could end up saving you a great deal of money and emotional so it 's well worth it

you should have a partnership agreement of some sort   the reason partnership agreements exist is so nobody can change the game because of the outcome    i 'd say the most typical partnership agreement is that everyone gets an equal cut meaning that everyone also makes an equal contribution   if you have start up expenses of $ 10,000 you 'd each contribute $ 5,000   separately you can determine ownership share by contribution amounts maybe one of you contributed $ 2,000 and the other $ 8,000 this would be an 80/20 split the performance of the operation does n't have anything to do with determining how to divide the pie your partnership agreement determines that   how much have you each contributed and what agreement did you make before you decided to be partners if you have a poor performing business segment then the partnership should get together and consider adjusting or stopping that line of business   but you do n't change how the pie is divided because of it unless your partnership agreement says you do

japan has entered the next phase unlimited money printing   investors have been watching japan for over a decade now wondering what happens to a country that has a debt to gdp ratio of big Â  to realistically pay off we are starting to get the answer for review japan was the first country in the modern central banking era to begin a policy of Â  quantitative easing an unconventional form of monetary policy that is used when interest rates have already been lowered to the zero bound quantitative easing which involves the purchase of printed money to buy government bonds was widely viewed in japan as a failure but what most people do n't understand about japan 's early qe experiments is that they were very small less than $ 20 billion a month it took prime minister abe and boj governor Â  to ramp up asset purchases significantly in what was called      abe japan 's prime minister photographer bloomberg      the results of have been mixed but the stock market is certainly higher and the yen is certainly lower although it 's not clear that either of those two developments have really helped japan 's stock market is mostly foreign owned and the weaker yen did n't materially help the balance of trade still there are a lot of people who said that japan 's endless debt deflation would have been worse Â  without so it has remained firmly in place for five years   rapidly began to cause distortions as accelerated asset purchases caused the bank of japan to hold a huge percentage of outstanding government bonds at 40 and rising as well as being the majority holder of index etfs investors who traffic in have remarked that the market now functions very poorly since so much of the market is held by the boj it seems that will get worse not better last year the boj implemented a policy of yield curve targeting ostensibly to help the banks keeping the overnight rate negative but targeting a 10 year rate at zero percent the boj has been buying longer dated bonds for years but this was the first time it ever explicitly capped a rate at longer maturities some people wondered how committed the boj would be to maintain that cap in the event that were caught up in a global duration selloff which we experienced in the last two weeks   as 10-year yields rose above 0.10 last week the boj announced that it was prepared to buy an Â  unlimited amount of bonds to keep yields close to zero percent as you can imagine buying an unlimited amount of 10-year involves printing a theoretically unlimited amount of yen so the yen weakened significantly on the news Â  it still remains about ten percent stronger than it was in 2015 we are getting closer to the endgame for japan what happens if yields rise further what happens if the yen depreciates significantly how much could it depreciate could japan have a currency crisis what happens if the boj ends up owning the entire bond market these are the questions that investors are asking and nobody really knows the answers we are in territory i believe that a currency crisis is n't just possible it 's inevitable and it probably happens at about the time that the boj owns all or nearly all of the market and has to resort to Â  canceling the debt this sounds like a neat magic trick to make the debt go away but the laws of economics are not to be conned anything is possible a currency crash a bond market crash anything this is the very definition of debt monetization that resulted in hyperinflation in places like weimar germany and zimbabwe is japan different we shall see we will find out soon as japan has taken a major step in that direction Â  is the Â  author of all the evil of this world and the editor of the 10th man newsletter for economics subscribe here   forbes articles have 8 tracking cookies and 9 tracking scripts this comment has r

there 's an old adage in the equities business buy on rumor sell on fact   sometimes the strategy is to buy as soon as the rumor is out about a potential merger and then sell off into the news when it is actually announced since this is normally when the biggest bounce occurs as part of a merger the other part of the analysis you should do is to understand which of the companies benefits most or is hurt the worst by the merger and then make your play accordingly   sometimes the company being acquired will see a bounce while the acquiring firm takes a hit which is an indication the experts think the acquisition will be a drag on the acquiring company perhaps because it is taking on a great deal of debt to make the acquisition or because the acquiring firm is paying too much of a premium for what it 's getting in return   other times the exact opposite is true where the company being acquired takes a hit while the buyer bounces and again the reasons for this can vary widely if you wait until the merger is actually announced then by the time you get in most of the premium from the announcement will likely have already been realized and you 'll be buying near the top of the market for the stock   the key is to be ahead of the other sellers by seeing the opportunities before they do and then knowing when to get out before everyone else does   not an easy thing to pull off when you 're trying to anticipate the markets but it can be done if you do the right research and have patience good luck

in the united states most residential real estate transactions employ a title company to process all the paperwork and transfer all the funds some paperwork has to be filed with the local government but they also have to deal with the banks mortgage companies on the two ends of the transaction at closing both parties will sign a ton of paperwork all of which was coordinated by the title company as for the funds the buyer will write a check the lender will send over the loan commitment papers for the rest of the money   how much money that depends on the purchase price the deposit the down payment the taxes and fees an other closing costs they are responsible for initial escrow inspection title insurance   the seller hopefully does n't have to write a check but if they underwater they will have to bring funds to closing from the incoming funds the title company will send money to the old lender the real estate agents the local government to record the deed   the sellers escrow money with the old lender may end up being sent back to the seller or some of the funds could be transferred to the buyer to help cover the portion of the real estate taxes from the perspective of the buyer they will only write two checks one at the start of the process for the deposit and one on closing day for their portion of the transaction the seller will hopefully walk away with a check of course determining if they will owe taxes for the transaction depends on a lot more information

note that the rules around wash sales vary depending on where you live for the u.s. the wash sale rules say that you can not buy a substantially identical stock or security within 30 days before or after your sale so you could sell your stock today to lock in the capital losses however you would then have to wait at least 30 days before purchasing it back if you bought it back within 30 days you would disqualify the capital loss event the risk of course is that the stock 's price goes up substantially while you are waiting for the wash sale period it 's up to you to determine if the risk outweighs the benefit of locking in your capital losses note that this applies regardless of whether you sell some or all of the stock or indeed if we are talking about securities other than stocks

the big issue i can see is foreign exchange risk if you 've got the money in the us and you need it in australia you 're vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies i would think that if you 're expecting to go back to the us you might want to leave some money in the us to guard against the falling against the us$ if you 're not planning to go back you 're probably better off moving the money with you unless you expect the usd to appreciate considerably against the aud anytime soon the picture changes slightly if you still have expenses in the us like paying for a mortgage or repairs to a property there or something similar as you 're probably better off leaving part of the money in the us to get rid of both the exchange rate losses and currency risk

in the short term this question is pretty simple are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   home solar is an amazingly good deal now economically the question is n't whether it 'll take over most home power generation it 's how fast that will happen   currently at least where i live the grid is still a good deal for backup power if that changes then people will stop using it   you can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for in places with gas the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kwh   so no i would n't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage i 'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally

broadly speaking a traditional account is better if you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement see for instance here   when you put the money in now you pay no taxes on it at your current high rate when you take it out you will pay taxes at your future low rate   you push the taxes onto your future lower rate self this is assuming you can deduct the contribution on the traditional ira   if you ca n't e.g. because you have an employer sponsored plan and make too much money the traditional ira does n't really gain you anything see here that is the basic story but there are some other differences to consider as well   for instance if your income is too high you can not contribute to a roth at all   also with a traditional ira you 're required to start taking money out at a certain age whereas with a roth you never have to this can make a difference if you have other retirement income and want to leave the money in the roth e.g. to pass on to your heirs without having to pay an intermediate tax at withdrawal on a more speculative level there is the possibility that tax rates may change between now and your retirement some people try to hedge against this possibility by strategically allocating their retirement assets based on whether they think tax rates will rise or fall

the crucial insight is that the alternative to early exercise of an american call is not necessarily to hold it to expiry but to sell it and selling it at its value is always better than exercising it   note that this holds only for options on assets that do n't pay dividends here 's the proof using put call parity we know that at expiry t we have using a call and a put both struck at k = k if this is not clear to you consider the case where s is less than equal to or greater than k at maturity and go through each of them if the stock s does n't pay any dividends and there is no cost of carry etc we can replicate both sides now at time 0 we just buy one call sell one put that gives us the left hand side buy the stock and borrow money so that at time t we have to repay k that gives us the right hand side that means that now we only need to borrow df k where df is the discount factor and is less than one assuming the good old world where interest rates are positive thus c(0 = df k.   rearranging gives c(0 = df k +   that 's the value of the call if we sell it or hold it however if we exercise we only get = k now we see that c(0 > because we subtract less < k and add

sensitive topic inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand   in an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods    we do n't live in an ideal world one example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy from companies that demand   most recently we 've seen wheat prices rise as fires outside moscow damaged the harvest and the russian government banned exports and that introduces the danger of inflation inflation is a signal like the pain you feel after an injury   if you simply took a you may completely ignore a broken leg until took your life governments sometimes ban inflation by fixing prices   both the and venezuelan governments have tried this recently   the consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production as pointed out governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation there is a correct level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called inflation where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6 the reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption   with a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas   consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow if prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity   if prices rise to quickly as in zimbabwe and venezuela then people can not save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all   innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices   it can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the apple iphone new types of medicines and so on the best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism   inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts we hide from it at our peril

to expand on what and some others are saying   the only way to look at it is that the parents have invested because the parents get a of the property in the end rather than the original loan amount plus interest   it is investment it is not a loan of any kind   one way to understand this is to imagine that after 20 years the property in value or halves in value   the parents participate as if they had invested in 75 ownership of the property and the op as if 25 ownership of the property note that with a loan there is a potentially changing outstanding loan balance that could be paid to end the loan to pay off the loan and there is an agreed upon an interest rate that is computed on the outstanding balance none of those apply to this situation further with a loan there is no of the property though the property may be used to secure the loan that is n't ownership basically since the situation bears none of the qualities of a loan and yet does bear the qualities of investment the parents have bought a ownership of the property the parents have invested in 75 of the real estate and the op is renting that 75 from them for the total rent the op is paying the parents for their 75 of the property is then at least $   a rental rate of $ for 75 of the property equates to a rental price of $ for the whole property this arrangement is only fair to both parties when the fair market rental value of the whole property is $ it is unfair to the op when the fair market rental value of property is less and unfair to the parents when the fair market rental value of property is more    of course the fair market rental value of the property is variable over time so the overall fairness would need to understand rental values over time i feel like this is n't actually a loan if i can never build more equity in the condo am i missing something no it is n't a loan   you and your parents are co investing in real estate   further you are renting their portion of the investment from them for comparison with a loan you have 100 ownership in the property from the start so you the owner would see all the upside downside as the property valuation changes over time whether the loan is paid off or not the borrower owes the loan balance and interest not some of the property   a loan may be secured by the property using a lien but that is quite different from ownership   typically a loan has a payment schedule setup to reduce the loan balance steadily over time so that you eventually pay it off   with a loan you gain equity the amount you own outright free clear in two ways 1 by gradually paying off the loan over time so the portion of the property grows and 2 if the valuation of the property increases over time that gain in equity is yours not the lenders   however note that the legal ownership is all 100 yours from the start are my parents ripping me off with this deal that does n't allow me to build my equity in my home you can evaluate whether you are being ripped off by comparing the $ rate to the potential rental rate for the property over time which will be a range or curve and there are real estate websites like or others to help estimate what fair market rent might be are there similar deals like this   a straight forward loan would have the borrower with 100 legal ownership from the start just that the property secures the loan   whereas with co investment there is a division of ownership that is fixed from the start    it is unusual to have both investment and loan at the same time where they are setup for gradual change between them   investment and loan can certainly be done together but would usually be done as completely separate contracts one loan one investment with no adjustment between the two over time to do both investment and loan would be unusual but certainly be possible i would imagine however that is not the case here as being described   i am not familiar with contracts that do both so as to take over the equity ownership investment over time while also reducing loan balance   perhaps some forms of rent to own work that way something to look into still usually rent to own means that until the renter owns it 100 the landlord owns 100 rather than a gradual transfer over time gradual transfer would imply co ownership for a long time something that most landlords would be reluctant to do    transfer of any particular of real estate ownership typically requires filing documents with the county and may incur fees   i am not aware of counties that allow gradual transfer with one single filing   still the courts may honor a contract that does such gradual transfer outside of county filings if so what should i do explain the situation to your parents and in particular however far out of balance the rental rate may be   decide for yourself if you want to rent vs. buy and where that property or some other   if your parents are fair people they should be open to negotiation   if not you might need a lawyer    i suspect that a lawyer would be able to find several issues with which to challenge the contract the other terms are important as well namely gross vs. net proceeds as others point out because selling a property costs a to real estate agents and possibly some taxes as well and as the others have pointed out if the property ultimately looses value that could be factored in as well it is immaterial to judging the fairness of this particular situation whether getting a bank loan would be preferable to renting 75 from the parents   further loan interest rates do n't factor into the fairness of this rental situation but of course interest rates do factor into identifying the better of various methods of investment and methods of securing a place to live e.g. rent vs. buy contributed by if your parents view this as an investment arrangement as described then you need to clarify with them if the payments being made to them are considered a buy out of their share this would allow you to gain the equity you seek from the arrangement terms would have to be or have been declared to that effect this would involve specifying some schedule and/or rates   it would have to be negotiated this it is not something that could go assumed or

an account balance is your total in the account   the word balance means to be equal the use in finance stem from accounting however you do not need to know why its called a balance to understand that a balance is equal to something ie your account balance is your total account weather its savings electric bill or investment portfolio a position in your investment portfolio is what you are invested in ie if i went 100 shares bought apple then i have a 100 share position in apple your position is added to your account balance within your investment portfolio

i would say yes it makes sense to keep some money in taxable accounts   retirement accounts are for retirement and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that   if you 're anticipating using the money before retirement e.g. for home purchase it makes sense to keep it out of retirement accounts on the other hand be aware that regardless of what kind of account it is in you face the usual risk return tradeoff   if you put your money in the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 tanks just before you were going to buy a house your down payment evaporates and you will have to wait and buy a house later   you can manage this by shifting the allocation of this money and perhaps cashing it out if a certain amount is gained i.e. it grows to the level of your target down payment and you are close enough to the house purchase time that you do n't want to risk it anymore basically if you invest money for a pre retirement use you may want to keep it in a taxable account but you also need to take account of when you 'll need it and manage the risk accordingly

i 'm surprised to even hear this question with the current state of devaluation of real estate   one thing i 'll add to the other answers is to make sure you are doing a true apples apples comparison to other investments when considering real estate you ca n't just take subtract the purchase price from the sales price to get your roi   real estate has very heavy carry costs that you need to factor into any roi calculation including one more point a house that you live in should n't be considered an investment but rather an expense you have to be able to liquidate an investment and collect your return unless you plan to move back in with your parents you are always going to need a place to live so you can never really cash out on that investment except perhaps by downgrading your lifestyle or a reverse mortgage

i think also by insurance from other the risk gets spread around and these guys actually know what they are doing i 've heard insurers sometimes do n't using really rough thumb rules like buy 2 cats and end up with suboptimal reinsurance policies but they always make sure they are covered the have a better idea of what the risk is and can outsmart the insurers when they sell the reinsurance policies    expanding on the 2 cat thing insurers need to keep enough reserves + reinsurance to cover everything the gist is if they buy 2 catastrophe insurance then the will cover losses over 2 of the portfolio so the insurers only need to cover the first 2 of their portfolio it might be a bit more complicated than this of course   they might be better keeping higher reserves than 2 self insuring more buying less re insurance or they might be better keeping less than 2 reserves and self insuring less buying more re insurance it depends on the price they negotiate with the re insurer whatever the case they have to make sure that they can cover any disaster and the government will regulate this or end up getting pressured to fund bail outs as insurers go bankrupt and home owners are left with nothing

although the market   discussion by other answers is correct the   tax structure of many developed nations i am familiar with canada in particular offers a preferred tax rate for dividend income compared to taxable gains consequently if your portfolio is large enough to make transaction fees a very small percentage rate this is a viable investment strategy   however as the preferred tax rate for dividends typically will catch up to that for capital gains at some cut off point there is a natural limit on how much income can be obtained in this way   if you believe your portfolio might be large enough to benefit from this investment strategy talk to a qualified investment advisor broker or tax consultant for the specifics for your tax jurisdiction

not always you always consider economic factors in conjunction with each other rather than in isolation which leads to weird assumptions people spending is n't what you should look at always when inflation is high means government is spending government is spending on public projects creating employment increasing salaries out loans so you are putting money into the economy and into people 's hands everybody will be spending so it will also drive pull inflation but there are differences among economists regarding cost push inflation which is a dangerous phenomena at the same time the interest rates which are a monetary tool for central banks to the money flow in the economy are low under low interest rate conditions businesses take loans to invest in projects because interest rates are low people find it logical to spend now than spend later as interest rates are low there is an expectation that they can not earn more in savings than investing in products which will generate benefits in the near term these all goes on in cycles and after a period of inflation you will see government taking action to rein in inflation it will increase interest rates to suck money out of the economy this is when people will curb spending because they know they will earn a higher return while saving rather than investing

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

one point that i do n't see covered in the other answers yet how does this affect the months that have 5 weeks do we actually lose two weeks a year i get paid every two weeks and pay day is always a friday   some months i get paid 3 times which is always great   if you live within your means it 's like an extra paycheck   all other months i get paid two times   how many months a year do i get paid 3 times 2   it will always be two because there are 12 months   if you get paid twice a month that 's 24 pay checks which is 2 shy of 26 pay checks what we would expect if we were paid every two weeks   that means those 2 extra pay checks need to fall somewhere and they will be on the months where your pay day is hit 5 times   for example in 2014 there are 4 months with 5 fridays jan may aug oct   i got paid the second friday of january so i only got 2 checks in january   i will be paid on the first friday of may which means i will get 3 checks in may.   my other triple check month this year is october so of course i am only going to be paid twice in august

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

all of these frameworks markowitz mean cara etc   sit inside a more general framework which is that returns are good and risk lack of certainty in the returns is bad and there 's a tradeoff between the two encoded as some kind of risk aversion number   you can measure lack of certainty in returns by vol weighted sum of higher moments but even sector region concentration   similarly do i want more returns or log returns or returns in the context of this tradeoff   you do n't need any formal notion of utility at that point and i do n't know what formal ideas of utility beyond i want more returns and less risk really buys you the sharpe ratio only really gets its meaning because you 've got some formal asset pricing notion of utility    in my view the moment that you 're putting constraints on the portfolio e.g. long only max weights do n't deviate too much from the benchmark really you 're operating in this more general framework anyway and you 're not in utility land anymore

this depends on what your definition of the word is is strictly speaking you are only investing in a company when you buy stock from them somehow   this is usually done during an ipo or a secondary offering   or if you are someone like warren buffet or an institutional investor you strike a deal with the company to buy shares directly from them   otherwise your money goes to someone else merriam webster defines speculate as 1b to review something or casually and often however it also defines it as 2 to assume a business risk in hope of gain especially to buy or sell in expectation of profiting from market fluctuations   the typical use of the term stock speculation vs stock investing involves definition 1b   this to the idea that little to no research was done about the stock   this may be due to a lack of time interest knowledge etc or it may be due to a lack of information   the former usually has a negative connotation   the latter may have a negative connotation though usually the connotation is one of greater risk strictly speaking definition 2 includes investing as you define it along with investing in securities commodities

i used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense but i no longer do at least in most cases   the upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate it 's less than that in the us where mortgage interest is deductible so it 's roughly the mortgage interest rate 1 your marginal income tax rate   there are a few downsides the biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions if you put that cash into your house you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you ca n't get at it without fees nor can you get at it if you do n't have a job which is when you would need it most   so you are putting your money in a hard to get at place for a small interest rate i do n't think it is worthwhile edit one complication is pmi if you are currently paying pmi it may make sense to put money towards the mortgage until you get to 20 and can get rid of the pmi

if the foreclosed property is sold for more than is owed then the borrower is entitled to the excess if sold for what is owed or less then the borrower gets nothing any money that you are entitled to would be determined by your contract with the mortgaged owner but the bank is the first lien holder they get made whole first and if there is excess then you may see some of your money back depending on your contract with the mortgaged owner since the bank owns the property until the mortgage is paid off you would have had to work with the bank in order to have legal ownership of a portion of the house and approving partial sale of a house is not something most banks would likely care to do a contract you worked up with the borrower does n't give you legal claim to the house in foreclosure at least due to the bank 's lien you 'd have to contact a lawyer for firm answers but it sounds bleak

i would say you should invest in the market that is more convenient for you bearing in mind that if you buy adrs you may have some things to keep an eye on depending on certain events as mentioned by duffbeer703 so if you are investing with an account in the u.s. go with the adrs as that will avoid some currency conversion hassles and possible exchange rate issues   i am not certain but i have a feeling that would also make it easier for you to keep the taxman happy

being long something means you own it   being short something means you have created an obligation that you have sold to someone else   if i am long 100 shares of msft that means that i possess 100 shares of msft   if i am short 100 shares of msft that means that my broker let me borrow 100 shares of msft and i chose to sell them   while i am short 100 shares of msft i owe 100 shares of msft to my broker whenever he demands them back   until he demands them back i owe interest on the value of those 100 shares   you short a stock when you feel it is about to drop in price   the idea there is that if msft is at $ 50 and i short it i borrow 100 shares from my broker and sell for $ 5000   if msft falls to $ 48 the next day i buy back the 100 shares and give them back to my broker   i pocket the difference $ 50 $ 48 = $ 2/share x 100 shares = $ 200 minus interest owed   call and put options   people manage the risk of owning a stock or speculate on the future move of a stock by buying and selling calls and puts   call and put options have 3 important components   the stock symbol they are actionable against msft in this case the strike price $ 52 in this case and an expiration june   if you buy a msft june $ 52 call you are buying the right to purchase msft stock before june options expiration 3rd saturday of the month   they are priced per share let 's say this one cost $ and sold in 100 share blocks called a contract   if you buy 1 msft june $ 52 call in this scenario it would cost you 100 shares x $ = $ 10   if you own this call and the stock spikes to $ 56 before june you may exercise your right to purchase this stock for $ 52 then immediately sell the stock at the current price of $ 56 for a profit of $ 4 share $ 400 in this case minus commissions   this is an overly simplified view of this transaction as this rarely happens but i have explained it so you understand the value of the option   typically the exercise of the option is not used but the option is sold to another party for an equivalent value   you can also sell a call   let 's say you own 100 shares of msft and you would like to make an extra $ 0.10 a share because you don't think the stock price will be up to $ by the end of june   so you go to your online brokerage and sell one contract and receive the $ 0.10 premium per share being $ 10   if the end of june comes and nobody exercises the option you sold you get to keep the $ 10 as pure profit minus commission   if they do exercise their option your broker makes you sell your 100 shares of msft to that party for the $ 52 price   if the stock shot up to $ 56 you do n't get to gain from that price move as you have already committed to selling it to somebody at the $ 52 price   again this exercise scenario is overly simplified but you should understand the process   a put is the opposite of a call   if you own 100 shares of msft and you fear a fall in price you may buy a put with a strike price at your threshold of pain   you might buy a $ 48 june msft put because you fear the stock falling before june   if the stock does fall below the $ 48 you are guaranteed that somebody will buy yours at $ 48 limiting your loss   you will have paid a premium for this right maybe $ for example   if the stock never gets down to $ 48 at the end of june your option to sell is then worthless as who would sell their stock at $ 48 when the market will pay you more   owning a put can be treated like owning insurance on the stock from a loss in stock price   alternatively if you think there is no way possible it will get down to $ 48 before the end of june you may sell a $ 48 msft june put   however if the stock does dip down below $ 48 somebody will exercise their option and force you to buy their stock for $ 48   imagine a scenario that msft drops to $ 30 on some drastically terrible news   while everybody else may buy the stock at $ 30 you are obligated to buy shares for $ 48   not good   when you sold the option somebody paid you a premium for buying that right from you   often times you will always keep this premium   sometimes though you will have to buy a stock at a steep price compared to market   now options strategies are combinations of buying and selling calls and puts on the same stock   example i could buy a $ 52 msft june call and sell a $ 55 msft june call   i would pay money for the $ 52 call that i am long and receive money for the $ 55 call that i am short   the money i receive from the short $ 55 call helps offset the cost of buying the $ 52 call   if the stock were to go up i would enjoy the profit within in $ range essentially maxing out my profit at $ what the long short call spread cost me   there are dozens of strategies of mixing and matching long and short calls and puts depending on what you expect the stock to do and what you want to profit or protect yourself from   a derivative is any financial device that is derived from some other factor   options are one of the most simple types of derivatives   the value of the option is derived from the real stock price   bingo   that 's a derivative   lotto   that is also a derivative   power companies buy weather derivatives to hedge their energy requirements   there are people selling derivatives based on the number of sunny days in omaha   remember those calls and puts on stock prices   there are people that sell calls and puts based on the number of sunny days in omaha   sounds kind of ridiculous but now imagine that you are a solar power company that gets free electricity from the sun and they sell that to their customers   on cloudy days the solar power company is still on the hook to provide energy to their customers but they must buy it from a more expensive source   if they own the sunny days in omaha derivative they can make money for every cloudy day over the annual average thus hedging their obligation for providing more expensive electricity on cloudy days   for that derivative to work somebody in the derivative market puts a price on what he believes the odds are of too many cloudy days happening and somebody who wants to protect his interests from an over abundance of cloudy days purchases this derivative   the energy company buying this derivative has a known cost for the cost of the derivative and works this into their business model   knowing that they will be compensated for any excessive cloudy days allows them to stabilize their pricing and reduce their risk   the person selling the derivative profits if the number of sunny days is higher than average   the people selling these types of derivatives study the weather in order to make their offers appropriately   this particular example is a fictitious one i do n't believe there is a derivative called sunny days in omaha but the concept is real and the derivatives are based on anything from sunny days to bls unemployment statistics to the apartment vacancy rate of nyc to the cost of a gallon of milk in maine   for every situation somebody is looking to protect themselves from something and somebody else believes they can profit from it   now these examples are highly simplified many derivatives are highly technical comprised of multiple indicators as a part of its risk profile and extremely difficult to explain   these things might sound ridiculous but if you ran a lemonade stand in omaha that sunny days derivative just might be your best friend

this sounds like a real consistency issue then when it comes to saying one thing and doing another with regard to spending money it seems common that a company just has n't figured out why that kind of consistency is important   to me it 's a question of roi if a company insists on huge money blowing events what 's the return what is that event supposed to achieve and is it worth it huge money blowing events can certainly be worth it when they actually generate long term sales significantly boost employee morale in turn generating sales hopefully or similar but as you obviously know if all the employees involved in the event feel like it 's bullshit before during and after it goes down then somebody did n't really look at the roi before approving it

in australia we have a 50 capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months whether it is in shares property or other assets the main reason is to encourage people to invest long term instead of speculating or trading the government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor so rewards people it sees taking the lower risk long term view in my opinion long term investing short term trading and speculation can all be risky for someone who is in the financial markets and the first rule of investing should be to consider the asset itself and not the tax implications

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had nâ€™t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

if you are splitting rent it is not income because you are reducing the amount of space you have available to you and reducing your rent it 's the same as if you moved to a smaller apartment you ca n't claim a deduction for rent paid so there really are no tax implications in this arrangement if you own a house and someone helps pay the mortgage that does become a rental situation if the other party has no ownership stake in the house could you find other ways to disguise it like having your brother pay utilities or buy groceries sure but i think it 's technically taxable income by the letter of the law i also do n't think the irs is going to come after you for trading a place to sleep for groceries cable

degree of operating leverage dol measures the percent change in ebit given a 1 change in revenue in other words if dol is 1.5 then increasing revenue by 1 will increase ebit by 1.5   degree of financial leverage measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in ebit   degree of total leverage cuts ebit out and measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in revenue    what all three of these numbers measure is elasticity the elasticity between two variables is always the percentage change effect on one due to a 1 change in the other    before we talk about why you would multiply let â€™s first just look at absolute changes between a change of three variables x y and z. lets say x impacts y and y impacts z to make it even more concrete let â€™s imagine a classroom where every student is required to have 2 books and every book has 100 pages so x = students y = of books and z = of pages if we add one student to the class we need to add 2 books if we add 1 book to the class we have added 100 pages with absolute changes like this it is obvious that we do nâ€™t add we multiply in other words to directly see the impact of a new student on the number of pages x -&gt z we would say 1 student -&gt 2 books -&gt 200 pages to say 102 pages would obviously be silly    for percent changes this looks pretty similar to make it easy say the class has 100 students so adding 1 student is a 1 change then we go from 200 books to 202 books a 1 change so the degree of student to book leverage is 1 which make sense there are no fixed pages we go from 20,000 pages to pages also a 1 change so the degree of book to page leverage is also 1 thus the student to page leverage is also just a flat 1    let â€™s add fixed amounts the teacher has a single 2,000 page book on how to teach we â€™ll assume the class has 20 students so we start with 20 2 + 1 = 41 books and 40 100 + 2,000 = 6,000 pages let â€™s add a student we have a -1 = 4 increase in students -1 = increase in books 1 = 3.33 increase in pages so the degree of student to book leverage is = and the degree of book to page leverage is = and the direct student to page leverage is = 1.20 again note that here it would be silly to add the degrees of leverage and when we do multiply them we get = 1.2 the right answer    from here the application to ebit = sales fixed cost variable cost = gross margin sales fixed cost and the application to eps = ebit interest taxes = 1 tax interest should be obvious i can supply the full proof mathematically however if you would like

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

are you sure you 're not just looking at prices that are adjusted for the split e.g. yahoo for example gilead sciences split a few months ago but if you look at a price chart there is n't an interruption even though the split is clearly marked look in the past six months it split in january however you could also simply be watching companies that happen to not split for a variety of reasons this is n't a criticism but rather just a consequence of whatever stocks you happen to be watching   however a quick search for information on stock splits yields a few articles mainly from the motley fool that argue that fewer companies are performing stock splits in recent years the articles mainly talk about tech companies and they make the argument that even though the shares in google and apple have a high stock price google and apple are n't all that expensive by traditional valuation    metrics google trades at just 15 times next year 's projected    profitability apple a mere 13 times fiscal 2012 's bottom line estimates these articles are a bit dated in terms of the stock prices but the rationale is probably still good similar logic could apply for other companies for example since may 2009 panera 's stock price has climbed by almost a factor of 4 without splitting the articles also make the point that stock splits were traditionally seen as bullish signs because companies splitting to bring their share prices back down to more    accessible levels were optimistic in building those sand back    up one could make a fair argument that the overall economic climate is n't as bullish as it used to be although i would only be convinced that this was affecting stock splits if data could be gathered and tested a stock split can also raise the price of a stock because if small investors feel the stock is suddenly more accessible to them they purchase more of it and might therefore drive up the price see the investopedia article on stock splits for more information companies might not see the necessity in doing this because their stock price is n't high enough to warrant a split or because the price is n't high enough to smaller investors   one interesting point to make however is that even though stock splits can drive small investors to buy more of the stock this is n't always a gain for the company because professional investors firms institutions etc have a tendency to sell after a split the paper is a bit old but it 's still a very neat read it 's possible that more and more companies no longer see any advantage to splitting because it might not affect their stock price in the long run and arguably could even hurt it considering that large professional investors likely hold a higher percentage of a company 's shares than smaller investors if a stock split triggers a wave of selling by the former the increasing propensity to buy of the latter may not be enough to offset the decline in price   note my answer only refers to standard stock splits the reasons above may not apply to a decrease in the number of reverse stock splits which may not be a phenomenon i do n't know

well again i think you 're grasping at straws to try to justify monopoly   it 's entirely possible that in a free market there will be some rich individuals who choose to risk it all and hire a small army to attack their enemies or destroy property   but the whole point is that their armies will be far less powerful than the militaries governments currently have and they wo n't have popular acceptance as legitimate   i 'm well aware that anarchy would n't be a cake walk   the only claim i 'm making is that it would be superior to what we currently have a system whereby a monopolist millions of people each year for 1/3 of their income and their children for the first 18 years of their lives   that kind of centralization of power is extremely dangerous   gt;your security will have to be handled somehow do you think calling something a fee perhaps fundamental nature of the payment   of course not   we believe that people should pay for their security voluntarily just like they pay for their food and clothes   most people probably would n't even need security just some cameras a fence and a small gun   some societies are more violent than others naturally   we do n't expect to spring up in a particularly violent society as they tend to property rights anyway   we think its will happen in a first world atheist non violent country like denmark or new zealand   gt;again explicitly how are you going to handle security   i take with the way you 've phrased this   i will not be handling anything   it is up to consumers to decide what is best for them and entrepreneurs to experiment to determine the best way to do things   the market is a system of trial and error like the scientific process   here 's a video of one possible way it could be done

there is n't a formula like that there is only the greed of other market participants and you can try to predict how greedy those participants will be if someone decided to place a sell order of 100,000 shares at $ 5 then you can buy an additional 100,000 shares at $ 5 in reality people can infer that they might be the only ones trying to sell 100,000 shares right then and raise the price so that they make more money they will raise their sell order to $ $ or as high as they want until people stop trying to buy their shares it is just a non stop auction just like on ebay

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

traditionally dealers and broker dealers were in contact with the actual producers of a product or issuers of a security selling it at the exchange on their behalf   consumers would traditionally be on the buy side of course these days anyone can enter the market on either side   even if you do n't hold the security or product you could sell it and take on the risk of having to stock up on it by the delivery date in exchange for cash or other securities   on the other side if you ca n't hold the product or security you could still buy it taking on the risk of having to dispose of it somehow by delivery in exchange for cash or other securities in either case you the sell side take on risk and provide products securities cash   this is most commonly known as market making   modern literature coins the terms liquidity taker buy side and liquidity provider sell side   even more accurately risk management literature would use the terms risk taker sell side and risk or risk buy side this is quite illustrative in modern abstract markets   take a market that allows for no offsetting or hedging because the product in question is abstract or theoretical e.g. weather trading volatility trading inflation trading etc   there 's always one party trying to eliminate dependence on or correlation to the product the risk buy side and the counterparty taking on their risk sell side

edit to answer what i think you question is i do not know of anything other than trip cancellation insurance   and you must be very careful that the policy you purchase for your trip covers the circumstance you described   essentially you opted not to take the flight   not all trip cancellation policies will cover that how to find trip cancellation insurance getting your money back now this is an act of god in the insurance world   you can not reasonably expect the airline to know the future weather pattern anymore than you could and therefore since the plane did fly you owe them the money based on the ticket you bought   you did n't just buy a ticket there is a contract with rules about refunds and transferring and such it is a bummer situation and i understand you point of view but this is n't the airline 's fault if anybody is to blame for you missing your flight and therefore not getting a refund it is your employer   their requirements for you be in one city and then another are the cause    while your employer can not predict the weather they are ultimately the ones who could give you the okay to be late   if you absolutely can not be late and it was critical that you drive out and miss your flight then your company gets to pay for the flight and the car   that is the cost of doing business for them this is also why when flying for business that you pay the higher price and get the refundable transferable ticket   they cost more but situations like these illustrate they are worth it for the company

generally bank transfers are not in themselves liable for tax however making profit generally is taxed either as income capital gains or some combination of the two it seems that in the uk cryptocurrencies are being treated like other currencies for tax purposes and that trading profits losses may count as either income or capital gains depending on the circumstances however i do not know how to unravel whether particular trading activity would count as income or capital gains i would suggest gathering as much information as possible and then discussing this with an accountant

i do n't know the legal framework for rsus so i 'm not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them i recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the vest date so even if i got a shares for $ 1 granted to me if it was 100 shares that vested at $ 100 on the 1st then i would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest further the company would withhold 25 of the vest for federal taxes and 10 for state taxes if i lived in a state with income tax the withholding rate was flat regardless of what my actual tax rate was capital gains on the change from the market value on the vest date was calculated as short term or long term based on the time since the vest date so if my 100 shares went up to $ 120 i would pay the $ 20 difference as short term or long term based on how long i had owned them since the vest that said i do n't know if this is universal your hr folks should be able to help answer at least some of these questions though i know their favorite response when they do n't know is that you should consult a tax professional good luck

you start taking on some big risks when go to absolute zero unlike your plane analogy you do n't have to fly or not fly you can opt to take a safer hybrid form of transit or to extend the analogy now you 're driving or walking instead of flying which per mile traveled is statistically more risky even if the plane feels and looks riskier   consider reading up a bit on the risks of all cash bonds including shortfall and inflation yes real estate is a hedge but most of your portfolio is still exposed to inflation why not also buy some treasury inflation protected securities via a bond fund why not put 25 in the stock market to help do well when the markets do well   i think if you do some reading on this you 'll find yourself shocked at the risks of being all cash fwiw i 'm a relatively conservative voice on investing subreddits the guy who is usually saying hey be sure to keep some so i 'm all about a safe balanced portfolio but tilt too far in either direction and you take on more risk not less   you mentioned a pension and real estate those are presumably good inflation hedges and relatively stable holdings the pension especially suggests you can take more stock risk since you have that stable bond like holding   the thing to me is that you would be all in during the good times if you 're this risk adverse when you see warning signs i 'm curious were you 100 stocks before totally on off like that seems kinda intense

an interesting read   as of lately my office has been getting calls from fidelity first trust and now regarding their etfs   a lot of them just received their 3 year number and the companies are trying to get inflows into them   's has not launched yet but is expecting to drop end of summer or early fall   fidelity is currently the only major competitor in the space   they have a slightly lower internal cost compared to vanguard and their position are almost identical to the ishares etfs offered by black rock   you can think of black rock as bounty brand paper towels while fidelity is more like kirkland signature   essentially the same thing with a slight savings on price   one thing to look out for is the very thin trading volume on some of these new etfs   and have very thin levels of volume which makes owning them feel like a game of old maid   you do n't want to be stuck holding the bag if something happens in the sector etf that was purchased   always make sure there is a market for some of these etfs before you buy it   fidelity has overcome some of these volume problems but some of the etfs are still a little thin   just stick with vanguard for the thinly traded sectors and consider fidelity if you want to shave a few bps on internal cost     this has just been my personal observation of the industry

if a company earns $ 1 million in net profit let 's say all cash which is not entirely realistic it can do one of three things with it on the balance sheet profits that have not been distributed show up as retained earnings   when dividends are paid retained earnings and cash are reduced none of the other options change the fact that it is still profit they all just affect the balance sheet not the income statement note that when a company issues dividends it reduces its per share value since cash is leaving the door with nothing in return    in apple 's case since a significant amount of its profit was earned in other countries where it was not taxed by the us it would pay a significant amount in us corporate tax by bringing it back to the us by investing it or paying dividends they are betting that at some point the us will change the rules to make it more favorable to repatriate the money and reduce their tax significantly

i do n't like your strategy   do n't wait   open an investment account today with a low cost providers and put those funds into a low cost investment that represents as much of the market as you can find i am going to start by assuming you are a really smart person   with that assumption i am going to assume you can see details and trends and read into the lines   as a computer programmer i am going to assume you are pretty task oriented and that you look for optimal solutions now i am going to ask you to step back   you are clearly very good at managing your money but i believe you are over thinking your opportunity reading your question you need a starting place and some managed expectations so here is your plan now that you have a personal retirement account ira roth ira and perhaps a 401(k or equivalent at work you can start to select which investments go into that account   i know that was your question but things you said in your question made me wonder if you had all of that clear in your head the key point here is do n't wait   you wo n't be able to time the market certainly not consistently   get in now and stay in   you adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance as you age and you adjust your investments based on your wealth and needs   but get in now    over the course of 40 years you are likely to be working sometimes the market will be up and sometimes the market will be down but keep buying in   because every day you are in you money can grow and over 40 years the chances that you will grow substantially is pretty high   no need to wait start growing today things i did n't discuss but are important to you

one approach is to control your budget more effectively for example work out your essential living expenses things like food rent and other bills you are committed to and compare this to your regular income   then you can set up a regular automatic payment to a savings account so you limit the disposable income in your current account if you keep a regular check on this balance it should make you feel like you have less spare money and so less temptation to spend on impulse purchases   similarly    it may help to set a savings goal for something you really do want even if this is itself   a bit frivolous it will at least help you to discipline yourself   equally it may be useful to set a fixed budget for luxuries then you have a sense that when it 's gone it 's gone but you do n't have to completely deny yourself

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save Â£ 700 month from Â£ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve Â£ 100 from Â£ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

i have done this and the reason is to make sure that i do n't run out of money in my account to place the order if there is an unexpected upswing in price suppose i have $ 1000 in my account and i want to buy 10 shares of that are currently at $ 99   if the price does n't change then i am all set but if the price goes up to $ 101 then i do n't have sufficient funds to make the purchase by placing a limit order at $ 100 i can ensure that i have enough money to place the order in general it is a rather unlikely scenario that it could happen but placing the limit order is easy to do and it gives me peace of mind i do n't know what you mean about bypassing the queue

to quote the answer you linked to perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement so if your business purchased the $ 1000 gift card for $ 800 you should see a $ 800 charge appearing on a business cc or bank statement you would therefore be able to deduct the $ 800 but not the full $ 1000 of items that you purchase with it side notes

yes it 's called the rate of inflation the rate of return over the rate of inflation is called the real rate of return    so if a currency experiences a 2 rate of inflation and your investment makes a 3 rate of return your real rate of return is only 1 one problem is that inflation is always backwards looking while investment returns are always forward looking there are ways to calculate an expected rate of inflation from foreign exchange futures and other market instruments though that said when comparing investments typically all investments are in the same currency so the effect of inflation is the same and inflation makes   no difference in a comparative analysis   when comparing investments in different currencies then the rate of inflation may become important

the company gets the proceeds from the sales of shares on the open market if a company is selling 1,000,000 shares at $ then they will receive $ from the underwriter minus some fees that the underwriter will collect the part that ties into valuation is to consider what percentage is the company selling of itself that is coming from its own holdings if the company is putting out 10 of its shares in the ipo from treasury holdings on a $ 10b valuation then it will get $ 1b minus the fees i 'd suspect where i worked in late 1990s early 2000s had an ipo where the underwriter did a bridge loan and the ipo so that the company did n't get all the money raised but did get enough to run operations for a while before ending operations public offering notes that after an ipo other offerings would be called seasoned equity offering that may or may not be as they could come from new or existing shares

i do n't know chinese purchasing power has been steadily advancing i think that it 's a total cost of goods thing the total cost to manufacture package ship warehouse pay import export taxes etc all of that must be at a tipping point such that us is now the cheaper option   just because we can spend more would n't by itself force the relocation of a factory the input costs would have to be reduced to make the economics work it 's the exact opposite wage driven circumstance that resulted in factories being off in the first place    to repatriate manufacturing jobs the only thing that would have changed in any dramatic way would be the direct manufacturing wages

they used to pay over 90 during the glorious 30s 1940 1970 all of this is about the capture of politicians by the rich both democrats and republicans and the balance of power between labor and capital which has tilted on favor of capital as warren buffet said there is a class war and we are winning it with the free movement if capital it 's super easy for the super rich to get their money out of a country   now regarding of taxes and their level if you posit that taxes take away your hard earned work then both 10 and 90 are unacceptable it 's like a thief arguing he only stole 10 of a bank how is it more or less acceptable    of course i do n't subscribe to this logic at all i just want to point out that either any level of taxation is fair regardless of the level or unfair there are n't any in    to finish i would use market mechanisms to set taxation taxes on the super rich should be gradually increased until there is a noticeable effect on productive investment

based on my research the answer is both you would pay taxes on the bitcoin you mine as income and then capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit or capital loss if you lose value on the sale   you can write off a portion of your electricity bill and hardware purchased for the use of mining as a business expense but it 's recommended that you consult a tax professional for determining the proper amount that is eligible for a deduction   from forbes new bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by    a process called mining in mining computers running the bitcoin    software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first    computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent    transactions to the ledger of all bitcoin transactions plus receives    the new bitcoins created by the system called the block reward if you are a miner and win the block reward you must record the fair    market value of bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your    personal or business income also note the date and timestamp at which    your coins were mined later when you dispose of those bitcoin you    will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal and    you will be taxed a long term capital gains rate on any bitcoin you    held for more than a year and a short term capital gains rate on any    bitcoin you held for a year or less the timestamp is nâ€™t absolutely    necessary but is helpful to validate the order of multiple    acquisitions or within a day the amount you pay in taxes on a long term capital gain will depend on    your income tax bracket while short term capital gains are taxed the    same as ordinary income from   another clarification in the irs 's march notice was how mining should    be treated mining is income on the day of receipt of any coins and    at the fair value of those coins this means that if you mined any    bitcoins or alt coins either solo as part of a pool or through a    cloud provider you need to report any coins you received as income where it is less clear is what that dollar value might be since the    fair value is not always as easy to determine   bitcoins    are all examples of where there is a direct usd market and    so you can easily find out their value of any given day however a    newly created alt coin that was mined in its early days has no direct    market and so how do you determine its value or for any alt coin    e.g. abc coin that has no direct usd market but does have a btc    market does it have a value do you have to make a conversion from    abc to btc to usd   since there is no clarification yet from the irs on    this issue you should discuss how to proceed with your own tax    professional has taken a prudent approach and calculates    value where a fiat or btc market exists converting an alt coin to btc    to usd as necessary and from bitcoin magazine the irs also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at    the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining most do nâ€™t know they can write off any losses they have said    founder the irs allows you to offset income by up to    $ 3,000 per year on capital losses   if you have losses and you are nâ€™t    writing them off then it â€™s like throwing money away nobody likes    doing taxes but if you can owe less or increase your return then    doing your bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit in fact the    majority of our users are filing a capital loss which means they â€™ve    actually saved money by using our tool   also gives insight for miners   mining is considered income so know the price of bitcoin at the time    you mined it he said if you make money on bitcoin trading the irs    requires that you report gains with line level detail   the    appropriate form for that is 8949 a sub form of schedule d. gains and    losses as outlined above are treated like every other capital asset
