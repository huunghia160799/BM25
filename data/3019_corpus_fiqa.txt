the $ 20k limit seems to be from another answer the threshold for gofundme to report the campaign however such a report does not change the taxability of the income the income is either taxable or non taxable regardless of whether the amount is $ or $ this is a common misconception commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below $ 600 when in reality $ 600 is the threshold for issuing a form 1099 given that it would be foolish to close a wildly successful gofundme campaign because closing the campaign wo n't change the taxability of the income but it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received with the amount of money at stake you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a cpa to look at your specific situation your uncle 's comments are not specific to your situation at best incorrect at worst so do n't hire him i do n't know what the median gofundme campaign raises but i strongly suspect it 's well below the $ donor reporting limit just because you have one campaign that 's gone viral enough to approach that limit does n't mean if you close that one and start a new one that it will go viral again especially if it 's under a new username

from wepay gofundme 's payment processor support i received only gifts and donations   will i receive a form 1099-k    as of 2015 the irs has clarified that wepay is not required to send     a form 1099-k with respect to payments that are made solely as gifts    or donations   the purpose of form 1099-k is to report payments for    the provision of goods or services which may be subject to tax    gifts and donations typically are not reported as income by recipients    so it is not necessary to send them a form

i 'm going to post this as an answer because it 's from the gofundme website but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it   am i responsible for taxes us only while this is by no means a guarantee donations on gofundme are    simply considered to be personal gifts which are not for the most    part taxed as income in the us however there may be particular    case specific instances where the income is taxable dependent on    amounts received and use of the monies etc      we 're unable to    provide specific tax advice since everyone 's situation is different    and tax rules can change on a yearly basis we advise that you    maintain adequate records of donations received and consult with your    personal tax adviser      additionally wepay will not report the funds    you collect as earned income it is up to you and a tax professional    to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income the    person who 's listed on the wepay account and ultimately receives the    funds may be responsible for taxes      again every situation is    different so please consult with a tax professional in your area en us i responsible for taxes us and here 's a blurb from which adds to the confusion but enforces the speak with a professional idea crowdfunding services have to report to the irs campaigns that total    at least $ 20,000 and 200 transactions money collected from    crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift this is where things get a little tricky if money donated is not a    gift or investment it is considered taxable income even a gift could    be subject to the gift tax but that tax applies only to the gift    giver non taxable gifts these are donations made without the expectation of getting something    in return think of all those fans who gave money to    gofundme to help the cost of tom ’s nfl fine    for those fans are n’t expecting anything in return    except maybe some satisfaction so their donations are considered    gifts under irs rules an individual can give another individual a    gift of up to $ 14,000 without tax implications so unless a fan    is particularly generous his or her gofundme gift wo n’t be taxed taxable income now consider that same fan donating $ 300 to a business    venture if the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return    for the donation this is considered an investment and is not taxable    however if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the    company the money donated could be considered business income and the    recipient would need to report it on a tax return

to echo part of response if it 's taxable there would be tax on $ just a bit less than on $ 20,000 your uncle may have a credential and members here may not but still he may be mistaken or he could be giving you advice on how to skirt the law   the taxability and the $ 20,000 threshold are unrelated trying to avoid the    $ 20,000 is a completely misplaced effort gifts from anyone are not taxable to the recipient so long as nothing is received in return it 's not taxable income to her in contrast a blogger with a tip jar is soliciting money in exchange for advice entertainment etc that 's taxable donations to individuals in the circumstance you describe are not income to her nor are they deductible to the donor   edit a fellow blogger more than that she 's my tax crush had an article cancer survivor gets $ tax bill for gofundme donations which may render my answer incorrect other article on this story suggest that the irs is notified but the nature of the transfer needs to be addressed   in my opinion you should find a new uncle cpa

the only reason i can think of would be if you were convinced that you could n't hold on to your money treasury bonds are often viewed as very safe investments and often used in some situations where cash is n't appropriate also they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme helping your country to grow in addition many people do n't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds but are just investing in them the more people investing in them the lower the yields become but the bottom line is i would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate and it looks like i 'm in good company as well a quick study of reports seems to indicate that these are a very bad investment

here 's an alternative there are hundreds maybe thousands of contract engineering firms job shops in the united states probably hundreds in california alone   they are in the business of doing what your employer wants you to do they know how to do it they have been doing it for decades working with the biggest most established companies in the country   they have forgotten more about providing engineering services to clients and paying the engineers than you can learn in a lifetime call a few of them   set up meetings   budget a few hours for it   you want to talk with the most experienced recruiter in the office the old guy who has been there and done that   explain your situation and tell them that rather than go through all of the headaches yourself you want to investigate the possibility of them handling all the headaches for their usual markup of course   you can probably word this better than i can but you get the idea the shop may or may not be willing to talk about their markup   my personal opinion is that this is perfectly ok   what they make off of you after your rate is paid is their business also talk about what you do and your recommended rate   it would not surprise me to learn that you are currently grossly underpaid and mention that if the client declines you 're going to be available immediately and you 'd certainly be open to working with them   you will see this again   in fact if they have any current leads that you fit you would certainly be interested in hearing about them   they may already have a from another client for which you fit for which the client is willing to pay much more than your current employer if it were me personally i 'd start with and maybe tad technical   these are three of the oldest and best i 'd also hit up ce weekly get a subscription and find some other shops with offices in your area once you have a shop lined up then ask your employer if rather than you setting up a personal corporation they 'd be willing to work with an established contract engineering firm   who does this kind of thing for a living who does this every day who has been doing this for decades   doing this is simpler for everyone and by going through an established firm they avoid having to teach you how to do business with them   they also avoid the risk of having you reclassified by irs as an employee which exposes them to all kinds of legal and financial liability if they say no walk away from them   immediately   they 've just thrown up a huge red flag   this is where the other discussions with the shop come into play

that 's just his base salary for last year   keep reading in the article he also received $ 1.6 million worth of plus he 's probably earned plenty in salary bonuses and other compensation in previous years to more than keep up his lifestyle   he can also sell relatively small amounts of the stock he already owns to get millions in cash without raising an how are people able to spend more than what they make without going into debt well people ca n't spend more than they have without going into debt certainly money can be saved won inherited whatever without being earned   other than that debt is the only option that said many wealthy people will spend way more than they have by going into debt   this can be done through huge mortgages personal loans using stock real estate or other assets as collateral etc   i do n't know about bezos specifically but it 's not uncommon for wealthy people to live beyond their means they just have more assets behind them to secure personal loans or bankers are more willing to lend them unsecured money because of the large interest rates they can charge   their assumption is presumably that the interest they 'll pay on these loans is less than the earnings they 'll get from the asset e.g. stock real estate   while it may be true in some cases it can also go bad and cause you to lose everything

diamonds are intrinsically worthless and therefore have quite little resale value it may be true that de beers has a near monopoly on diamond supply but they are still a scarce resource so their supply is still very limited   they do have resale value that 's one reason why diamond jewelry is stolen so often there 's just not a huge secondary market for diamonds that i know of unlike cars for example   you can sell diamond jewelry at pawn shops or online brokers but you probably only get a fraction of their retail value they are not intrinsically worthless   they do have value in the industrial sector as powerful cutters although synthetic diamonds are much more prevalent in this market   their value in industry is much lower than their worth as jewelry think about gold it does not have a supplier but it still has a relatively very high value

i knew before i clicked that this was going to refer to i do n't mean to his scholarship but he 's clearly a guy with an agenda for example the reason this number is so outrageous is because 2010 was a terrific year for the stock market and a to bad year for employment and wage growth stocks tend to be a leading indicator while job growth is a trailing one in fact also tries to make hay by comparing the first two years of this recovery with the entirety of the much longer 90 's and 00 's booms if you target your analysis at years when the market has recovered but jobs have n't of course you 'll see greater income gains for the investor class   but by that same token could have been putting out press releases for studies in 2008 showing how the rich were getting absolutely screwed by losing the lion 's share of their income as the market tanked while ordinary folks were perhaps losing only a little because the full force of job losses had n't hit yet but he did n't afaik

i 've considered simply moving my funds to an australian bank to lock in the current rate but i worry that this will put me at risk of a substantial loss due to exchange rates transfer fees etc when i move my funds back into the us in 6 months   why move funds back   if you want to lock in current exchange rates figure out how much money you are likely to spend in australia for the next six months   move just enough funds to cover that to an australian bank   leave the remainder in the united states us as your future expenses will be in us dollars    so long as you do n't find some major unanticipated purchase this covers you   you have enough money for the next six months with no exchange rate worries    at the end of the six months if you fall slightly short cover with your credit card as you are doing now   you 'll take a loss but on a small amount of money   if you have a slight excess and you were right about the exchange rate you 'll make a little profit at the end   if you were wrong you 'll take a small loss    the key here is that you should be able to budget for your six months   you can lock in current exchange rates just for that amount of money    moving all your funds to australia is a gamble   you can certainly do that if you want but rather than gambling it may be better to take the sure thing   you know you need six months expenses so just move that   you will definitely be spending six months money in australia so you are immune to exchange rate fluctuations for that period   the remainder of your money can stay in the us as that 's where you plan to spend it    however recent political events back in the states have me and i 'm sure every currency speculator and foreign investor worried that this advantage will not last for much longer   if currency speculators expect exchange rates to fall then they 'd have already bid down the rates   i.e. they 'd keep speculating until the rates did fall   so the speculators expect the current rates are correct otherwise they 'd move them    donald trump 's state goal is to increase exports relative to imports   if he 's successful this could cause the us dollar to fall to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive   however if his policies fail then the opposite is likely to happen   most of his announced trade policies are more likely to increase the value of the dollar than to decrease it   in particular that is the likely result of increased tariffs    if you are worried about trump failing then you should worry about a strong dollar   that 's more in line with actual speculation since the election    i do n't know that i 'd make a strong bet in either direction   hedging makes more sense to me as it simply locks in the current situation which you apparently find favorable   not hedging at all might produce some profit if the dollar goes up   gambling all your funds might produce some profit if the dollar goes down   the middle path of hedging just what you 're spending is the safest if least likely to produce profit    my recommendation is to hedge the six months expenses and enjoy your time abroad   why worry about political events that you ca n't control   enjoy your working studying vacation

you do n't have to use an agent broker as you call it but it is strongly advised in some counties lawyers are required in some not check your local requirements similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and of money you will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service i 'm guessing here but it makes sense to me you will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company and it might be hard without an agent agents required by law to know all the details of the process and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into they have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports they know what to demand from the seller disclosures information etc they know how and from where to get the hoa docs and disclosures and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales comparable listings list vs sales statistics etc it is hard to do all that alone but if you do you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly i bought several properties in california and in other states and i would n't do it without an agent on my side but if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title mortgage insurance or resale then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent and there are people doing that

i 've seen a lot of long and complicated answers here so here is my simple and short answer let 's say the economy consists of 10 apples and then an apple costs if you print 10 $ more you have 10 apples and then an apple costs that is it it 's not what said   over time prices go up however i would like to add something more on the topic inflation is theft if i hack the bank and steal 10 from each account it 's obvious that it is theft it 's a bit less obvious when the government prints out money and people loose 10 of the value in their bank accounts but the end result is the same final note some may disagree but i do not consider inflation when 5 of the apples rot and you have 5 apples and 10 $ and an apple now costs this is a drop in supply and if the demand stays the same prices will rise

my recommendation would be to pay off your student loan debt as soon as possible you mention that the difference between your student loan and the historical long term return on the stock market is one half percent   the problem is the 7 return that you are counting on from the stock market is not guaranteed   you might get 7 over the next few years but you also might do much worse   the 6.4 interest that you will save by aggressively paying off your debt is guaranteed you are concerned about the opportunity cost of paying your debt early   however this cost is only temporary   by drawing out your debt payments you have a long term opportunity cost   by this i mean that 4 years from now you could still have 6 years of debt payments hanging over your head or you could be debt free with all of your income available to save spend or invest as you see fit in my opinion debt just to try to come out 0.5 ahead is not worth the hassle or risk

i have worked for companies that have done this one did have a match and the other did not when they figured their profit at the end of the year a portion was given to the employees as a 401 k deposit   retirement and profit sharing plan contribution limits total annual contributions annual additions to all of your accounts    in plans maintained by one employer and any related employer are    limited the limit applies to the total of elective deferrals employer matching contributions employer nonelective contributions allocations of the annual additions paid to a participant ’s account can not exceed the    lesser of 100 of the participant 's compensation or $ $ 60,000 including catch up contributions for 2017   $ 53,000    $ including catch up contributions for 2016 so as long as everything stays below that $ limit you are good in one case the decision was made by the company for the employee the other company gave us the option of bonus check or 401k. i heard that most of the employees wanted the money in the 401k.

incoming is often free except from overseas i 've never found a bank offering free international wire transfers is this coming from a foreign country or another part of the usa if it is from a foreign country at some banks hsbc perhaps you can get us$ checks for us payments at a lower cost than a wire transfer but you have to be careful because the exchange rate might be different if the transfers occur wholly within the usa there is really no good reason to use wire transfer if you can avoid it   ach is usually free and is the same way direct deposit works   use that or if it is within a family like for college you could even use checks

if you place your emergency fund in your tfsa you can withdraw it at any time e.g. in an emergency and then replace the withdrawn money in the next calendar year be careful there you pay a hefty fine if you replace it in the current calendar year if this leads to an overcontribution it 's not an either or thing though you could invest the money in a mutual fund inside your tfsa i strongly recommend against this for your emergency fund however the whole point of an emergency fund is that you may need it immediately so keep it in an investment that you can liquidate quickly cash or very near cash while i obviously do n't know your specific situation i needed $ 10,000 within 24 hours and another $ 10,000 within two weeks during an emergency in a world where you have large sums of money you 'd max out your rrsp and tfsa with investments and keep your emergency fund outside of both but most of us are n't in that situation in that case it makes sense to use your tfsa for your emergency fund i use some of my tfsa space for my emergency fund savings account paying low interest though people often like gics and some for investment passive indexed stocks and bonds note that you need to pay taxes on your savings account interest too if held outside your tfsa and rrsp accounts

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

the easiest options appear to be to open an account with one of the large multinational banks like citi they have options such as opening two separate checking accounts one in each currency and citi in particular has an international account that appears to make currency personal banking easier all of the options have minimum balance requirements or fees for conversion but if you need quick access this seems to be the best bet even if this is a one time event and you do n't need the account a bank like citi may be able to help you cash the check and get access to the funds quicker than a national or local bank alternatively if you know anyone with a us bank account you can deposit it with them and take the cash withdrawal from their account assuming they agree the check is n't too large etc

now the question is advisable for a beginner to speculate in cfds   no if not is there a better way to invest with a small amount of money in the us and i 'm sure this carries to the uk most if not all big brokerages schwab td ameritrade fidelity vanguard etc have a set of funds that are zero load and zero commission though the fund will still have an expense ratio   this is the barclay 's uk page related to zero cost investing in the barclay 's funds   barclay 's might not be the right fit for a beginner as it seems there is a hefty account minimum but the same zero commission concept exists in the uk   again most of these brokerages will also have an extremely low expense ratio s&p index or some other market index fund   as a beginner that 's where you should start this is not meant to patronize beginners it 's just math   assume your trade commission is £ 7   if your investment is £ 100 you 'll lose £ 7 right up front to the buy commission then another £ 7 when you sell   lets say your position raises 10 you 'll be at a net loss of 4.7 meanwhile if you put your £ 100 in to a 0.1 expense fee mutual fund with no transaction commissions and no load fees after a 10 gain you 'd owe £ due to the expense ratio at the of the year   you 'd have £ beginners get crushed by fees and commission   it is not advisable by any stretch of the imagination to attempt to day trade or actively manage a portfolio of any sort of security and commodities and currency are the worst place to start

credit is not free money the idea is you will repay all of it within a reasonable amount of time it is abundantly clear you either do n't really understand this concept or completely failed at planning for it or even at keeping up with how much you owe you are blaming the bank for letting you go over the limit the reason most banks will authorize that for credit customers is they do n't want to people in some sort of an emergency situation i 'd recommend you cut back on your spending and work on paying the balance down if you have been charged any over the limit fees you can attempt to negotiate getting those credited most banks will compromise on that the first time i do n't really recommend it but if there are some circumstances surrounding this that are temporary and you are very confident about being able to manage money better in the future chances are you might be able to get approved for another card if you otherwise have had some good credit history and this situation is very recent it may not even show up on your credit report yet and another bank might happily approve you they may even offer a low or zero interest for some time balance transfer deal which you should use to get the other card within the limit if that ends up working it 's very important that you keep in mind having dodged the bullet once does n't mean you will ever be able to do it again get your budget in order and pay things off

from your description it seems that you should have $ 75k of basis i.e. after tax amount in your traditional ira as others have mentioned in comments you might have had to report this in the year it was rolled over i will assume that you will have figured this out having after tax amounts in a traditional ira is tricky as you usually ca n't choose to take out only the after tax portion withdrawals as well as conversions to roth ira must be pro rata which means that the amount of pre tax and post tax money in the withdrawal or conversion follows the same proportion as in the ira overall so say 7.5 of your traditional ira is after tax and the other is pre tax that means any withdrawal will consist of pre tax and post tax in those proportions so e.g. if you withdraw or convert $ 1000 $ 75 will be post tax and $ will be pre tax so any withdrawal or conversion will consist overwhelmingly of pre tax amounts which will be taxed and you may not want that at this time there is one way to separate the pre tax and post tax amounts in a traditional ira but it involves having an active 401(k which i doubt you have at this point as you 're retired some 401(k plans allow people to rollover funds from traditional ira into it if they allow this then you can use it to siphon only pre tax money from the traditional ira as irs does not allow rollover of post tax money into a 401(k this way you can rollover the entire pre tax amount of the traditional ira into the traditional 401(k leaving behind only after tax money in the traditional ira which you can immediately convert to roth ira with no tax

if i open and fill an isa then leave the account alone for an entire year will i then be able to add an additional £ insert isa limit here to the original money i put in the account   yes you can will the full sum of £ last years limit + £ this years limit that is in the account have interest paid on it yes it will will the account be closed at the end of the period regardless no the account would only be closed if you requested it to be closed otherwise it would sit there with the original balance in it earning interest at the stated rate the only way i can see an isa being of any worth is by building up a substantial amount this way but you would need so much cash laying around to max the isa year on year just think of an isa as like a completely normal savings account except that you do n't pay tax on the interest and there is a limit to how much you can deposit in any given year   right now while interest rates have been low for a while the savings rates on any account including isas are not desperately attractive additionally with the recent changes to how interest on normal savings accounts are taxed isas are not quite such a big deal as they used to be   if you look back to a time when interest rates were around 5 a higher rate tax payer with £ 50,000 in a normal savings account would earn £ 2500 interest in a year on which they would pay £ 1000 in tax that made an isa a very attractive option indeed

based on the information you gave there are dozens if not hundreds of possible theories one could spin about the rental market sure it 's possible that there are no listings because rental units on this street are quickly snapped up on the other hand it 's also possible that there are no listings because almost all the buildings on the street have been abandoned and aside from this one property that someone is tying to sell you the rest of the street is only by wild dogs and/or drug dealers or maybe the street is mostly owner occupied i.e. the properties are not being rented to anyone or maybe it 's a commercial district or maybe craigslist is n't popular with people who own property on this street for whatever reason maybe syracuse has a city ordinance that says property must be advertised in the newspaper and not on websites for all i know or maybe you missed it because nobody in syracuse calls it housing for rent they all call it apartments for rent or houses for rent or some local phrase or or or before i bought a property i 'd do more research than one search on one web site have you visited the property i do n't know how much you 're preparing to invest i have no idea what property prices are in syracuse but i 'd guess it 's at least tens of thousands of dollars surely worth making the drive to syracuse to check it out before buying

this is called the ask bid spread the difference varies based on the of the asset the more liquid or the higher the volume of trades for the asset then the smaller the spread is the spread goes to the broker to pay for some of the cost of the trade my guess is that when there is a higher volume of shares being traded brokers need to take less of a fee per share out of the transaction to cover their costs this makes the spread is smaller   this is essentially the difference in    price between the highest price that a    buyer is willing to pay for an asset    and the lowest price for which a    seller is willing to sell it the seller will get the bid price and the buyer will pay the ask and the broker keeps the spread from

other responses have focused on getting you software to use but i 'd like to attempt your literal question how are such transactions managed in systems that handle them i will answer for double entry bookkeeping software such as quicken or gnucash my choice disclaimer i am not an accountant and accountants will probably find error in my terminology your credit card is a liability to you and is tracked using a liability account as opposed to an asset account such as your bank accounts or cash in your pocket a liability account is just like an asset except that it is subtracted from rather than added to your total assets or from another perspective its balance is normally negative the mathematics works out identically when you make a purchase using your credit card the transaction you record transfers money from the liability account increasing the liability to the expense account for your classification of the expense when you make a payment on your credit card the transaction you record transfers money from your checking account for example to the credit card account reducing the liability whatever software you choose for tracking your money i strongly recommend choosing something that is sufficiently powerful to handle representing this as i have described transfers between accounts as the normal mode of operation not simply lone increases decreases of asset accounts

capital gains tax is an income tax upon your profit from selling investments long term capital gains investments you have held for more than a year are taxed significantly less than short term gains it does n't limit how many shares you can sell it does discourage selling them too quickly after buying   you can balance losses against gains to reduce the tax due you can look for tax advantaged investments the obvious one being a 401k plan ira or equivalent though those generally require leaving the money invested until retirement but in the us most investments other than the house you are living in which some of us argue is n't really an investment are subject to capital gains tax period

first to clear up your misconceptions the balance is not merely made up of deductible and non deductible contributions   there are also earnings implied in the balance i.e. the whole reason you invest in the first place is to realize some return on investment   that return a.k.a the earnings are included in the balance of the account   the balance is the sum total of everything in the account the bottom line generally speaking basis for an account is all of the money that has been contributed deposited to the account   in the context of an ira as described in the article however they are using basis to refer to only the non deductible contributions   of note however is that basis specifically excludes earnings   if you have deposited say $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next then your basis is $ 10,000 even if the balance has grown to say $ 12,000 which includes the earnings as may be evident by now earnings are not equivalent to deductible contributions   earnings may arise from such contributions but they are not the same   rather earnings are the net positive investment results from all contributions   again if you had contributed $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next and the balance has grown to $ 12,000 then the earnings portion is $ 2000 so to interpret what happened in the specific example provided over the years the account holder contributed deposited a total of $ 15,000 into his account   these must have been non deductible contributions in the case of the ira in order to arrive at basis of $ 15,000 over time and with the deposits that $ 15,000 grew to $ 24,000 i.e. earned $ 9,000 in earnings then the nearly 50 drop caused the balance to decay to $ 13,000   this means all $ 9,000 of his earnings were wiped out plus $ 2000 of the original basis the remaining $ 13,000 is all basis that is considered to be original money deposited to the account no earnings in effect the account has lost $ 2000 of basis because $ 15,000 was deposited and only $ 13,000 remains   simplistic way of looking at it   a $ 15,000 investment resulted in a final $ 13,000 sale i.e. a net loss of $ 2000 it does n't matter that it hit $ 24,000 in the meanwhile it could have hit $ 250,000 in value and then dropped to $ 13,000 and the net result would be the same a loss of $ 2000 in basis traditional ira earnings are always tax deferred i.e. whether earnings arise from deductible or else non deductible contributions when one takes a distribution withdraws from an ira and the distribution includes earnings the earnings portion is always taxable income   does n't matter if the earnings arose from one kind of contribution or the other i do n't think in this example there were any deductible contributions whatsoever does that make sense help

there are no rules about how the price should act after an ipo so there are no guarantee that a pop would appear at the opening day but when an ipo is done it 's typically underpriced on average the shares are 10 up at the end of the first day after the ipo i do n't have the source that i just remember that from some finance course also after the ipo the underwriter can be asked to support the trading of the share for a certain period of time that is the so called stabilizing agent they have few obligations like this price support in often done by a repurchase of some of the shares of poorly performing ipo edit about the pool when the ipo is done a certain number of client buy the shares issued by the company the underwriter with the clients can decide to create an pool where the clients would get a little more shares hence but this time the shares are not issued by the company but by the underwriter to put it another way the underwriter and becomes short by a certain number of shares limited to 15 of the ipo in exchange for the risk taken by this the underwriter gets a option from the clients that will allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares at the price of the ipo from the clients the idea behind this option is to avoid a market exposure for the underwriter so after the ipo if the price goes down the underwriter buys back on the market the shares and makes a profits if the price goes up the company exercise the option buy the shares at the ipo prices the pool that is the additional shares that the clients wanted to avoid suffering a loss

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

other than the exchange risk one more thing to consider is interest rate risk and the returns you are generating from your money if it is lying around in a current account with no interest then it is rational to keep it where you intend to or aus now if your money is working for you earning interest or has been invested in the market then it seems reasonable that you should put it where it earns the maximum for you but that comes with a rider the exchange risk you may have to bear if you are converting between the currencies do the returns earned by your money cancel out the fx rates moving up and down and still leave you with a positive return compared with what you would earn if your money was where you stayed consider the below scenarios do evaluate all your options before you transfer your money

gt we 've been deficit spending for generations and we 're trillions in the hole and that 's the psychological issue hanging over our heads   let 's unpack that a bit what does trillions in the hole actually mean for the issuer of the dollar it means that the issuer at various points has to redeem its own interest bearing dollars treasuries for its own non interest bearing dollars reserves notes coins that 's not a hole that 's moving a balance from the savings account to the checking account at the same bank   you do n't think of your savings account balance as the bank being in the hole for checking account balances you implicitly understand that the bank simply marks down the number in one account and marks up the number in the other and you do n't fret that the bank might run out of checking account balances   treasuries have this same relationship to reserves not similar not analogous to but the same treasury securities are literally interest bearing accounts at the federal reserve reserves are literally demand accounts at the federal reserve when a treasury matures a treasury securities account is marked down a reserve account is marked up when a treasury is issued a treasury securities account is marked up and a reserve account is marked down   what you 're thinking of as trillions in the hole is just trillions in a savings account balance   that 's what it means to have debt in a currency that you are the issuer of and why foreign denominated debt is fundamentally different   gt;so we can design a system that will keep inflation low while we dump money into the economy   we already have that there 's no inflation monster under the bed if there 's an inflation problem it 's that we 're so paranoid about it we 're not putting enough money into the economy and so unnecessary misery on ourselves   gt the issue in my mind with dumping money while the debt situation is such a concern is that speculators could the bed and devalue our currency   there 's nothing a speculator can do vs a sovereign currency that the issuing central bank ca n't offset so if you are a sovereign and the issuing central bank is within and beneath your authority you have the last word and there 's no such thing as bond   in contrast if you take on sovereign obligations denominated in currencies where the issuing central bank sits outside your authority as is the case when you borrow peg to foreign currency or enter a monetary union like the euro you become just another currency user here your government actually is kinda like a household and can go broke in that foreign   consider how that perspective sheds light on the mystery of why some countries actually experience a debt crisis and others do n't why contrary to all the someplace like japan for example can have 200 debt gdp and near zero interest rates and no sovereign debt crisis it 's because japan issues the yen sets the interest rate on the yen and ca n't run out of yen   people who do n't understand this are what gave the hedge funds feeling confident about the trade in 12 its name time after time they line up to place bets on japanese government bond crisis they 're always wrong and always will be

there are two or three issues here one is how quickly can you get cash out of your investments if you had an unexpected expense if you suddenly needed more cash than you have on hand how long would it take to get money out of your scott trade account or wherever it is i have a td ameritrade account which is pretty similar and it just takes a couple of days to get money out i 'm hard pressed to think of a time when i literally needed a bunch of cash today with no advance warning what sudden bills is one likely to have a medical bill perhaps but hey just a few weeks ago i had to go to the emergency room with a medical problem and it 's not like they demanded cash on the table before they 'd help me i just got the bill maybe 3 weeks after the event i 've never decided to move and then actually moved 2 days later these things take some planning etc second how much risk are you willing to tolerate if you have your money in the stock market the market could go down just as you need the cash that 's not even a worst case scenario extreme scenario after all if the economy gets bad the stock market could go down and the same fact could result in your employer laying you off that said you could reduce this risk by keeping some of your money in a low risk investment like some high quality bonds third you want to have cash to cover the more modest routine expenses like make sure you always have enough cash on hand to pay the rent or mortgage buy food and so on and fourth you want to keep a cushion against bookkeeping mistakes i 've had twice in my life that i 've overdrawn a checking account not because i was broke but because i messed up my records and thought i had more money in the account than i really did it 's impossible to give exact numbers without knowing a lot about your income and expenses but for myself i keep a cushion of $ 1,000 to $ in my checking account on top of all regular bills that i know i 'll have to pay in the next month to cover modest unexpected expenses and mistakes i pay most of my bills by credit card for convenience pay the balance in full when i get the bill so i do n't pay interest so i do n't need a lot of cushion i used to keep 2 to 3 months pay in an account invested in bonds and very safe stocks something that would n't lose much value even in bad times since my daughter started college i 've run this down to less than 1 months pay and instead of replacing that money i 'm instead putting my spare money into more general stocks which is admittedly riskier so between the two accounts i have a little over 2 months pay which i think is low but as i say i 'm trying to get my kids through college so i 've run down my savings some i think if i had more than 6 months pay in easily liquidated assets then unless i expected to need a bunch of cash for something buying a new house or some such i 'd be transferring that to a retirement account with tax advantages

well this relates to how you interpret something 's value we can use that magazine and restaurant as an example for you the extra $ more on a decent meal or wine is worth it while $ 5 for a magazine entertainment on a train ride might not be this is how all markets work people make decisions about how they value something and hence choose to spend or not if you 're asking should i value certain things the way i do well that 's a different story   e.g. should i keep that picture frame for years in the attic to sell it for $ 3 on ebay later probably not worth it but again you are making that decision based on how you choose to value it so to answer your question how can i possibly care about this when my stock portfolio is losing or gaining $ 1000 a day and is it normal yes it is normal and we all care everyone makes these decisions throughout each day people will vary as to what they value something to be but all in all everyone does just what you explained here is something that you may find interesting it is about how we value money what color is your money if the pdf does n't work for you then try this link what color is your money alt link

the preapproval is the bank stating that they will loan you up to a with a down payment of b for y years at r rate if you do n't ned all the money that is great they will still give you the loan you can keep the down payment some amount of money or the same percentage of the purchase price whichever you want for example preapproval of $ 200,000 and a down payment of $ 50,000 20   allows you to buy a house for $ 250,000 but you find one for $ 240,000 you can either neither of these needs a new pre approval in both cases your monthly payment will be lower than the original loan was expected to be if you want to change to $ 200 k for the loan and $ 40 k for the down payment or in other words decrease the percentage of down payment you might run into an issue that the bank does n't think you have enough of your own money in the deal or you may now require pmi where you did n't previously in this case they will need to re approve you now if the price goes up the bank could require more money down or may need to re evaluate the loan

i strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by january 15 2014 you will receive forms 1099-misc from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you a copy will go to the irs also you file a schedule c with your form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-misc forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than $ 600 for which a 1099-misc does not need to be issued or tips say if you are a taxi driver running your own cab and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income including tools books or gasoline etc that you bought for doing the job you will need to file a schedule se that will compute how much you owe in social security and medicare taxes on the net income on schedule c. you will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee 's share but also the employer 's share at least you will not have to pay income tax on the employer 's share your net income on schedule c will transfer onto form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe and then add on the social security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid you will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013 plus   interest on the tax paid late   send the irs a check for the total if you talk to an accountant right away he she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe and sending in that amount by january 15 will save some money the accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above

yes the s corp can deduct up to the amount it actually incurred in expenses if your actual expenses to build the were $ 1000 then the $ 1000 would be deductible and your business should be able to show $ 1000 in receipts or inventory changes note you can not deduct beyond your actual expenses even if you would normally charge more for example suppose you invoiced the non profit $ 2000 for the and once the bill was paid you turned around and donated the $ 2000 back to the non profit in that case you would be deducting $ 1000 for your cost + $ 2000 donation for a total of $ 3000 but you also would have $ 2000 in income so in the end you would end up with a $ 1000 loss which is exactly what your expenses were to begin with it would probably be a good idea to be able to explain why you did this for free if somehow you personally benefit from it then it could possibly be considered income to you similar to if you bought a tv for your home with company funds it would probably be cleaner from an accounting perspective if you followed through as described invoice the non profit and then donate the payment back to them though not necessary it could lesson any doubt about your motives

they immediately make money by charging you the initial fee   in the long term they make money because a surprisingly large number of customers do n't pay the balance off or otherwise violate the terms of the offer so that the rate applies    and sometimes depending on card policies they make money when the consumer makes new purchases on the card which accrue interest immediately at the rate while payments only go to paying down the 0 rate balance

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

i think you can do it as long as those money do n't come from illegal activities money laundering etc the only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the uk bank account since i suppose you already paid taxes on those money in greece while you were earning those money about being audited in my own experience banks do n't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them they are very willing to help and happy it 's a story when you ask to borrow money when i opened a bank account in us i did not even have an ssn but they did n't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account obviously on the interest generated by the money in the us bank account i had to pay taxes but it was easy because i simply let the irs via the bank to the 27 on the interest generated not on the capital deposited i did n't put a huge amount of money there i had to live there for 1 year or some more maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did i make all those money but those money were legally generated by me working in italy before so i did n't have anything to be afraid about btw in italy i was thinking to move money to a german bank in germany the risk of default is a nightmare something of new now in compared to the past where each state had its own currency according to muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts yes historically governments have    shut down banks to prevent people from    withdrawing their money in times of    crisis see argentina circa 2001 or us    during great depression the    government prevented people from    withdrawing their money and people    could do nothing while their money    rapidly lost value but in case greece prevents people from money those money are still in euro so i 'm wondering what would be the effect i mean would it be fair that a greek guy can not withdraw is euro money an italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in italy

the fund should be reporting returns net of expenses so your interpretation is right it made something like which sounds plausible based on current yields on short term securities and the 0.05 is what 's left after expenses i 've never seen a regular mutual fund report raw returns before expenses   if one does the my personal opinion would be that they 're trying to you as that number is n't actually representative of anybody 's actual returns    if you look carefully you should be able to find a table that reports several kinds of adjusted returns for the fund as to what happens if a fund ca n't earn enough returns to cover its expenses in that case the value of the fund shares will decrease   this happens from time to time with riskier funds   it should n't happen with a money market fund because both the returns and the expenses are fairly predictable so the fund managers should be able to avoid it unless they get caught up in a major crisis like the 2008 banking crisis   in ordinary times a money market fund managers who could n't keep expenses below income would find themselves looking for a new job fairly quickly finally for what it 's worth is a really high expense ratio for a money market fund   if you were to shop around you could easily find comparable funds with expenses less than half that

vesting as you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price   actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option   your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares the other have conditions attached the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future   when the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares dividends arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners i.e. the shareholders by selling goods and/or services at a profit   how does that money actually get to the shareholders   there are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one   periodically potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend   every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held so for example in 4 years or so after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company   if the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $ 20,000   depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this those are the basic concepts as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur but that 's hopefully enough to get you started

there 's two scenarios the loan accrues interest on the remaining balance or the total interest was computed ahead of time and your payments were averaged over x years so your payments are always the same the second scenarios is better for the bank so guess what you probably have in the first scenario i would pay it off to avoid paying interest unless there is a compelling reason to keep the cash available for something else and you do n't mind paying interest in the second case you 're going to pay interest over x years as computed when you bought the car no matter how quickly you pay it off so take your time if you pay it earlier it 's like paying interest that would not have actually accrued since you 're paying it off faster than necessary if you pay it off i 'm not sure if it would close the account your credit history might show the account as being paid which is a good thing

i took a second mortgage when i moved house because i had a long term fixed rate mortgage that would have incurred punitive fees if i had cancelled it rather than doing that i took a second mortgage over the same term for the difference as my second mortgage was with the same lender they still had first charge on the property this means that in the event of default they have first call on the property to recoup their losses so the interest rate was not higher actually it was slightly less than my first mortgage my case is not that usual normally a second mortgage is with a separate provider that takes a second charge on the property the interest rates are normally higher as a result as there is more chance that the lender will not recoup their money in case of a default as the first charge has priority the second mortgage may still be cheaper than an unsecured loan as the second charge provides some collateral this might make it attractive if a sudden expense needs to be covered

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt

gt i have a bachelor 's degree in management but for the most part we skimmed through several finance related subjects like investments project analysis   i wish i could flag the question of why do they do this to you kids for future discussion with those more knowledgable because surely there are incentives shaping these programs   however you asked for assistance so i will share the limited knowledge that i have   from the other advice it seems clear that you should absolutely pursue a stronger background in accounting and finance in order to accomplish your long term goals   this work will need to extend past the point of this particular interview whether you are hired by this company or not   so you should probably approach that as a concurrent educational goal rather than tying it to your preparations for this interview per se   with regards to seeming smart per se   do n't sweat it too much   if you 're qualified for the job without a certified educational background then it 's not a position where relative intelligence short of frame breaking brilliance is going to be decisive   past the point where your prospective competence is established other factors will quickly it   attempting to impress people with intelligence rather than concrete achievements should by rights serve as a red flag for prospective employers   intelligence its own set of liabilities and deficiencies   the world is full of intelligent people who would rather be measured by what they could have achieved rather than what they did achieve   if attempting to be hired for this job involves a fully transparent approach that is the company would be interested in knowingly hiring someone with an incomplete background    in the work they will eventually be expected to perform then your ability to prepare for the interview is a significant part of your   low hanging fruit nonetheless easily missed are histories of the industry the technology and the particular company

the thing about the swiss banks is that the accounts there were anonymous that 's why it 's such a famous example until not so long ago the access to the account was by a password and no one knew whose account it is and to whom the money belongs that 's perfect for money laundering and various illegal activities like hiding bribe money stolen money evading taxes and what not the us pressured swiss to cancel that policy and now the swiss banks are basically the same as everywhere else there are other off shore places that still allow similar anonymous accounts i think having an account abroad is usually legal depends on the country of your citizenship of course i think in canada there 's no law against that certainly not in the us as long as you declare everything and the owners of the accounts are not anonymous and their id 's were verified by the bank by the way one of the former israeli prime ministers had to resign his post because journalists found out that his wife had a bank account in the us in that time late 1970 's it was illegal for israeli citizens to have accounts in foreign banks similar laws were in the ussr and most if not all of the eastern block all of these countries no longer forbid foreign bank accounts

first make sure you are contacting the bank directly use an old invoice you have on hand with a phone number direct to the bank and call them   do not use the provided number or you may wind up being pulled into a scam it is entirely possible that the bank is also confused at this point so you should not rely on the number provided at all second once you can confirm that your account is being closed find out when it is being closed so you know when you need to act on it it 's possible you still have access to your account and do not need to launch into a panic just yet    third get the bank to explain exactly why they are closing your account make it clear that if they can not explain you will be forced to transfer to a new account and close business with them permanently this is not a threat this is a matter of fact because finally if you can not keep your account open find a different bank and open up a new account   frankly if your current bank is closing your account and only managed to get a letter out to you a month late you should probably find a new bank   if instead they simply can not figure out if your bank account is closed or not this is also a bad sign and you may want a new bank account anyway    but please go through these steps in order because you need to verify with your bank what is going on    keep 's answer in mind as well in case you need to get your money out of your account quickly

there is the opportunity cost   let 's say it cost you $ 1000 to buy 0.25 discount over n number of years that saves you let 's say $ 2000 thus your profit is $ 1000 what if you took that $ 1000 and invested it would you have more than $ 2000 after n number of   years obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses for example you can compare the return you 'll likely get from investing in cd or treasury bond a bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5 10 year period   for example if your loan is $ 200,000 at 0.25 per year you 'll get $ 500 in savings over 10 years that 's $ 5000 $ 1000 to buy the point you end up with $ 4000   using the calculator on this site i calculated that if you invested in the dow jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017   you total return would have been 111 assuming dividends are reinvested or you would've had a total of $   i 'm not sure how accurate those numbers are but it seems likely that buying points is a pretty good investment if you stay in the house for 10 years or more

depending on where you live in the uk buying a house sooner might be a better option i would echo the advice about putting some money away into a rainy day fund etc above but i know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7 per year i bought a house two years ago and i 'm paying 4 interest on my mortgage so i 'm effectively making money by owning my house   given that you want to buy a house if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest you 're effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices meaning you 'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £ 4k in lawyers fees surveys mortgage setup fees etc and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a of the sale cost if you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. london where house prices are currently skyrocketing if you do n't want to live in the house you may be able to do a buy to let as an investment generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent property management company 's fees so while you wo n't see any actual net income the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you 'll be building equity on the home it 's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

in addition to all the good information that joetaxpayer has provided be aware of this when you sell mutual fund shares you can if you choose to do so tell the mutual fund company which shares you want to sell e.g. all shares purchased on xx plus 10 shares out of shares purchased on ss plus and pay taxes on the gains losses on those specific shares if you do not specify which shares you want sold the mutual fund company will tell you the gains losses based on the average cost basis and you can use this information if you like note that some of your gains losses will be   short term gains or losses if you use the average cost basis or you can use the fifo method usually resulting in the largest gain in which the shares are sold in the order in which they were purchased this usually results in no short term gains losses just so that you know most mutual fund companies will link your checking account in your bank to your account with them a one time paperwork deal is necessary in which your bank manager 's signature is required on the authorization to be sent to the fund company after that the   connection is nearly as seamless as with your current system tell the fund company you want to invest money in a certain mutual fund and to take the money from your linked checking account and they will take care of it   sell some shares and they will deposit the money into your linked bank account and so on   the mutual fund company will not accept instructions from you or someone to be you to sell shares and to send the money to joe blow or to joe taxpayer for that matter the proceeds of redemptions go to your checking account or are used to buy shares in other mutual funds offered by the company called an exchange and not a redemption oh and most fund companies offer automatic investments as well as automatic redemptions at fixed time intervals just as with your bank

tax concerns aside there are managerial pros and cons for internal billing   for cost control purposes it 's common to break individual business activities into divisions sections which have a p&amp;l or are cost centers at that point if you know for example that your quality control inspections cost on average 1 of your product cost then one might bill internally for use of this cost center   one argument for doing this is it makes those who are billed more cautious about using internal resources as there 's a direct cost allocation it also benchmarks that resource against for example it may be significantly cheaper to use an external resource there can therefore be a healthy tension between the cost center and user which in theory results in pressure for the cost center to improve efficiency    in practice i 've found there are some significant cons first issue is with cost allocation the cost center in an attempt to make their service appear more efficient will battle to get minimal overhead costs allocated to them creating friction between departments second and i think a major issue is a blanket cost for use of a service invariably winds up with a lot of exceptions in the previous example there may be some very large programs where a 1 inspection fee winds up with a huge sum of money one that the product team may argue unfairly reduces their net income and therefore compensation then there 's the administrative cost of what essentially is passing money from the left hand to the right even if just on paper third issue is with some activities you might not want to provide a disincentive for people to use the for example charging a product team for quality assurance may result in skipped qa processes for the benefit of cost savings   what i 've found works better is creation of cost centers with management of those centers this is common in companies that have a matrix organizational structure using the same example again qa costs are broken out and completely separated from other areas and qa management is independently

gt the best teachers make hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in private educational institutions   1 i am sure some teachers do and that these teachers are far better than average but teacher pay correlates with a lot of other things like seniority    2 education is not just one thing and it is sometimes closer to a private good and sometimes closer to a public wiki education as status is a private good which is why private schools can afford to pay prestige bringing teachers a lot of money education as human capital is in some cases also a private good e.g. most of the benefits for graduate business education accrues to the student so externalities are negligible but in other cases it is probably not e.g. it 's better for everyone if everyone else is literate and so there are externalities involved in basic education and civic education is an almost public good the benefits of voting only exist if many people do it and they are spread largely evenly throughout society   right now the government has a hand in funding all of these this may or may not be a good idea whether from the standpoint of pure efficiency or from the taxation is theft   but in your opinion which of the above educations could plausibly be funded adequately without taxation   edit fixed link

companies theoretically have an infinite number of equity units at their disposal   issuance must be approved according to its founding contracts if an equity is trading on an open market then the price of each unit issued in lieu of cash compensation is known   even if an equity does n't trade openly bidders can be solicited for a possible price or an appraisal   this can be a risky route for the potentially compensated market are frequently generally approximately equal to the sales of a company   salaries and wages are frequently generally two thirds of sales it is indeed expensive for the average company to compensate with equity thus so few do usually restricting equity compensation to executives and exceptional laborers   besides they frequently have enough cash to pay for compensation avoiding transaction costs for companies in growth industries such as technology or medicine their situations are usually reversed cash constrained yet equity abundant because of large investment and dearly priced equities   for a company trading at a market capitalization multiplied by forty times the revenue compensating with equity is inexpensive

you can pontificate about how life is so hard for her because shit costs money and you 're right she ca n't support herself and kids however that does n't change the basic economic reality that working full time at simply does not provide enough value to her employer and there are two many people with her very low skill set that she can not command a higher wage no amount of government programs will change that robbing the tax payers through welfare killing businesses and destroying jobs by imposing a wage that simply is is counter productive unsustainable and simply misguided do n't believe me ask the university of washington who have the numbers on seattle 's ever escalating minimum wage and the effect on jobs this is of course assuming you care that people are being put out of work so a few can be paid a living wage welfare is an endless tap of free money right     the irony of your oh so well cited comment is that you did n't apply it to your own proposed solution of a minimum wage increase jobs and labor report higher fast food wages higher fast food prices a great analysis of effect of this change on consumer prices how it affects the capital side of the equation of whether to operate a restaurant at all and how a higher minimum wage impairs the creation of entry level jobs     succinctly minimum wage jobs were never meant to be able to support a family of three no matter how much you wish it could by creating artificially higher wages you 'll get higher unemployment more substitution of labor with more capital intensive solutions ordering kiosks etc and higher taxes and consumer prices    edit link   edit 2 trigger warning also it 's a lot easier to raise kids with two working parents that 's just math for you talk about a bad personal choice that no one has touched on poor kids

ditto but let me add a couple of comments but more mentioned transaction costs yes many tax shelters require setting up accounts doing paperwork etc often you have to get a lawyer or accountant to do this right if the tax shelter could save you $ 1 million a year in taxes it makes sense to pay a lawyer $ 10,000 to set it up right if it could save you $ 100 a year in taxes paying $ 10,000 to set it up would be foolish in some cases the tax savings would be so small that it would n't be worth the investment of spending $ 20 on a fedex package to ship the paperwork inconvenience arguably this is a special case of transaction costs the cost of your time suppose i knew that a certain tax shelter would save me $ 100 a year in taxes but it would take me 20 hours a year to do the paperwork or whatever to manage it i probably would n't bother because my free time is worth more than $ 5 an hour to me if the payoff was bigger or if i was poorer i might be willing complexity perhaps a special case of 3 if the rules to manage the tax shelter are complicated it may not be worth the trouble you have to spend a bunch of time and if you do it wrong you may get audited and slapped with fines and penalties even if you do it right a shelter might increase your chance of being audited and thus create uncertainty and anxiety i 've never intentionally cheated on my taxes but every year when i do my taxes i worry what if i make an honest mistake but the government decides that it 's attempted fraud and nails me to the wall qualification again as others have noted tax shelters are n't generally if you fill out this form and check box d you get 50 off on your taxes the shelters exist because the government decided that it would be unfair to impose taxes in this particular situation or that giving a tax break encourages investment or some other worthy goal sometimes that worthy goal is pay off my campaign contributors but that 's another subject the rules may have unintended loopholes but any truly gaping ones tend to get plugged so if say they say that you get a special tax break for investing in medical research you ca n't just declare that your cigarette and whiskey purchases are medical research and claim the tax break or you talked about off shore tax havens the idea here is that the us government can not tax income earned in another country and that has never even entered the us if you make $ 10 in france and deposit it in a french bank account and spend it in france the us ca n't tax that so american companies sometimes set up bank accounts outside the us to hold income earned outside the us so they do n't have to bring it into the us and pay the high us tax rate us corporate taxes are now the highest of any industrialized country you could i suppose open an account in the caymans and deposit the income you earned from your us job there but if the money was earned in the us working at a factory or office in the us   by a person living in the us the irs is not going to accept that this is foreign income

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

a sunk cost is a cost that you have already incurred and wo n't get back the sunk cost fallacy as you described is when you make a bad decision based on your sunk cost   when you identify a sunk cost you realize that the money has been spent and the decision is irreversible   future decisions should not take this cost into account   when you commit the sunk cost fallacy you are keeping something that is bad simply because you spent a lot of money on it   you are failing to identify the correct current value of something based on its high cost to you in the past the other fallacy you describe the opposite of the sunk cost fallacy is when you get rid of something that is good simply because you spent little on it   as before you are also failing to correctly identify the correct current value of something but in this case you are assigning too little a value based on the low cost in the past   you could call this a type of opportunity cost a loss of future benefits due to a mistake made today   it seems reasonable to describe this type of fallacy as an opportunity cost fallacy

a lot sometimes called a round lot always refers to the quantity of physical good that you 're getting like a of eggs or a barrel of oil   the tricky thing in the case of forex is that the physical good also happens to be a currency a spot currency product trades in the denomination on the right hand side of the product name   so if you 're buying eur usd you are paying usd currency to get eur units and if you 're selling eur usd you are receiving usd by giving away eur units   the eur is the physical good in this case the way i remember it is to think of all products not just currencies as trading pairs   so aapl in my mind is aapl usd   when i buy aapl usd i am paying usd to get aapl units   when i sell aapl usd i am receiving usd by giving away aapl units the thing on the left is the physical good even if it happens to be money that you are exchanging and the thing on the right is the money that you are exchanging so when i buy a lot of aapl i am buying 100 shares at their current price in dollars similarly when i buy a lot of eur usd i am buying 100 k euros at their current price in dollars

this article is silly   we have a functioning labor market wages are balanced by supply and demand   we do n't need more regulation to fix it   i think the market is effectively   you have skilled jobs being well paid and candidates can easily switch   for instance entry level computer science grads regularly make $ 60k and have multiple offers   if you 're highly skilled life is good economically   i think the jobs that require trade skills are also under supplied   the roofer in the article is an example   these folks also get reasonable pay and steady work certainly enough for a middle class lifestyle   if you 're a low skill worker then life is much harder   there are job shortages wages are low and employees suffer   one complication is that many students go to college but graduate without marketable skills   this leaves them to compete against low skill workers   so college grads suffer from low wages and non college grads suffer from increased competition i 'm surprised so many people still take on college debt to get degrees that offer little to no wage premium   minimum wage hikes can help a little   in seattle they found no job loss from the first small minimum wage hike and an increase in employee well being   the second hike was larger and created significant job losses enough that total wages paid were flat   i think this means that some jobs do n't generate enough value to be paid $ 15/hr   the tl dr is get skills to lead an easier economic life

first off with startups forget that you know about common structures of debt and equity just try to think of this money as a generic investment that meets the investors risk and return objectives   startups are unique in that they are high risk but generally have almost no assets or security for an investor investors generically want two things 1 return and 2 limited risk    without speculating too much consider that the investor might be viewing the return component as the 30 equity and the 8 dividend and he views the risk management component as the additional 30 equity until repaid   a different way of looking at this might be that the investor would require an equity stake greater than 30 with greater than a 8 dividend if he did not get the initial investment back in return for the reduced stake   in other words this structure is debt and equity because that is what the investor can demand   maybe you can get around this by offering a higher equity stake or offering something else although this structure is common because it aligns interests of the investor and the startup

actually that statistic whether it is 9/10 or 95 or 99 is often very and it is both overstated and extremely misleading   first of all the ratio percentage of even the urban myth that everyone knows is purportedly over a 5 year period of time not a single year   secondly just because a business has closed down or ceased to exist sometime prior to the 5 year mark does not necessarily mean that it was a failure and definitely not necessarily a bankruptcy   third it does not mean that all of the initial investment went poof that may be true for high tech startups especially the dot com dot bomb con operations whose business plan resembles the south park wikipedia en d dd more than anything else but that is not necessarily true of the rest of the business world   consider by contrast how many employees are still in the same job five years later per data the average job tenure in the us is now 4.6 story americans less likely to change jobs now than 01 10 which is actually up from 3.7 years in 2002 and 3.5 years in circa 1983   the vast majority of small businesses and the sheer skews the totals are essentially that they are job replacement or even job supplement businesses which chiefly consist of the owner operator being self employed or part time self employed on the side for a year two years and possibly longer   occasionally they will then often temporarily employ others as well but the primary goal is to provide a simple income for the owner operator   and there is nothing wrong with that   nor is there anything wrong with the person then ending that business and moving on to another different name different field business or taking a job with some company which they may have previously worked for on a contract basis with the business etc   the idea that all businesses somehow should endure forever and continue to grow forever as if they were all destined to be giant trees is actually rather warped and delusional it ignores the real world and the fact that most is not giant trees but rather small and plants and for small businesses being nimble and profitable often means the opposite knowing when to get out of a market or business is just as important indeed can be more important than knowing when to get into it   as a further note on the volume you have to also add in the large number of business ideas that an llc but then went nowhere companies especially these days when starting an llc in many states is simply filling out a form online and paying a filing fee iow the business may have had a temporary legal existence name probably a reserved domain name maybe even a logo etc but when it comes to reality actual investment in assets and conducting business operations of any type well a lot of the horses never even make it past the gate and that too skews the numbers in many studies     note that here is another take on the point     gt;as far as we can tell there is no statistical basis for the assertion that nine out of 10 businesses fail it appears to be one of those nonsense facts that people repeat without thinking too clearly about it here are some basic questions to ask when assessing such a   gt;1 what ’s the time frame two years five years 10 years that can make a big difference does fail mean that it goes out of business because it was not financially viable or does that also include data about successful enterprises that merge with another company would n’t failure rates be different for some industries than others does it make sense to lump all businesses together   gt;there have been a number of studies that have looked at this issue this chart from web site designer summarizes the results of three different studies basically after four years 50 percent of the businesses are open as time goes on the success rate decreases but it never gets to a failure rate of nine out of 10   gt   gt;even this does not show the whole picture as brian an economist at the small business administration demonstrated in a 2002 study for small business economics about one third of closed business were actually successful when they failed   significant proportion of businesses that closed while successful calls into question the use of business as a meaningful measure of business outcome the study says it appears that many owners may have executed a planned exit strategy closed a business without excess debt sold a viable business or retired from the work force   now that does n't necessarily mean that rand paul 's point is wrong he is chiefly talking about government investing in highly leveraged high risk high tech businesses which are a different story but it does mean that the statistic he is citing general business failure rate is an urban myth however commonly believed or commonly restated

there are other good answers to the general point that the essence of what you 're describing exists already but i 'd like to point out a separate flaw in your logic why add more complications so that should i call this principal or interest actually makes a difference why 's the point incentive for this the incentive is that using excess payments to credit payments due in the future rather than applying it to outstanding principal is more lucrative for the lender since it 's more lucrative and there 's no law against it most all lenders use it as the default setting

it 's an effective way to achieve market segmentation without having to ask your customers how rich they are and you get the benefit of finding out additional information like their address email etc the principle is similar to coupons on cereal boxes anybody can get the rebate discount if they go to the effort but people who are cash rich time poor are less likely to do so than those that really need the money joel wrote about this and various other pricing mechanisms a while back i like to reference the article every few weeks it 's well worth a read now if you 're retired and living off of social security $ 7 an hour sounds pretty good so you do it but if you 're a stock analyst at merrill lynch getting paid $ a year to say nice things about piece of junk internet companies working for $ 7 an hour is a joke and you 're not going to clip coupons heck in one hour you could issue buy recommendations on ten piece of junk internet companies so coupons are a way for consumer products companies to charge two different prices and effectively segment their market into two mail in rebates are pretty much the same as coupons with some other like the fact that they reveal your address so you can be direct marketed to in the future

i 've thought that it was strange but the price that gets quoted on a stock exchange is just the price of the last transaction the irony of this definition of price is that there may not actually be any more shares available on the market at that price it 's also strange to me that the price is n't adjusted at all for the size of the transaction a transaction of just 1 share will post a new price even if just seconds earlier 100,000 shares traded for a different price ok unrealistic example but you get my point i 've always believed this is an odd way to describe the price anyway my here is supposed to illustrate the point that the fluctuations you see in price do n't really reflect changing valuations by the stock owning public each post in the exchange maintains a book of orders with unmatched buy orders on one side and unmatched sell orders on the other side if you go to your broker and tell him fill my order for 50,000 shares at market price then the broker wo n't fill you 50,000 shares at .20 instead he 'll buy the 50 .22 then 80 then 100 .30 etc because your order is so large compared to the unmatched orders your market order will get matched a bunch of the unmatched orders on the sell side and each match will notch the posted price up a bit if instead you asked the broker open a limit order to buy 50000 shares at .20 then the exchange will add your order to the book in this case your order likely wo n't get filled at all since nobody at the moment wants to sell at .20 and historically speaking it 's unlikely that such a seller will suddenly appear filling large orders is actually a common problem for institutional investors written by a professor i had in school

the rounding should always follow the same rule if the value ends in .01 or .02 then you round to does n't matter if it 's 10.01 rounding to 10.00 or 0.01 to 0.00 the decision on what a company wants to do if an invoice total is $ 0.01 or $ 0.02 would be up to the company the pos system should follow the rule and round to $ 0.00 if the method of payment is cash but the company has the right to not give things away for free   they can impose a minimum cash invoice amount of $ 0.05 but you would do this by requiring the customer to add more items to their purchase you could n't just round the invoice up to $ 0.05 and to charge them $ 0.05 for a $ 0.01 item it would be similar to companies having a minimum purchase amount when paying by credit card if their minimum amount is $ 10.00 and you want to buy something that 's $ 5.00 you either pay cash or add something to your order they do n't just charge you $ 10.00 for your $ 5.00 item i think this would be a extreme edge case where you have an invoice with a total of $ 0.01 or $ 0.02 without any discounts partial payments etc if the customer 's total was $ 10.01 and they paid with a $ 10.00 gift card the final amount owing of $ 0.01 would round down to $ 0.00 and they would n't owe any more if they had paid cash the total would have rounded to $ 10.00 anyway   similarly if the customer returned an item and bought a new item or used coupons and the total owing was $ 0.01 or $ 0.02 then you would round down to $ 0.00 and they would n't pay anything as said you can implement some options to allow the company to decide how they want to handle this you could have an option that does n't allow a sale to be processed if the total amount is less than $ 0.03 and the sale does n't include any discounts returned items coupons etc the option could be to completely block the sale require a supervisor override or just display a warning to the cashier best bet is to talk to as many of your current or potential clients as you can to see how they would like this edge case handled for many it 's probably a mute case since they would n't have items that have a unit price less than $ 0.03 maybe a place like a hardware store that sells individual nuts bolts and washers

if you are living together casually no formal partnership agreement then my option would be to ask her politely to as she has offered make a contribution   by buying the groceries or some such which you share a voluntary contribution not an enforceable one just as between flat mates where only one is the actual tenant of the flat but the tenancy allows sharing check your tenancy allows you to share ps an old saying is never do business with close family i.e do not charge your wife or living in partner rent it mixes emotional domestic life with a formal business life which can set going in case of a break up or dispute if you enter into child bearing relationship or parent hood or formal partnership or marriage then all this changes at some time in the future

just saying i 'm not a big earner but i was able to live quite comfortably on one income with my g f and our girl we had a cheap rent house was n't modern but central heating + warm water + clean is all one needs right and we did n't have a car so no big payments on that i 'm belgian as well btw   we were able to live a very good life without having to cut back on food or drink i used to go out once a week even   but well we did n't have a tv and no twice a year going to spain or anywhere on holiday we 'd take the train to go to the belgian coast or the zoo or whatever as said no car but everything we needed was either in walking distance or public transport or bike no car = lots of cash that would go to gas insurance taxes otherwise but even with the one income 1500 1800 euro after taxes per month depending on how many we lived a nice life i smoked still do without we saved a little each month my little girl never lacked anything she could ever want not even toys which are n't exactly a necessity    now that my g f works as well we were able to buy a nice house and we 're able to save most of what she earns    tl;dr living on one income is possible you just need to sacrifice some things you do n't really need or be lucky

personally i would have a hard time locking up the money for that very little return   i would probably rather earn no interest in favor of the liquidity however you should find out what the early removal penalties are   if those are minimal and you are very confident that you will not need the money over the term period then its definitely better to earn something rather than nothing if inflation is negative you are n't out as much not getting any interest as you would be normally consider that in 2014 us inflation was 0.8   online liquid savings accounts pay about 1   so that 's only .2 positive   in comparison at you are better off with no interest than a us person putting their money in a paying savings account   keep in mind though that inflation can change month to month so just because june was negative does n't mean the year will be that way not sure your ability to invest in the us market or what stable dividend payers may exist in sweden you said you are risk averse but it may be worth it to find a stable dividend paying fund   i like one called it pays a monthly dividend of 6 and over 5 years stock price is very stable   of course this is quite a significant jump in risk because you can lose money if markets tank is down over 10 years quite a bit   maybe splitting up the money and diversifying

i think this thread got a bit off topic   the point is that we 've decided as a nation that we want to guarantee a basic level of healthcare as established by government programs   companies like wal mart take advantage of that paying low wages and assuming employees will utilize the government assistance   the take away is that that 's a little goofy and we should just fix our fucking healthcare system   as for wal mart   it 's complicated   they 've accomplished huge gains in efficiency arguably accomplishing more for the environment than any other company not to mention their moves towards sustainable fish etc   at the same time the lawsuit alleging gender discrimination seemed not without merit the folks in charge are occasionally aggressively socially conservative and their march to the bottom for prices has induced quality suppliers to provide lower quality products specifically to be sold in wal mart their brand name and their products after being suckered in by the big sales numbers

you 're asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive expected value ev the short answer is no there 's an interesting article that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs the key point even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers as more tickets are purchased and the jackpot grows larger the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your ev goes down the article concludes it paints a picture for anyone    still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an    economically rational investment as the jackpot grows in value the    number of people who try to win it grows super linearly this human    behavior has a mathematical consequence even though the jackpot    itself can theoretically grow without bound there is a point at which    the ticket buying grows to such a fever pitch that the    expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again

in most cases a debit card can be charged like a credit card so there is typically no strict need for a credit card however a debit card provides weaker guarantees to the merchant that an arbitrary amount of money will be available this is for several reasons as such there are a few situations where a credit card is required for example amazon requires a credit card for prime membership and car rental companies usually require a credit card the following does not apply to the op and is provided for reference debit cards do n't build credit so if you 've never had a credit card or loan before you 'll likely have no credit history at all if you 've never had a credit card this will make it very difficult to get any sized loan also some employers typically if the job you 're applying for involves financial or other highly sensitive information check credit when hiring and not having credit puts you at a disadvantage

on a summary level there are three conceptual ways of clearing money electronically immediate clearing where banks often but not necessarily with support of the supervisory entities send immediate drawing rights against their own cash reserves and dedicate this right to the account of the receiving customer this is rather expensive as it limits the banks ability to use their cash reserves for their own banking operations crediting etc this is often the only way to wire significant in comparison to the bank size amounts of money   internal clearing where the money actually never leaves the bank it 's just moved between accounts of two different customers of the same bank it 's usually free as the bank is still free to use your money to do it 's banking and it 's usually immediate since nothing actually needs to happen besides a change in the banks entries   batch clearing where banks submit outstanding requests against each other and calculate the net settlement basically when you from bank a wire money to me in bank b there is a high chance that a similar amount of money is wired between two other users it the opposite direction after a bit of accounting the net imbalance is computed and often drawn via immediate clearing but the bulk of the money actually never leaves any of the banks it just is between each banks customers as per agreed books   there are also additional ways where companies decide to open accounts in each of the banks and provide some sort of immediate clearing backed by the operators cash reserves rather than the banks and so on how does it happen in indonesia i have no idea but i think a good overview of how it happens around the world is a publication by a partner entity of ours if you are really curious i 'd research under what legal form does paypal indonesia operate it should be somewhere in the archives and figure out what other wiring options are available

if this is n't a case where you would be willing to forgive the debt if they ca n't pay it 's a business transaction not a friend transaction establish exactly what the interest rate will be what the term of the loan is whether periodic payments are required how much is covered by those payments vs. being due at the end of the term as a balloon payment whether they can make additional payments to reduce the principal early get it all in writing and signed by all concerned before any money changes hands consider having a lawyer review the language before signing if the loan is large enough that it might incur gift taxes then you may want to go the extra distance to make it a real properly documented intra family loan to do this you must charge of at least pay taxes on at least a certain minimal interest rate and they have to make regular payments or you can gift them the payments but you still wo n't up paying tax on the interest income in this case you definitely want a lawyer to draw up the papers i think there are services on the web specialize in helping to set this up properly and which offer services such as bookkeeping and monthly billing at extra cost to make it less hassle for the lender if the loan will be structured as a mortgage on the borrower 's house making the interest deductible for the borrower in the us there are additional forms that need to be filled the services can help with that too for appropriate fees again this probably wants experts writing the agreement to make sure it 's properly written for where you and the borrower live caveat all the above is assuming usa rules may be very different elsewhere i 've done a formal mortgage mostly to avoid gift tax and it was n't too awful a hassle your mileage will vary

i would just do a loan for a different number of years on your new mortgage for example if you just spent 10 years paying off your first house then for your second close the first mortgage upon selling and then open a 20 or 25 year mortgage and the loan end date as well as the payment should remain similar this would be more do able if you paid ahead a little to compensate all the early on interest you have to eat so if you want to finish around the same time you could look into doing that since you 'll have more equity to make a stronger down payment

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

it is going to save you more money in the long run to pay at once with cash if you take out a loan you will pay interest on the balance costing you money if you pay off the balance immediately there is no difference between the options and your question becomes irrelevant   there is no credit rating benefit to placing large purchases on your cards especially since your credit is fine my advice is to pay in cash in this case mostly because it makes you feel the purchase this is what you are describing in your question this instinct helps you recognize potential problems instead of masking them with debt questions like do i need this   am i myself financially with this purchase   am i holding enough cash on hand for emergencies you may be fine in these areas but i would still argue that cash makes you a better buyer because the expense feels much more significant making you more cautious and   you are right to feel these things before dropping a large sum of money let it inform you and help you make better decisions do n't mask it or be paralyzed by it

i also had a student loan and glad you are taking a good look on interest rate as it really makes a huge difference one of the strategies i followed was since my credit improved as i stepped out of school i took advantage of a good 0 percent credit card i applied for discover and got a decent credit limit there are 2 particular things you are looking for in a credit card in this situation   usually the initial $ 0 transaction charge is only for a couple of months so ensure you take advantage of that what is the benefit imagine being able to pay off that higher interest rate balance with 0 and not have to worry about it immediately that way you save on the interest you would be paying and stress as well watch out for although you have to ensure that you do payoff the money you paid through the 0 percent credit card which may have been put off for a year or even 15 months or so other wise you may have to pay it all at once as the offer is expiring note for credit cards ensure to note when the 0 is expiring as that is usually not mentioned on the statement and you may have to call the customer service i was in a similar situation and was able to pay it all off fairly quickly i am sure you will as well

in theory yes so as long as someone will accept you as a very mature student you plan to never earn over a year for the next 30 years no longer wiped out at 65 you could get a loan slightly unless you fancy doing the course also if you did have to start paying it back since interest rates are currently 6.1 this means the loan is doubling potentially just under every 12 years approx as to the side question of is it fraud   i could n't say   is a student getting maximum loans but planning on being a jobless bum for the rest of their lives and never paying back loans also committing fraud   one could argue yes but i do n't believe a lack of ambition is currently illegal

i up voted joetaxpayer but i would like add a couple of things dollar cost averaging over a 5 day period is in no way practical   if you get a 1 swing in that time that would be quite a lot personally i think 5 years is way to long   when markets go down they go down fast i would suggest 1 to 2 years investing quarterly    i would hate seeing you miss out on market gains for a 5 year period on the last of your money the whole point of dollar cost averaging instead of market timing is the mantra its about time in the market not timing the market   so if you have money on the sidelines for years you are missing out on your time in the market

i respectfully disagree with eric   if you invest from day one in a roth where exactly will taxable income come from to put you in a higher bracket at retirement i agree maybe for other reasons than you list that early on post tax is the way to go because i 'll assume that one starts work in a lower bracket there 's probably a majority who start work in the 15 bracket but over time work their way to 25 as they grow to 25 using the pretax 401(k and ira can keep them at 15 for some number of years in any year of low income for whatever reason they can convert the pretax money to roth to top off the 15 bracket   to bring the point home if you went post tax the whole way imagine retiring with $ 2 m in the roth but no pretax money you now have a standard deduction exemption and the full 10 bracket each and every year gone to waste money you paid 25 tax when you could be paying zero on some of it the deduction and exemption add to $ in 2012 and the 10 rate applies to the first $ of taxable income if you do the math this is $ 17,500 and if you plan a 4 withdrawal rate you 'd need pretax money to give you the each year last all three factors standard deduction exemption and bracket limits all rise a bit each year an increase of $ 200 is another $ 5000 to save pretax   edit 2013 brought the ability to convert within one 's 401(k from the traditional pretax side to the roth side this makes possible turning 100 of one 's 401(k money to roth and retiring without the of the standard deduction exemptions etc

you ca n't transfer mortgages when you purchase a new property you can purchase a new property now or you can refinance your current property now and leverage yourself as far as possible while rates are low the higher rates you are worried about may not be as bad as you think with higher interest rates that may put downward pressure on housing prices or when rates do rise it may simply move from historic lows to relative lows i had a mortgage at 4.25 that i never bothered refinancing even though rates went much lower because the savings in interest paid minus my tax deduction for mortgage interest did n't amount to more than the cost of refinancing if rates go back up to 5 that will still be very affordable

so if i understand the investment program here you have $ 100 of tax withheld from your salary at the end of jan feb mar until december   this withholding is in excess of the expected tax for the year you use the appropriate h&r block product to file your taxes and h&r block gets your refund of $ 1200 on march 1st   h&r block adds 10 and give you e cards for $ on the face of it this represents a return of per year compounded monthly however there are a few wrinkles that might make the scheme less inviting you 'll get a receipt for miscellaneous income from h&r block and pay tax on the earnings the quoted return is only realized if you can use the e cards immediately   if they sit around for a while then they are n't earning any interest   if you sell them for cash at a discount if you even can   then this reduces the return   if you do n't cash them at all they 're a total loss this offer was announced on jan 15 2015   so you ca n't go back and put it in place for 2014   and if you set it up for withholding in 2015 is there any guarantee that it the same offer will be in place when filing in 2016

the government could actually do either one to expand the money supply as necessary to keep up with rising productivity an increased labor supply   the question is merely political in the case of the us printing money involves convincing politicians to spend it   while we currently run a deficit there is a large lobby within the us who are incredibly anti deficit and are fighting against this for no good reason   if the money supply were left in their hands we would end up with a shrinking money supply and rapid deflation on the other hand the fed can simply bypass the politicians and control the money supply directly by issuing bonds   it 's easier for them they do n't have to explain it to voters only to economists and it gives them more direct control without any messy political considerations like which programs to expand or cut

you only insure assets and you only insure them for the people that depend on them you do n't need to insure a liability therefore example i have life insurance equal to a couple of years salary in order to make sure my wife does n't encounter any hardships if i die i 'm the primary income earner and she will take of the kids once we have kids we 'll get life insurance for her to cover what the costs would be to take care of the kids if she were to die

overall lcr is good for the financial system and makes for healthier more liquid banks but some of the assumptions are heavy handed   for instance if a non bank fi has a used for backstop subscription facilities lcr assumes they will draw 100 of the in a 30-day stress case 100 percent so the bank has to hold $ 1 of liquid assets for every $ 1 of commitment not even actual lending outflow rates are similarly conservative for other borrowers 30 for corporate cp backstop facilities which are only available to the most creditworthy companies   another issue is that some high quality liquid assets actually attract basel 3 capital so lcr is forcing banks to hold these assets which increase their capital requirement it 's double jeopardy   and of course there 's the additional cost and operational risk of implementing and monitoring any new regulation banks must hire or train people to calculate lcr and those people can make mistakes leading to penalties however most large banks have been calculating lcr well ahead of the phase in date

first thing to know about investing is that you make money by taking risks that means the possibility of losing money as well as making it   there are low risk investments that pretty much always pay out but they do n't earn much making $ 200 a month on $ 10,000 is about 26 per year   that 's vastly more than you are going to earn on low risk assets if you want that kind of return you can invest in a diversified portfolio of equities through an equity index fund   some years you may make 26 or more   other years you may make nothing or lose that much or more   on average you may earn maybe hopefully overall investing is a game of making money over long horizons   it 's very useful for putting away your $ 10k now and having hopefully more than that when it comes time to buy a house or retire or something some years into the future   you have to accept that you might also end up with less than $ 10 k in the end but you are more likely to make money than to use it what you describe does n't seem like a possible situation   in developed markets you ca n't reliably expect anything close to the return you desire from assets that are unlikely to lose you money   it might be time to re evaluate your financial goals   do you want spending money now or do you want to invest for use down the road

individuals most definitely can have nol this is covered in the irs publication what is the difference between nol and capital loss nol is net operating loss i.e. a situation where your allowable expenses and deductions exceed your gross income basically it means that you have negative income for that year for tax purposes capital loss occurs when the total amount of your capital gains reported on schedule d is negative what are their relations then not all expenses and deductions that you usually put on your tax return are allowed for nol calculation for example capital loss is not allowed i.e. if you earned $ 2000 and you lost in stocks $ 3000 you do not get a $ 1 k nol capital losses are excluded from nol calculation and in this scenario you still have non negative income for nol purposes even though it is offset in full by capital loss deduction and your taxable income line is negative the $ 1 k that was not allowed gets carried forward to the next year using the capital loss carryover worksheet in the instructions to schedule d. you calculate your nol using form schedule a. you can use the form to apply the nol to prior 2 years or you can elect to apply it only to future years up to 20 years in what cases capital loss can be nol never

in my opinion the ability to set a sell or buy price is the least of my concerns   your question of whether to choose individual stocks vs funds prompts a different issue for me to bring to light choosing stocks that beat the market is not simple in fact a case can be made for the fact that the average fund lags the market by more and more over time in the end that fact and going with the lowest cost funds or etfs will beat 90 of investors over time

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

most bond etfs have switched to monthly dividends paid on the first of each month in an attempt to standardize across the market   for etfs but perhaps not bond mutual funds as suggested in the above answer interest does accrue in the nav so the price of the fund does drop on ex date by an amount equal to the dividend paid a great example of this dynamic can be seen in a bond etf holding floating rate corporate bonds   as you can see in this screenshot the nav has followed a sharp up and down pattern almost like the teeth of a saw this is explained by interest accruing in the nav over the course of each month until it is paid out in a dividend dropping the nav sharply in one day the effect has been particularly pronounced recently because the floating coupon payments have increased significantly benchmark interest rates are higher and mark to market changes in credit spreads of the constituent bonds have been very muted

co signing is not the same as owning if your elderly lady did n't make any payments on the loan and is n't on the ownership of the car and there was no agreement that you would pay her anything then you do not owe either her or her daughter any money also the loan is not affecting the daughter 's credit and the mother 's credit is irrelevant since she is dead however you should be aware that the finance company will want to know about the demise of the mother since they can no longer make a claim against her if you default i would start by approaching the loan company telling them about the mother 's death and asking to refinance in your name only if you 've really been keeping up the payments well this could be ok with them if not i would find someone else who is prepared to co sign a new loan with you and still refinance then just tell the daughter that the loan her mother co signed for has been discharged and there is nothing for her to worry about

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

diversification tends to protect you from big losses but it also tends to protect you from big gains in any industry some companies provide good products and services and prosper while others have problems and fail or maybe the winners are just lucky or they paid off the right politicians whatever not the point here if you put all your money in one stock and they do well you could make a bundle but if you pick a loser you could lose your entire investment if you buy a little stock in each of many companies then some will go up and some will go down and your returns will be an average of how everyone in the industry is doing suppose i offered to bet you a large sum of money that if i roll a die it will come up 6 you might be reluctant to take that bet because you ca n't predict what number will come up on one roll of a die but suppose i offered to bet you a large sum of money that a die will come up 6 100 times in a row you might well take that bet because the chance that it will turn up 6 time after time after time is very low you reduce risk by spreading your bets anyone who 's bought stock has surely had times when he said oh man if only i 'd bought x ten years ago i 'd be a millionaire now but quite a few have also said if only i 'd sold x ten years ago i would n't have lost all this money   i recently bought a stock a stock that within a few months rose to 10 times what i paid for it and then a few months later the company went bankrupt and the stock was worth nothing i knew the company was on a roller coaster when i bought the stock i was gambling that they 'd pull through and i 'd make money i guessed wrong fortunately i gambled an amount that i was willing to lose
