no a company can not bill you for services you did not request nor receive if they could imagine how many people would just randomly get bills in their mail ignore them they do n't have a contract or agreement with you and ca n't do anything other than make noise if they get aggressive or do n't stop requesting money hire an attorney and it will be taken care of
# 249106
in general you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract the contract does n't have to be written but you have to have agreed to it somehow however it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners association there are also sometimes services you are legally required to get such as regular inspection of heating furnaces though i do n't think this translates to automatic contracts but in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract which sounds like it 's the case here

here 's another example of such a practice and the problem it caused   my brother who lived alone was missing from work for several days so a co worker went to his home to search for him and called the local sheriff 's office for assistance   the local fire department which runs the ems ambulance was also in the event there was a medical emergency   they discovered my brother had passed away inside his home and had obviously been dead for days   as our family worked on probate matters to settle his estate following this death it was learned that the local fire department had levied a bill against my brother 's estate for $ 800 for responding with their ambulance to his home that day   i tried to talk to their commander about this insisting my brother had not called them nor had they transported him or even checked his pulse   the commander insisted theirs was common practice that someone was always billed for their medical response   he would not withdraw his bill for services   i hate to say but the family paid the bill in order to prevent delay of his probate issues and from receiving monies that paid for his final expenses

i have had a couple of businesses do this to me   i simply ask them to come over to talk about the bill   sometimes this ends it   if they come over then i call the cops to file a report on fraud   a lot of times the police will do nothing unless they have had a load of complaints but it certainly gets the company off your back   and if they are truly unscrupulous it does n't hurt to get a picture of them talking with the police and their van and then post the whole situation online you will see others come forward really quick after doing something like this

see my comment for some discussion of why one might choose an identical fund over an etf   as to why someone would choose the higher cost fund in this instance the admiral shares version of the fund vfiax has the same expense ratio as the etf but has a minimum investment of $ 10k.   some investors may want to eventually own the admiral shares fund but do not yet have $ 10k.   if they begin with the investor shares now and then convert to admiral later that conversion will be a non taxable event   if however they start with etf shares now and then sell them later to buy the fund that sale will be a taxable event vanguard etfs are only commission free to vanguard clients using vanguard brokerage services   some investors using other brokers may face all sorts of penalties for purchasing third party etfs   some retirement plan participants either at vanguard or another broker may not even be allowed to purchase etfs

this is exactly what needs to happen for the benefit of the country do n't make this a republican vs democrat thing the mortgage interest deduction causes artificially high home prices and discourages building small affordable homes home purchase prices falling means builders might start building smaller cheaper homes again if it causes a housing crisis it will be for those who bought 3000 sq ft on what used to be farmland    removing the state and local tax deduction means there might finally be incentive for cities to consolidate local and increase overall efficiency again the ultra wealthy that keep poor people out through high taxes will decrease and join other larger local governments this would be a huge plus as far as tax reform goes

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

one of the main criticisms made by product companies especially publishers of amazon.com is that it violates the price floors on various products when amazon routinely sells products at a heavily discounted price the product companies feel that the product gets devalued amazon has often been accused of anticompetitive behavior because other retailers can not compete with their discounts   it 's interesting that this article makes the exact opposite claim that the product companies are the ones who are anticompetitive

unfortunately i believe there is not a good answer to this because it 's not a well posed problem   it sounds like you are looking for a theoretically sound criteria to decide whether to sell or hold   such a criteria would take the form of calculating the cost of continuing to hold a stock and comparing it to the transactions cost of replacing it in your portfolio however your criteria for stock selection does n't take this form   you appear to have some ad hoc rules defining whether you want the stock in your portfolio that provide no way to calculate a cost of having something in your portfolio you do n't want or failing to have something you do want   criteria for optimally rebalancing a portfolio ca n't really be more quantitative than the rules that define the portfolio

to answer your original question there is proof out there here is a paper from the federal reserve bank of st. louis that might be worth a read   it has a lot of references to other publications that might help answer your about ta   you can probably read the whole article then research some of the other ones listed there to come up with a conclusion   below are some excerpts   abstract this article introduces the subject of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market with emphasis on its importance for questions of market efficiency   technicians view their craft the study of price patterns as exploiting psychological   the literature on technical analysis has established that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates provided 15 years of positive risk adjusted returns during the 1970s and 80s before those returns were extinguished   more recently more complex and less studied rules have produced     more modest returns for a similar length of time   conventional explanations that rely on risk adjustment and/or central bank intervention do not plausibly justify the observed excess returns from following simple technical trading rules   psychological biases however could contribute to the profitability of these rules we view the observed pattern of excess returns to technical trading rules as being consistent with an adaptive markets view of the world     and   the widespread use of technical analysis in foreign exchange and    other markets is because it implies   that either traders are    irrationally making decisions on useless information or that past    prices contain useful   information for trading   the latter    possibility would contradict the efficient markets hypothesis    which holds that   no trading strategy should be able to generate    unusual profits on publicly available information such as past     prices except by bearing unusual risk and the observed   level of    risk adjusted profitability measures market   therefore    much research effort has been directed toward determining whether    technical analysis is   indeed profitable or not one of the earliest    studies by fama and 1966 found no evidence that a particular    class of could earn abnormal profits in the stock market    however more recent research by   and 1992    and sullivan an d white 1999 has provided contrary    evidence and   many studies of the foreign exchange market have found    evidence that can generate persistent profits   6   1967    and 1984 1986 and thomas 1993    and 1997   1999 lee and    2001 and martin 2001

which means the current total is $ is that correct yep unfortunately the current gm stock is different than the gm stock of 1989   gm went bankrupt in 2011   it 's original stock changed to motors liquidation company and is essentially worthless today   there was no conversion from the old stock to the new stock what do i do with these certificates can i bring them to my bank or do i need to open an account with a stock company like fidelity see here for some instructions on cashing them in or at least registering them electronically   i 've never dealt with physical stocks but i presume that a broker is going to charge you something for registering them vs. direct registration though i have no idea how much that would be i read somewhere that i only have to pay taxes when i cash out these stocks but are these rules any different because i inherited the stocks you will pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the time your father died to the time you sell the shares   if that time is more than one year and the stock has gone up in value you will pay a 15 tax on the total increase   if you have held them less than one year they will be short term capital gains which will count as regular income and you will pay whatever your marginal tax rate is if you sell the stock at a loss then you 'll be able to deduct some or all of that loss from your income and may be able to carry forward losses for a few years as well i did not catch that the stock you mention was gm stock   gm went bankrupt in 2011 so it 's likely that the stock you own is worthless   i have edited the first answer appropriately but left the other two since they apply more generally   in your case the best you get is a tax deduction for the loss in value from the date your father died

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

you seem to have all your financial bases covered and others have given you good financial advice so i will try to give you some non financial ideas the first and most important thing is that you are investing with a long time friend so the dynamics are a lot different that if you had recently met a stranger with an interesting new idea the first thing you need to ask yourself is if your friendship will survive if this thing does n't go well you 've already said you can afford to lose the money so that 's not a worry but will there be any the flip side is also true if the venture succeeds you should be able to go further with it because he 's your friend you know your friend better back to grade school than almost anyone else so here are some things to ask yourself what does your friend have that will give him a chance to succeed tech savvy a winning personality a huge general business savvy something else if your guardian angel had told you that one of your friends was planning to on an internet advertising venture is this the one you would have guessed conversely knowing that your friend was planning to do a start up is this the kind of venture you would have guessed how does internet and advertising fit in with what you are doing if this venture succeeds could it be used to help your professional development and career maybe as a supplier or customer can you see yourself leaving your current job and joining your friend 's now established company as a vice president or acting as a member of its board of directors the latter perhaps while pursuing your current career path   are your other mutual friends investing are some of them more tech savvy than you and better able to judge the company 's prospects of success to a certain extent there is safety in numbers and even if there is n't misery loves company on the upside would you feel left out if everyone in your crowd caught the next microsoft except you

the bonus share also improves the liquidity however there is some difference in treatment lets say a company has 100 shares of $ 10 ea the total capital of the is 100 10 = 1000 assuming the company is doing well its share is now available in the market for $ 100 ea now lets say the company has made a profit of $ 1000 and this also gets factored into the price of $ 100 lets say the company decides to keep this $ 1000 kept as cash reserve and is not distributed as dividends    in a share split say 1:1 the book value of each share is now reduced to $ 5 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital stays at 200 5 = 1000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    in a bonus share issue say 1:1 the funds $ 1000 are moved from cash reserve and transferred to share capital the book value of each share will remain same as $ 10 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital increases to 200 10 = 2000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    so essentially from a liquidity point of view both give the same benefit as to why some companies issue bonus and not a split this is because of multiple reasons a split beyond a point can not be done ie $ 10 can be split to $ 1 ea but it does n't look good to make it $ 0.50 the other reason is there is adequate cash reserve and you want to convert this into share holders capital having a larger share holders capital improves some of the health ratios for the at times is used to play upon that one is getting something free

yes that is correct note when there is a tax treaty between canada and the other country which is pretty much anywhere you have active treaties conventions the tax credits are equal to the income received making it tax free here is a better explanation   gt the greatest advantage of having a foreign affiliate in the international business setting is   to repatriate foreign profits back to canada tax free under certain conditions for example   if a foreign affiliate carries on an active business in a designated treaty country i.e. a   country with which canada has a tax treaty the after tax profit is included in a pool   called exempt surplus if the repatriation of profit in the form of dividend was paid out   of the exempt surplus pool to a canadian corporate shareholder such dividend is   included in its income and the same amount is allowed to be deducted in computing its   taxable income in other words the dividend is not subject to canadian tax if received by   a canadian corporate shareholder    source test files 22   edit here from the site   gt treaty countries active business income earned in a treaty country is classified as exempt surplus the exempt surplus of an fa also includes inter affiliate dividends received out of the exempt surplus of other foreign affiliates the exempt portion 25 of all capital gains and certain taxable capital gains dividends paid out of the exempt surplus of an fa can be received free of additional taxes in canada since the profits out of which they are paid are considered to have borne a rate of tax in the treaty country comparable to that of canada   mining materials see the section on subsidiary income this is the reason bk is moving to canada also here is a very interesting deck on corporate tax in latin america by the canadian mining wp content

let me provide a general answer that might be helpful to others without addressing those specific stocks dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company   a company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by dividend yield traps   if a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay   there are exceptions like what happened with bp but these exceptions are rare   just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future   if the company continues to pay a dividend in the future it may be at a significantly different amount some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends   these companies may have unusually high dividends but this is simply a result of the corporate structure     let me provide a quick example certain etfs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the etf there is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100 certainty   even large companies like general electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis   so to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following update in regards to one the first stock you mentioned this sentence from the companies of yahoo finance explains the unusually dividend the company has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax if it distributes at least 90 of its reit taxable income to its share holders

i do n't know what country you live in or what the laws and practical circumstances of owning rental property there are but i own a rental property in the u.s. and i can tell you that there are a lot of headaches that go with it one maintenance you say you have to pay an annual fee of 2,400 for building maintenance does that cover all maintenance to the unit or only the exterior i mean here in the u.s. if you own a condo we call a unit like you describe a condo if you rent it it 's an apartment if you own it it 's a condo you typically pay an annual fee that cover maintenance from the walls out that is it covers maintenance to the exterior of the building the parking lot any common recreational areas like a swimming pool etc but it does n't cover interior maintenance if there 's a problem with interior wiring or plumbing or the carpet needs to be replaced or the place needs painting that 's up to you   with a rental unit those expenses can be substantial on my rental property sure most months the maintenance is zero things do n't break every month but if the furnace needs to be replaced or there 's a major plumbing problem it can cost thousands and you can get hit with lots of expenses while my place was vacant i turned the water heater down to save on utility expenses then a tenant moved in and complained that the water heater did n't work we sent a plumber out who quickly figured out that she did n't realize she had to turn the knob up then of course he had to hang around while the water heated up to make sure that was all it was it cost me umm i think $ 170 to have someone turn that knob but i probably saved over $ 15 on the gas bill by turning it down for the couple of months the place was empty two what happens when you get a bad tenant here in the u.s. theoretically you only have to give 3 days notice to evict a tenant who damages the property or fails to pay the rent but in practice they do n't leave then you have to go to court to get the police to throw them out when you contact the court they will schedule a hearing in a month or two if your case is clear cut like the tenant has n't paid the rent for two months or more you will win easily both times i 've had to do this the tenant did n't even bother to show up so i won by default so then you have a piece of paper saying the court orders them to leave you have to wait another month or two for the police to get around to actually going to the unit and ordering them out so say a tenant fails to pay the rent in real life you 're probably not going to evict someone for being a day or two late but let 's say you 're pretty hard about it and start eviction proceedings when they 're a month late there 's at least another two or three months before they 're actually going to be out of the place of course once you send them an eviction notice they 're not going to pay the rent any more so you have to go four five months with these people living in your property but not paying any rent on top of that some tenants do serious damage to the property it 's not theirs they do n't have much incentive to take care of it if you evict someone they may deliberately trash the place out of spite one tenant i had to evict did over $ 13,000 in damage so i 'm not saying do n't rent the place out what i am saying is be sure to include all your real costs in your calculation think of all the things that could go wrong as well as all the things that could go right

there is some element of truth to what your realtor said   the seller takes the house off the market after the offer is accepted but the contract is contingent upon among other things buyer securing the financing a lower down payment can mean a higher chance of failing that the buyer might be going through fha va or other programs that have additional restrictions if the buyer fails to secure a financing that 's weeks and months lost to the seller in a seller 's market this can be an important factor in how your bid is perceived by the seller sometimes it even helps to disclose your credit score for the same reason of course for your situation you will have to assess whether this is the case certainly do not let your realtor push you around to do things you are not comfortable with edit   a higher down payment also helps in the situation where the house appraisal does not fare well   as @dilip sarwate has pointed out the particular area you are interested in is probably a seller 's market thus giving sellers more leverage in picking bids all else equal if you are the seller with multiple offers coming in at similar price level would you pick the one with 20 down or 5 down while it is true that realtors have their own motives to push through a deal as quickly as possible the sellers can also be in the same boat one less mortgage payment is not trivial to many it 's a complicated issue as every party involved have different interests again do your own due diligence be educated and make informed decisions

gt a significant proportion of recent economic growth has relied on borrowed money today standing at a 325 percent of global gross domestic product debt allows society to accelerate consumption as borrowings are used to purchase something today against the promise of future repayment unfunded entitlements to social services health care and pensions increase those liabilities the bill for these commitments will soon become unsustainable as demographic changes make it more difficult to meet

great answer by only thing to add is that the option itself becomes a tradeable asset here 's my go at filling out the answer from hey kid so you have this brand new video game manic that you paid $ 50 for on jan 1st that you want to sell two months from now yes mr. video game broker but i want to lock in a price so i know how much to save for a new tickle me for my baby sister ok for $ 3 i 'll sell you a put option so you can sell the game to me for $ 40 in two months kid says ok sends $ 3 to mr game broker who sends our kid a piece of paper saying the holder of this piece of paper can sell the game manic to mr game broker for $ 40 on march 1st one month later news comes out that manic is full of bugs and the price in the shops is heavily discounted to $ 30 mr options trader realizes that our kid holds a contract written by mr game broker which effectively allows our kid to sell the game at $ 10 over the price of the new game so maybe about $ 15 over the price in the second hand market which he might be about $ 25 on march 1st he calls up our kid hey kid you know that put option that mr game broker sold to you you a month ago wanna sell it to me for $ 13 he wants to get it a couple of bucks cheaper than his $ 15 fair valuation kid thinks   hmmm that would be a $ 10 net profit for me on that put option but i would n't be able to sell the game for $ 40 next month i 'd likely only get something like $ 25 for it so i would kind of be getting $ 10 now rather than potentially getting $ 12 in a month note the $ 12 is because there could be $ 15 from exercising the put option selling for $ 40 a game worth only $ 25 in the second hand market minus the original cost of $ 3 for the put option kid likes the idea and replies done next day kid sends the put option contract to mr options trader and receives $ 13 in return our kid bought the put option and later sold it for a profit and all of this happened before the option reached its expiry date

others have pointed out that the entities loaning money to the government are typically people and institutions   recently however the us federal government borrowings were largely funded by money printed by the federal reserve   the government had to borrow $ 1.1 trillion from october 2010 through june 2011   during this period the fed printed around $ 0.8 trillion new dollars to purchase us debt   thus the us government was not borrowing money from people it was being funded by money printing   the central bankers call this quantitative easing

this does not really fit your liquidity requirement but consider buying a one or two room apartment to rent out with part of your savings you will get income from it and small apartments sell quickly if you do need the money this will help offset the negative interest from the rest one downside is that other people have the same idea at the moment and the real estate prices are inflated somewhat

you are making an assumption that may not be true to me some apartment debt i paid had already been sold to a collections agency before i actually paid it typically debts are sold to a debt buyer whereas a collection agency works on commission to collect debts on behalf of the creditor if your debt was actually sold you should have been notified in writing of this fact and who the new creditor was i suspect your debt was not sold because if it was the apartment complex would not have been legally allowed to cash your check when you finally paid them therefore it is most likely that the collection agency was working on commission and the apartment complex never informed them that you had settled your debt as for what to do about it here are 3 options ordered by likelihood of success good luck and if you do n't mind please update us later on what you did and what the result was your experience will be helpful for others having this issue in the future

# 446633
it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

why would you want to withdraw only the company match and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex company 's 401k plan generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over part or all of your 401k assets into an ira and withdraw the rest for personal expenses   if your personal contributions are in a roth 401k roll them over to a roth ira but as i remember it company contributions are not part of the roth 401k and must be rolled over into a traditional ira perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for your personal purchase also what is this 30 hit you are talking about you will owe income tax on the money withdrawn from the 401k and custodians traditionally withhold 20 and send it to the irs on your behalf plus penalty for early withdrawal which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them but the tax that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a new job that is the 30 hit may be on the cash flow but you may get some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return

your heart is in the right place especially since they 've got a kid if you really want to help them have the uncomfortable conversation with them that they need to have about money specifically how to develop and stick to a budget it is a painful but valuable lesson for life   depending on what type of relationship you have with them you can approach it in different ways just giving them friendly advice is perhaps the touch you could have but might not make the impression you need   if they are asking you for money i would personally make it a condition that they work through their personal budget with you and then start living within that budget if you 're lending money it 's not too much to ask to follow their accounts or finances so that you can see that they 're on the right track if you 're a close enough friend you could really walk them through it and help them to develop the habits of estimating how much they will earn in a month estimating how much they should spend in a month   tracking how much they are actually spending and   comparing how much they actually earn with how much they actually spend   doing this every month until they get out of the weeds they should at least do it every 3 months when they 're in good financial shape but even then each month does n't hurt setting them up with something like mint.com if they 're in the us would be a handy place to start you can share the login information with them if they trust you and then they can change it once whatever agreed upon terms come around   it sounds weird i know but i have helped two friends out of credit card debt this way the hardest part is getting around the discomfort taboo shame of them knowing they need help and not wanting to accept it

years ago i wrote an article risk reward coin flipping which explains from a game theory perspective how diversifying works to minimize standard deviation in one 's returns   it 's long and tedious not easy to summarize but it holds up well i 'm pleased with how the analogy does its job   update the above is too link only written over 5 years ago the article i wrote offers a mathematical approach via an understandable example of coin flipping with just 2 options a head is a 10 loss while a tail is a 30 gain this actually represents the market fairly well as it results in a 10 average gain and 28 standard deviation for just 2 flips the article shows how by diversifying choosing to make multiple smaller bets the average 10 stays the same but the standard deviation is brought down dramatically 7.6 when we use a sample experiment with 7 coins

a stock insurance company is structured like a normal company it has shareholders that are the company 's investors who elect a board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company the directors and thus the executives and employees have a legal responsibility to manage the company in a way which is beneficial for the shareholders since the shareholders are the ultimate owner of the company a mutual insurance company is similar except that the people holding policies are also the shareholders that is the policyholders are the ultimate owners of the company and there generally are n't separate shareholders who are just investing in the company these shareholders elect the board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company in practice it probably does n't really make a whole lot of difference since even if you 're just a customer and not an owner of the company the company is still going to want to attract customers and act in a reasonable way toward them also insurance companies are generally pretty heavily regulated in terms of what they can do because governments really like them to remain solvent it may be comforting to know that in a mutual insurance company the higher ups are explicitly supposed to be working in your best interest though rather than in the interest of some random investors some might object that being a shareholder may not give you a whole lot more rights than you had before see for example this article from the boston globe at mutual insurance firms big money for insiders but no say for policyholders it has grown into something else entirely an opaque poorly understood and often immensely profitable world in which some executives and insiders operate with minimal scrutiny and no coincidence often reap maximum personal rewards policyholders despite their status as owners have no meaningful oversight of how mutual companies spend their money whether to lower rates pay dividends or fund executive salaries and perks and few avenues to challenge such decisions another reason that one might not like the conversion is the specific details of how the current investor shareholders are being paid back for their investment in the process of the conversion to mutual ownership and what that might do to the funds on hand that are supposed to be there to keep the firm solvent for the policyholders from another boston globe article on the conversion of sbli to a mutual company insurer sbli wants to get banks out of its business professor robert wright is cautiously optimistic but wants to ensure the prior shareholders are n't overpaid robert wright a professor in south dakota who has studied insurance companies and owns an sbli policy said he would prefer the insurer to be a mutual company that does n’t have to worry about the short term needs of shareholders but he wants to ensure that sbli does n’t overpay the banks for their shares it ’s fine as long as it ’s a fair price he said that article also gives sbli 's president 's statement as to why they think it 's a good thing for policyholders if the banks remained shareholders they would be likely to demand a greater share of the profits and eat into the dividends the insurance company currently pays to the policyholders about half of whom live in massachusetts said jim morgan president of based sbli we ’re trying to protect the policyholders from having the dividends diluted morgan said i 'm not sure there 's an obvious pros cons list for either way but i 'd think that i 'd prefer the mutual approach just on the principle that the policyholders ought to be the owners because the directors and thus the executives and employees are then legally required to manage the company in the best interest of the policyholders i did cast a yes vote in my proxy on whether sbli ought to become a mutual company i 'm a sbli term life but policy terms are n't changing and it 'd be hard to tell for sure how it 'd impact any dividends i assume the whole life policies must be the ones to pay dividends or company solvency either way since it 's not like we 'll get to run a scientific experiment trying it out both ways i doubt you 'd have a lot of regrets either way whether it becomes a mutual company and you wish it had n't or it does n't become one and you wish it had

i came across such a situation and i am still facing it my friend borrowed my credit card for his expenses as he had misplaced his debit card and for the time being had asked for my credit card to handle the expenses he does he paid for initial 2 months and then was not able to make payments mainly due to not being able to arrange money or if it was a party he would collect cash from friends but again spend the same months passes by the bill had come upto 65k and calls from bank and other respective organizations finally my dad came into picture and slowly the issue is resolving he has paid 50 k remaining is still pending    so basically the reason i shared this part of story was he is my best friend and in order to not spoil our friendship i did not want to take any such step which would later on affect our friendship this completely depends on the individuals how they react to the situation keeping ego superiority favour sort of feelings and words apart things can be resolved between friends you do not know what is the situation on the other side   probably you can connect with him ask him to explain you why is not able to pay the debts and take action accordingly if he is not able to provide a proper reason then you may take some actions like mentioned in initial answers run after the assets he own or anything else stay calm and patient do not take any such step which you would regret later on

i can see your point   there are more investors than investment banks so the power of each investment bank is substantially more than each individual investor   it would take a lot of coordinated effort on the part of investors to alter the balance of power   and to an extent a new or existing and improved ratings agency would be a proxy war between investors and investment banks even though the direct competition would be with other ratings agencies   at the same time ratings agencies as an industry have never had less credibility nor have the investment banks for that matter   i have to believe there is a realistic way to exploit that reality

   operations organized and by foreign governments have played a substantial role in the political and economic development of poorer countries around the world we look at cia backed against governments which had nationalized a considerable amount of foreign investment using an event study methodology we find that private information regarding coup authorizations and planning increased the stock prices of multinationals that stood to benefit from the regime change the presence of these abnormal returns suggests that there were leaks of classified information to asset traders consistent with theories of asset price determination under private information this information often took some time to be fully reflected in the stock price we find that coup authorizations on net contributed substantially more to stock price rises of highly exposed companies than the coup events themselves    gt;this suggests that most of the value of the coup to the affected companies had already been anticipated and incorporated into the asset price before the operation was undertaken

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

in terms of preserving good relationships one approach is to charge a nominal rate of interest maybe a few percent of the total and agree a time when it should be paid back this may actually make them feel better about borrowing them money especially especially if it is something like business loan or buying a house or car   if they need the money for a real crisis and they have no clear strategy for paying it back then it may just be better all around if you make it clear that it is a gift   what you do n't want to do is set up a situation where you are creating unnecessary problems down the road and that will very much depend on your individual relationship and how seriously you take the loan   here it is important that you are completely open and honest about the arrangement so take the time to make sure that both parties understand exactly what they expect from each other

no a jump in market capitalization does not equal the amount that has been invested   market cap is simply the stock price times the total number of shares this represents a theoretical value of the company i say theoretical because the company might not be able to be sold for that at all   the quoted stock price is simply what the last buyer and seller of stock agreed upon for the price of their trade they really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that   the stock price can move on very little volume in this case amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday and the price jumped in after hours trading the stock price is up but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday   after the market opens today and many more shares are traded we 'll get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price but no matter what the price does the change in market cap does not equal the amount of new money being invested in the company market cap is the price of the most recent trades extrapolated out across all the shares

selling stock means selling a portion of ownership in your company   any time you issue stock you give up some control unless you 're issuing non voting stock and even non voting stock owns a portion of the company thus issuing voting shares means either the current shareholders reduce their proportion of or the company stock it held back from a previous offering in which case it no longer has that stock available to issue and thus has less ability to raise funds in the future   from investopedia for secondary offerings in which new shares are underwritten and sold dilute the ownership position of stockholders who own shares that were issued in the ipo of course sometimes a secondary offering is more akin to mark zuckerberg selling some shares of facebook to allow him to diversify his holdings the original owner(s sell a portion of their holdings off   that does not dilute the ownership stake of others but does reduce their share of course you also give up some rights to dividends etc even if you issue non voting stock of course that is factored into the price presumably either the actual dividend or the prospect of eventually getting a dividend   and hopefully more growth leads to more dividends though that 's only true if the company can actually make good use of the incoming funds that last part is somewhat important   a company that has a good use for new funds should raise more funds because it will turn those $ 100 to $ 150 or $ 200 for everyone including the current owners   but a company that does n't have a particular use for more money would be wasting those funds and probably not earning back that full value for everyone the impact on stock price of course is also a major factor and not one to discount even a company issuing non voting stock has a fiduciary responsibility to act in the interest of those non voting shareholders and so should not excessively dilute their value

people normally hold precious metals as a protection against the whole system going down massive inflation etc   if our whole government and financial system broke completely and we returned to a barter economy then holding silver would likely turn out to be a good thing however precious metals are not very good hedges against individual calamity like losing your job   they are costly and inconvenient to sell and the price of these metals fluctuates wildly so you could end up wanting to sell just when the metal is n't worth much i 'd say having some precious metal is n't unreasonable but it should not make up a major portion of one 's total net worth   if you want protection against normal problems especially as a person of limited means start with an emergency savings account and paying down debt   that way fixed costs will be less likely to turn an unfortunate turn of events into a personal catastrophe

due to the issues in the eurozone many foreign investors were buying swiss francs as a hedge against a euro devaluation they were in effect treating the franc like gold silver or some other commodity with perceived intrinsic value this causes huge problems from the swiss as the value of the franc increased and their exports became more expensive for foreigners to purchase things were getting bad enough that the swiss in some places were travelling to germany to buy groceries to enforce this fixing of the franc the swiss central bank announced that they would buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities by printing francs in reality just announcing that they were going to do this was sufficient to discourage foreign investors from loading up on francs npr 's planet money did a really good job covering this topic

this very topic was the subject of a question on workplace se tl dr   from tax publication 521 moving expenses table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements there are tax implications covered in tax publication 521 moving expenses and employers tax guide to fringe benefits related to moving expenses from the employers view moving expense reimbursements this exclusion applies to any amount you directly or indirectly give to an employee including services furnished in kind as payment for or reimbursement of moving expenses you must make the reimbursement under rules similar to those described in chapter 11 of publication 535 for reimbursement of expenses for travel meals and entertainment under accountable plans the exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the employee could deduct if he or she had paid or incurred them without reimbursement however it does not apply if the employee actually deducted the expenses in a previous year    deductible moving expenses    deductible moving expenses include only the reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from the former home to the new home and traveling including lodging from the former home to the new home deductible moving expenses do not include any expenses for meals and must meet both the distance test and the time test the distance test is met if the new job location is at least 50 miles farther from the employee 's old home than the old job location was the time test is met if the employee works at least 39 weeks during the first 12 months after arriving in the general area of the new job location for more information on deductible moving expenses see publication 521 moving expenses employee    for this exclusion treat the following individuals as employees a current employee a leased employee who has provided services to you on a substantially full time basis for at least a year if the services are performed under your primary direction or control exception for s corporation shareholders    do not treat a 2 shareholder of an s corporation as an employee of the corporation for this purpose a 2 shareholder is someone who directly or indirectly owns at any time during the year more than 2 of the corporation 's stock or stock with more than 2 of the voting power treat a 2 shareholder as you would a partner in a partnership for fringe benefit purposes but do not treat the benefit as a reduction in distributions to the 2 shareholder exclusion from wages    generally you can exclude qualifying moving expense reimbursement you provide to an employee from the employee 's wages if you paid the reimbursement directly to the employee report the amount in box 12 of form w-2 with the code p. do not report payments to a third party for the employee 's moving expenses or the value of moving services you provided in kind   from the employees view the not be included as income the expenses must be from an accountable plan accountable plans to be an accountable plan your employer 's reimbursement arrangement must require you to meet all three of the following rules your expenses must have a business connection that is you must have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer two examples of this are the reasonable expenses of moving your possessions from your former home to your new home and traveling from your former home to your new home you must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable period of time you must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time also what is interesting is the table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements

the only card i 've seen offer this on credit card purchases is discover   i think they have a special deal with the stores so that the cash over amount is not included in the percentage fee the merchant pays   the cash part shows up broken out from the purchase amount on the statement if this was purely something the store did on its own without some collaboration with discover that would not happen the first few times i 've seen the offer i assumed it would be treated like a cash advance high apr immediate interest with no grace period etc but it is not   it is treated like a purchase you have no interest charge if you pay in full during the grace period and no transaction fee   now i very rarely go to the atm what is in it for discover   they have a higher balance to charge you interest on if you ever fail to pay in full before the grace period   and discover does n't have any debit pin option that i know of so no concern of their other business   and happier customers what is in it for the grocer   happier customers and they need to have the armored car come around less often and spend less time counting internally

i would like to bring up some slightly different points than the ones raised in the excellent answers from joetaxpayer and littleadv   the estate can be the beneficiary of an ira indeed as has been pointed out this is the default beneficiary if the owner does not specify a beneficiary but a testamentary trust can not be the designated   beneficiary of an ira a testamentary trust that meets the requirements laid out on page 36 of publication 590 is essentially a pass through   entity that takes distributions from the ira and passes them on to the beneficiaries    for the case being considered here of minor beneficiaries the distributions from the   ira that pass through   the trust must be sent to the legal or other custodians of the minors utma accounts and said must invest these sums for the benefit of the minors and hand the monies over when the minors reach adulthood minors are not responsible for their support and so these monies can not be used by the legal guardian for the minors living expenses except as provided for in the utma regulations when the minors become adults they get all the accumulated value on their utma accounts and can start taking   the rmds personally after that and blowing them on motorcycles if they wish   thus the advantage of the testamentary trust is essentially that it lets the trustee of the trust to decide how much money over and above the rmd gets distributed each year   the minors and soon to be young adults can not take the entire ira in a lump sum etc but must abide by the testamentary trustee 's ideas of whether extra money over and above the rmd should be taken out   in any given year how much discretion is allowed to the trustee is also something to be thought through carefully but at least the rmd must be taken from the ira and distributed to the minors utma accounts or to the persons as they reach adulthood each year   regardless of whether the traditional ira goes to beneficiaries   directly or through a testamentary trust its value as of the date of death is still included in the estate and estate tax   might be due however beneficiaries can deduct the portion of estate tax paid by the estate from the income tax that they have to pay on the ira withdrawals estate planning is very tricky business and even lawyers very competent in estate and trust issues fall far short in their understanding of tax law especially income tax law

companies with existing borrowings where borrowings are on variable interest rates or in the case with fixed interest rates companies that get new borrowings would pay less interest on these borrowings so their cost will go down and profits up making them more attractive to investors   so in general lower interest rates will make the share market a more attractive investment than some alternatives as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns this will usually result in the stock market rising as it is currently in the us edit the case for rising interest rates a central bank 's purpose when raising interest rates is to slow down an economy that is booming as interest rates rise consumers will tighten up their spending and companies will thus have less revenue on top of higher costs for maintaining existing borrowing with variable rates or new borrowing with fixed rates if rates are higher companies may also defer new borrowings to expand their business this will eventually lead to lower profits and lower valuation for these companies another thing that happens is that as banks start increasing interest for saving accounts investors will look for safety where they can get a higher return than before without the risk of the stock market   with lowering profits and valuations and investor 's money flowing out of shares and into the money market so will company share prices drop although this may lag a bit with the share market still booming due to greed but once the boom stops for the crash

legally i ca n't find any reason that the llc could not lend money to an individual however i believe the simplest course of action is to first distribute money from your company to your personal account and then make it a personal loan whether the loan is done through the business or personally financially i do n't think there is much difference as to which bucket the interest income goes into since your business and personal income will all get lumped together anyway with a single person llc even if your friend defaults on the loan either the business or you personally will have the same burden of proof to meet that the loan was not a gift to begin with and if that burden is met the deduction can be taken from either side if a debt goes bad the debtor may be required to report the debt as income

most companies have gross margins because it 's not just tied to cost of goods but cost of revenue fedex has costs of revenue and therefore a gross margin   in some cases however yes some companies will not have a cost directly tied to revenue these are services companies in which an employees salary is by no means tied to the revenue i.e. a salary of $ 50k will still do $ 100k of work or $ 1 m of work with no change    edit work has me looking at american addiction centers which is an example of a company without cost of revenue goods

your friend probably can not deposit the check to your u.s. bank account u.s. banks that i 've worked with will not accept a deposit from someone who is not an owner of the account i do n't know why not if some stranger wants to make unauthorized deposits to my account why should i object but that 's the common rule   you could endorse the check your friend could then deposit it to his own account or cash it and then transfer the money to you in a variety of ways   but i think it would be easier to just deposit the check in your account wherever it is you live most banks have no problem with depositing a foreign check there may be a fairly long delay before you can get access to the money while the check clears through the system   i do n't know exactly what you mean by a prize check but assuming that this is taxable income yes i assume the u.s. government would want their hard earned share of your money these days you can pay u.s. taxes on line if you have a credit card if you have not already paid u.s. taxes for the year you should make an estimated payment i.e. you ca n't wait until april 15 of the next year you have to pay most or all of the taxes you will owe in the calendar year you earned it

purchases and sales from the same trade date will both settle on the same settlement date they do n't have to pay for their purchases until later either because hft typically make many offsetting trades buying selling buying selling buying selling etc when the purchases and sales settle the amount they pay for their purchases will roughly cancel with the amount they receive for their sales the difference being their profit or loss margin accounts and just having extra cash around can increase their ability to have trades that do not perfectly offset in practice the hft 's broker will take a smaller amount of cash e.g. $ 1 million as a deposit of capital and will then allow the hft to trade a larger amount of stock value long or short e.g. $ 10 million for 10:1 leverage that $ 1 million needs to be enough to cover the net profit loss when the trades settle and the broker will monitor this to ensure that deposit will be enough

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

the only advantage of changing all your money now to the new currency is that you might get a better conversion rate now than later so you get more of the new currency and you may pay a lower percentage fee for changing a larger sum of money however regarding the better conversion rate you will not know this except with hindsight the disadvantage of changing all at once is that if you have changed too much and need to change back to your own currency or a third currency you will be charged fees and lose on the conversion rate twice if you know how long you are going to be in the new country say 12 months maybe start by converting an amount you think you will be spending in a month if you spend more then you can change a bit more the next month or if you spend less change less the next month if you find you are spending similar amounts for the next month or so then you can budget on the amount you may be spending for the remainder of your stay and then convert this amount over if you have a little left over at the end of your stay maybe reward yourself with something or buy a present for someone special back at home if you need a little more just convert this amount in the last month or so

perhaps an example will help make it more clear any given year   revenue   200 k profit 60 k you get 40 k in profit plus any salary he gets 20 k next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell   you would get 100 of the proceeds this is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company 's profits and reduce his pay   for the given example you could pay yourself a 60 k bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation   there should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation edit it is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly   honesty in business is necessary for long term success   i would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates   for example lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10   your profit would be 6 and with the suggested split he would receive $ 2 you $ 4 instead i would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated this allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales   it also allows him to share revenue with his staff    alternatively you could also do a split   perhaps 7.5 of revenue and 10 of profit

you can claim a deduction only if all of your business is conducted from the home i.e. your home is your principal place of business not just if you work from home sometimes the cra canada revenue agency has pretty strict guidelines listed here but once you 're sure you qualify for a deduction the next step would be to determine what portion of your home qualifies    you can not attempt to deduct your entire mortgage simply because you run your business out of your home   the portion of your mortgage and other related allowable home expense deductions has to be pro rated to be equal to or less than the portion of your home you use for business   simply put if your business is operated out of a 120 sq ft self contained space and your home 's total square footage is 2400 sq ft you can deduct 5 of your expenses = 0.05 hope this helps

let me first start by defining an emergency fund this is money which is because emergency 's usually need to be deal with asap boiler breaks gears box in a car generally you need these to be solved as soon as possible because ou depend on these things working and you ca n't budget for this type of expenditure using just your monthly salary this is a personal opinion but i prefer investment types that do n't have another fee on access i really do n't like having another fee on top on money that i need right now investment options market based investments should be seen as long term investments therefore they do not really satisfy requirement one they can also have broker fees therefore you might pay a small extra charge for taking money out and so do not satisfy requirement two investment options for emergency funds you want to get the best return on your money even if it 's your emergency fund so use regular saving accounts but from you emergency fund or use tax effective savings accounts like a cash isa if based in the uk do n't think of an emergency money as just sitting there you have options just makes sure the options fit the requirements update given feedback i appreciate there are levels of emergency fund the above details things which might be about 1 2 month salary in cost car repairs leaks boiler repairs now i have another fund which is in p2p funds which is higher risk than a deposit account but then gives me a better return and is less subject to market fluctuations and it would be the place i go to for loss of job level emergencies say 6 months of salary this takes a bit longer to access but given i have the above emergency fund i have given myself time to get the money from the p2p account

i 've been in a similar situation before while contracting sometimes the recruiting agency would allow me to choose between being a w2 employee or invoicing them via i already had a company set up s corp but the considerations are similar typically the rate was higher than the w2 rate to account for the extra 7.65 fica taxes and insurance but there were a few times where the rate offered was identical and i still choose because it enabled me to deduct many of my business expenses that i would n't have otherwise been able to deduct in my case the deductions turned out to be greater than the fica savings your case is slightly different than mine though in that i already had the company set up so my company related costs were sunk as far as my decision was concerned for you though the yearly costs associated with running the business must be factored in for example suppose the following due to these expenses you need to make up $ in tax deductions due to the llc if your effective tax rate on the extra income is 30 then your break even point is approximately $ 8 k in deductions = > x = $ so with those made up numbers if you have at least $ 8 k in legitimate additional business expenses then it would make sense to form an llc otherwise you 'd be better off as a w2 other considerations

generally speaking if the acquiring company buys less than 50 of the target the acquirer would not claim any income until there was a dividend or the equity stock appreciated with a dividend the company would participate in and book earnings on the cash received without a dividend equity stock of the target should theoretically rise to reflect higher retained income and the acquirer would book an unrealized gain to gross profit i think if the acquiring company buys more than 50 of the target it is likely all revenues and would be consolidated and included in the acquiring company 's respective accounts as if it was one whole any residual stake in the target owned by a third party would be reflected in a minority interest expense on the acquiring company 's income statement

that 's definitely a good point thanks for noting that leverage was definitely an issue   re the ratings agencies i just wanted to clarify that i was talking about something a bit different than the problem of ratings shopping i assume this is what you meant what you mentioned the ratings agencies    ratings shopping is essentially the tendency for a race to the bottom in ratings when banks pay for ratings that has always been an issue for the ratings agencies since the 1970s i think when they started having the rated entities pay for their ratings    what i was talking about is more unique to the structured products industry in the i.e. how the ratings agencies gave banks an opportunity for essentially risk less profit by merely mbss into cdos so banks would buy up mbss them into cdos sell shares of the cdos to investors and then hedge all of the residual risk away by writing a cds contract with a insurer like aig this has more to do with the relationship between ratings for different products and not the absolute level of the ratings for any given product   sorry if that sounds nit picky but i think it 's an extremely important detail that is generally lost upon as you pointed out economists who are pushing the ratings shopping theory i would guess this is because moral hazard is a story they are already familiar with

as others have pointed out there are often many factors that are contributing to a stock 's movement other than the latest news   in particular the overall market sentiment and price movement very often is the primary driver in any stock 's change on a given day    but in this case i 'd say your anecdotal observation is correct all else equal announcements of layoffs tend to drive stock prices upwards here 's why to the public layoffs are almost always a sign that a company is willing to do whatever is needed to fix an already known and serious problem mass layoffs are brutally hard decisions   even at companies that go through cycles of them pretty regularly they 're still painful every time   there 's a strong personal drain on the chain of executives that has to decide who loses their livelihood   and even if you think most execs do n't care and i think you 'd be wrong it 's still incredibly distracting    the process takes many weeks during which productivity plummets and it 's to everyone when it happens so companies very rarely do it until they think they have to   by that point they are likely struggling with some very publicly known problems usually contracting or negative margins    so the market 's view of the company at the time just before layoffs occur is almost always this company has problems but is unable or unwilling to solve them   layoffs signal that both of those possibilities are incorrect   they suggest that the company believes that layoffs will fix the problem and that they 're willing to make hard calls to do so and that 's why they usually drive prices up

having dealt with with social security state agencies and banks more than i 'd care to i would urge you to do the following 1 get a 100 clear answer on whether or not you are listed as joint or authorized user signer for an account this will probably require a call to the bank but for less than an hour of you and your friend 's time you will save yourself a whole lot of hassle the difference is like this if you worked at a business that added you as an authorized user for a credit or debit card this would allow you to use the card to buy things but that does n't make the money in the bank yours on the other hand if you are listed as joint this regards ownership and it could become tricky to establish whether its your money or not to any governmental satisfaction 2 you are completely correct in being honest with the agency but that 's not enough if you do n't know what the facts are you ca n't really be honest with them if the form is unclear it 's ok to ask on having a bank account does being listed as an authorized user on someone else 's account count if it is n't my money or bank account but if you are listed as holding the account jointly that changes the question to i am listed as joint on someone else 's checking account but it is n't my money how is that considered to social security it might mean generating an extra form or it might mean you need to have the status on the account changed or they might not care but if you do n't get the facts first they wo n't give you the right answers or help you need and from personal experience it 's a heck of a lot easier to get a straight and clear answer from a bank than it is from a federal government agency have the facts with you when you contact them and you 'll be ok but trust me you do n't want them guessing

you can you can take out a conventional mortgage and keep the cash   a mortgage is nothing but a secured loan against your home you can open a heloc and treat it as a negative equity bank account note that both a mortgage and a heloc tend to have significant up front or administrative costs attached to them   it costs the loaning institution some money to ensure they are in a safe position and they will want to pass it on to you they do n't want you taking out such a loan and not using it on the other hand the interest rates on such a loan are often much lower than interest rates on other loans if you have a reliable source of significant income getting a completely unsecured line of credit may be possible with a rate only a few percentage points higher than a heloc without having to pay a cent in fees   the bank does n't have to appraise your home or ensure ownership before such a loan just assess income which is easy especially if you have a regular paycheck auto deposited into an account at the same branch toss in some signatures from your employer and good to go if that is feasible you could end up with a lower rate   withdraw from the line of credit pay off your other loans then work to repay the line of credit if an unsecured line of credit has a rate 1 3 higher than a secured one and you are borrowing 5000 $ against it and pay it off over 2 years the total interest you would save from a secured line is about note that in some jurisdictions your home is protected against loss from bankruptcy unless you have used it as collateral for a loan or it is easier to claim the home if you are insolvent if you have used it as collateral   determining what the consequences of securing your loan against the house could itself be expensive

market makers traders and value investors would be who i 'd suspect for buying the stock that is declining some companies stocks can come down considerably which could make some speculators buy the stock at the lower price thinking it may bounce back soon short sellers are out to sell borrowed stocks that if the stock is in free fall unless the person that shorted wants to close the position they would let it ride worthless stocks are a bit of a special case and quite different than the crash of 1929 where various blue chip stocks like those of the dow jones had severe declines thus the companies going down would be like apple coca cola and other large companies that people would be shocked to see come down so much yet there are some examples in recent history if one remembers enron or worldcom stocks getting delisted tend to cause some selling and there are some speculators may buy the stock believing that the shares may be worth something only to lose the money possibly as one could look at the bankrupt cases of airlines and car companies to study some recent cases here circuit breakers are worth noting as these are cases when trading may be halted because of a big swing in prices that it is believed stopping the market may cause things to settle down

there 's no reason for the employer not to deduct the whole amount before you leave the fsa salary deduction has to be periodical but it does n't have to be calculated over a year it just means that an equal amount will be deducted from your every paycheck and if the employer and you know that your last paycheck is on june 30th even before the year starts there 's nothing to stop the employer from calculating the periodic payments so that it will cover your full fsa amount before you leave that is of course other than mere convenience it may be easier cheaper to just give you the extra $ than to deal with the special case deduction calculation this is different from unexpected termination resignation where the employer could n't have made such an assumption and thus the periodic payments were calculated over a year see pub 969 the selection is annual the deductions are periodical

a real simple definition or analogy of present value would be the principal or loan amount being lent and the future value as being returning the principal along with cost of borrowing the is the interest you earn on present value the is the interest you pay on future value the first one is the or future value of a $ 1 the second one is the or present value of a $ 1 both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time this entails here e is the 's e   thus the interest factors turn to this the examples only considered a single repayment at future date now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $ 1 for n number of periods then the present value of all such periodic payment is the principal or amount you borrowed this is the sum of discounted periodic payments as   if we replace with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form this simplifies to   replacing for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $ 1 the future value of periodic payments in amount of $ 1 can be arrived at multiplying the by giving once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield to use as the effect rate is the and calculation for continuous compounding all the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of then the present value of a $ 1 would be as follow once again you would have to use if compounding frequency of interest is intra year now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount q per period to find the present value of series of payments p that increase or decrease per period by an amount q we would do the following calculations here and all of these calculations have been available in add in for finance and incrementally being offered as javascript financial functions library please note that the tad series of the financial functions library for various environments such as excel javascript php ruby and others are property of the author writing this post all of these libraries except one for excel are available for free for public use and the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the pv by as follows here

i have been careful here to cover both shares in companies and in etfs exchange traded funds some information such as around corporate actions and is only applicable for company shares and not etfs the shares that you own are registered to you through the broker that you bought them via but are verified by independent fund administrators and brokerage reconciliation processes this means that there is independent verification that the broker has those shares and that they are ring as being yours the important point in this is that the broker can not sell them for their own profit or otherwise use them for their own benefit such as for collateral against margin etc   1 since the broker is keeping the shares for you they are still acting as an intermediary in order to prove that you own the shares and have the right to sell them you need to transfer the registration to another broker in order to sell them through that broker this typically but not always involves some kind of fee and the broker that you transfer to will need to be able to hold and deal in those shares not all brokers have access to all markets 2 you can sell your shares through a different broker to the one you bought them through but you will need to transfer your ownership to the other broker and that broker will need to have access to that market 3 you will normally depending on your broker get an email or other message on settlement which can be around two days after your purchase you should also be able to see them in your online account ui before settlement you usually do n't get any messages from the issuing entity for the instrument until agm time when you may get invited to the agm if you hold enough stock all other corporate actions should be handled for you by your broker it is rare that settlement does not go through on well regulated markets such as european hong kong japanese and us markets but this is more common on other markets in particular i have seen quite a lot of trades reversed on the market recently that is not to say that is unsafe its just that i happen to have seen a few trades reversed recently

basically the balance you see in your account is the amount of money you currently have a right to based on the fact that you have deposited it with the bank you can of course take this money out pretty well whenever you like or move it however you like however your bank account is not physical money the currency you is and used as the bank sees fit your account is simply a statement keeping track of how much money the bank is holding for you    the banks ability to use deposited funds to make money relies on the fundamental assumption that not everyone is going to withdraw all of there deposited funds at once all banks will have legislated liquidity requirements how much money needs to be kept in cash or near cash securities short term interest bearing paper basically in order to allow for pretty much any reasonable number of people to withdraw any amount of money additionally the bank as you said makes money on its loans securities trading and investment banking activities that money belongs to the bank and gives them even more money to play around with   obviously there have historically been instances in which bank runs occur everyone tries to withdraw all there money at once bank have enough liquid assets to pay or cases in which a bank experiences solvency issues for other reasons having to pay out poorly thought out speculative securities transactions re north american housing crash in 2008 in these cases there are consumer protection agencies that insure financial institutions against insolvency varies by country but under most normal circumstances the bank uses some portion of deposited funds to make money and has systems in place to ensure an individual person can access there deposited funds as needed    tldr account statement just shows how much money you have given the bank and can thus claim back from them in the form of withdraw bank has legally dictated cash reserve percentage to allow for everyone to withdraw money when they need it under most normal circumstances

credit cards are meant to be used so generally it does n't hurt your credit score to use them   to top it off you even get an interest grace period so you do n't have to rush home and pay balances as soon as they 're charged    in general you accrue charges during your statement period we 'll call it september 1 through september 30   the statement due date is something like 20 days after the close of the statement period so we 'll call it october 20   as long as you pay your entire statement balance by the due date you will never pay interest   you charge your laptop on september 3 it shows up on your statement as $ 1,300 you pay $ 1,300 on october 18 you pay no interest however if you pay $ 1,000 on october 18 leaving a $ 300 balance to be carried in to the next statement period a carried balance you will pay interest   generally interest is calculated based on your average daily balance during the statement period which is now be the october 1 to october 31 period   you 'll notice that you did n't pay anything until the october 18 that means the entire $ 1,300 will be included in your average daily balance up to the 18th of the month   add to that anything else you charge on the card now will be included in your average daily balance for interest charge calculation purposes the moral of the story is use your card and pay your entire statement balance before the due date    now how much will this impact your credit score   it 's tough to say   utilization is not a bad thing until it 's a big number   i 've read that 70 utilization and over is really the point at which lenders will raise an and under 30 is considered excellent if you have one card and $ 1,300 is a significant portion of your available limit then yes you should probably pay it down quickly   spend six or so months using the card and paying it then call your bank and ask for a credit line increase

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

depending on where you live in the uk buying a house sooner might be a better option i would echo the advice about putting some money away into a rainy day fund etc above but i know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7 per year i bought a house two years ago and i 'm paying 4 interest on my mortgage so i 'm effectively making money by owning my house   given that you want to buy a house if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest you 're effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices meaning you 'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £ 4k in lawyers fees surveys mortgage setup fees etc and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a of the sale cost if you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. london where house prices are currently skyrocketing if you do n't want to live in the house you may be able to do a buy to let as an investment generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent property management company 's fees so while you wo n't see any actual net income the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you 'll be building equity on the home it 's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

if you want to prove the actual tax liability you have in the us you have to file a tax return if the government believes you that the withholding is your actual tax fine but that would be a lie withholding is not a tax the american payers must withhold from foreigners enough to have transferred more than the actual tax the foreigners would have paid the standard withholding is 30 but the actual tax on dividends varies in case the tax treaty limits the tax on dividends the withholding is usually up to the maximum of the tax allowed by the treaty but allowed does n't mean that would be the actual tax in many cases it is not so if you want to claim the us tax paid as a credit towards your tax you 'll need to file a tax return in the us calculate the actual tax liability and that would be the amount of credit you can claim the difference between that amount and the amount withheld by the payer will be refunded to you by the irs you do n't have to file a us tax return that is true but the withholding is not the tax the actual tax liability may have been less and the tax authority may deny your credit in whole or in part based on the fact that you have n't filed a us tax return and as such have no proof of your actual tax paid you had some experience with the uk tax treaty and you think all the treaties are the same that may be a reasonable line of thought but it is incorrect treaties are not the same more importantly even if the treaty is the same the tax law is not while in the uk the tax on dividends may be flat and from the first pound in the us it is neither flat nor from the first dollar thus while in the uk you may have been used to paying tax at source and that 's it in the us it does n't work that way at all

i think the issue you are having is that the option value is not a flow but rather a liability that changes value over time it is best to illustrate with a balance sheet the $ 33 dollars would be the premium net of expense that you would receive from your brokerage for having shorted the options this would be your asset the liability is the right for the option owner the person you sold it to to exercise and purchase stock at a fixed price at the moment you sold it the marked to market value of that option is $ 40 hence you are at a net account value of $ $ which is the commission over time as the price of that option changes the value of your account is simply $ 33 since each option contract is for 100 shares in your example above this implies that the option price is 20 cents so if i were to redo the chart it would look like this if the next day the option value goes to 21 cents your liability would now be = $ 42 dollars in a sense 2 dollars have been debited from your account to cover your potential liability since you also own the stock there will be a credit from that line item not shown at the expiry of your option since you are selling covered calls if you were to be exercised on the loss on the option and the gain on the shares you own will net off the final cost basis of the shares you sold will be adjusted by the premium you 've received you will simply be selling your shares at strike + premium per share 0.20 cents in this example

of course there can always be some ways you can integrate some amounts of social responsibility into product but i do n't think that 's the point he 's making social responsibility would be called business best practice if it improved the bottom line it is inevitable that there are times when social responsibility and business goals diverge and at that point given two companies that are in the same market space the one who bets against society will win this is the sort of thing that must be handled in law and absolutely can not be handled by allowing the free market to work because the free market will not discover ethics it will discover that ethics do n't matter in an environment that does n't require them     it 's the reason any claim that business does best when there are no regulations is absolutely false if a company can make more by polluting and you do n't have regulation that says clearly it may cost more but we require you to compete by also being non then you should expect the market to converge on pollution as best practice   removing regulation wo n't allow business to sort this out it will allow business to not care that they are polluting   there is the notion of a b corp that is organized for the purpose of trying to be good guys without being sued but it does n't assure that they will have a fair stake int he market   it just allows them to fail without getting sued by stock holders   basically if everyone is not required to be that level of good guy though b corps are basically indulging unilateral sure they can make a case that ethics matter and that might work but they do n't need b corp protection for that if making the case that ethics matter was going to win in the market any corporation could do it   for more thoughts so i do n't have to drone on here see my articles fiduciary duty vs. the three laws of duty vs three laws of and losing the war in a quiet war in quiet

considering that i ca n't find anything on chase 's web site referencing a money market ira i suspect that this is a type of account that they are n't actively supporting anymore but are n't forcing you to cash it in   i would call chase to find out for sure however that said a money market is not a good investment if you are looking for any kind of growth   they are basically a savings account that pay currently a small amount of interest   you can get much better return from other low risk investments   you can rebalance periodically if you want to keep a certain amount of cash available

can is fine and other answered that i 'd suggest that you consider the should does your employer offer a matched retirement account typically a 401(k are you depositing up to the match   do you have any higher interest short term debt credit cards car loan student loan etc   do you have 6 months worth of living expenses in liquid funds   one point i like to beat a dead horse over is this for most normal mortgages the extra you pay goes to principal but regardless of how much extra you pay the next payment is still due next month so it 's possible that you are feeling pretty good that for 5 years you pay so much that you have just 10 left on the 30 year loan but if you lose your job you still risk losing the house to foreclosure it 's not like you can ask the bank for that money back   if you are as disciplined as you sound put the extra money aside and only when you have well over the recommended 6 months then make those prepayments if you choose   to pull my comment to into my answer i avoided this aspect of the discussion but here i 'll suggest that a 4 mortgage costs 3 after tax in 25 bracket and i 'd bet cap gain rates will stay 15 for so with the break even return of 3.5 to return 3 after tax and dvy yielding 3.33 the questions becomes do you think the dvy top will be flat over the next 15 years any return over is profit that said the truly risk averse should heed the advise in original answer then pre pay update when asked in april 2012 the dvy i suggested as an example of an investment that beats the mortgage cost traded at $ 56 it 's now $ 83 and still yields to put numbers to this a lump sum $ 100 k would be worth $ k this does n't include dividends and giving off $ in dividends for an after tax $ we happened to have a good 4 years overall the time horizon 15 years makes the strategy low risk if one sticks to it

really all you need to know is that american style can be exercised at any point european options can not be exercised early read on if you want more detail   the american style call is worth more because it can be exercised at any point and when the company pays a dividend and your option is in the money if the extrinsic value is worth less than the dividend you can be exercised early this is not the case for a european call you can not be exercised until expiration i trade a lot of options you wo nt be exercised early unless the dividend scenario i mentioned happens or unless the extrinsic value is nothing but even then unless the investor really wants that position he is more likely to just sell the call for an equivalent gain on 100 shares of stock

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

note specific to uk i ca n't recommend anything higher than crunch they act as your accountant and have their own cloud accounting software so it 's more expensive than just using cloud accounting software but if you use an accountant to do your year end anyway then they cost about the same as using cloud accounting software plus using an accountant to do your year end the thing i like as a software development contractor is that i do n't have to know or worry about different ledger accounts or journal entries or any of the other weird accounting things etc most cloud accounting software claim to simplify accounting so that you can concentrate on running your business whereas the reality is that you still have to spend ages learning how to be an accountant just to fill it in correctly with crunch that 's actually true it does actually make it simple i 've used crunch sage and xero so my sample set is n't very big just thought i 'd share my experiences if you value your time and get annoyed by having to create multiple internal transfers between different ledgers just to do something simple it 's for you this probably sounds like a sales pitch but i have nothing to do with them and nothing to gain by recommending them the only reason i 'm so passionate is i started a new business to do an online shop and tried to use crunch but they do n't do retail businesses only contractors freelancers or simple service based businesses their software is geared up specifically for that which i guess is why it 's more simple than the others anyway so now i 'm annoyed at having to use the more complicated ones

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

stock has value to the buyer even if it does not currently pay dividends since it is part ownership of the company and the company 's assets the owners of which you are now a part hire managers to make a dividend policy decision   if the company can reinvest the profits into a project that would earn more than the minimum acceptable rate of return then they should do so if the company has no internal investment opportunities at or above this desired rate then the company has an obligation to declare a dividend   paying out a dividend returns this portion of profit to the owners who can then invest their money elsewhere and earn more for example the stock market currently has say a 5 rate of return company a has a $ 1 m profit and can invest it in a project with an expected 10 rate of return so they should do so company b has a $ 1 m profit but their best internal project only has an expected 2 rate of return   it is in the owners best interest to receive their portion of their company 's profit as a dividend and re invest it in other stocks others have pointed out the tax portion of dividend policy so i skipped that

you can try paper trading to your investing stocks to invest how much money to allocate and stuff but nothing compares to getting beaten black and blue in the real world when virtual money is involved you may n't care because you do n't loose anything but when your hard earned money disappears or grows no paper trading can those feelings in you so there is no guarantee that doing paper trading will make you a better investor but can help you a lot in terms of learning secondly educate yourself on the ways of investing it is hard work and realize that there is no substitute for hard work india is a growing economy and your friends maybe safe in the short term but take it from any investor not in the long run and moreover as all economies are recovering from the recession there are ample opportunities to invest money in india both good and bad calculate your returns and compare it with your friends maybe a year or two down the lane to compare the returns generated from both sides maybe they would come trumps but remember selecting a good investment from a bad investment will surely pay out in the long run   not sure what you do not understand what buffet says it can not get more simpler than that if you can drill those rules into your blood you may n't become a billionaire but surely you will make a killing but in the long run read and read as much as you can buy books browse the net this might help one more guy like you

having recently been given basically the same question it hinges on a few major factors what does your apartment provide e.g. heating internet etc my personal example with my numbers which includes taxes insurance estimates minor repairs to home as needed also ignoring all costs that are shared e.g. food internet car insurance etc i am only making a difference around $ 450 per month in 5 years i would save $ 450 12 5 $ 27,000 however i also have to pay costs for buying the house transfer deed fees home inspections etc which in my case cost around $ 3000 not to mention selling a home has some costs i think around $ 1500 + in my area as well as the taking a cut which i also think is around 2.5 = $ so we can probably estimate you would lose around $ 15000 at most buying and selling the home when all final costs come in which means in my case i would at most be saving around $ 12,000 probably less assuming i did not miss anything so basically 5 = $ 200 per month saved tldr i do n't think its worthwhile because there is a lot of risks involved and houses tend to require a lot of extra work money with apartments you have little no risk and can freely leave at the end

all openly traded securities must be registered with the sec and setup with clearing agents   this is a costly process the cost to provide an electronic market for a specific security is negligible   that is why the exchange fees per electronic trade are so small per security   it is so small in fact that exchanges compensate price makers partially at the expense of price takers that exchanges partially give some portion of the overall fee to those that can help provide liquidity the cost to provide an open outcry market for a specific security are somewhat onerous but they are initiated before a security has any continual liquidity to provide a market for large trades especially for futures every individual option contract must be registered and setup for clearing aside from the cost to setup each contract expiration and strike intervals are limited by regulation   for an extremely liquid security like spy contracts could be offered for daily expiration and penny strike intervals but they are currently forbidden

it 's a good point to make with bot presence for the most part twitter is made of people even if there are a lot of false or bot accounts that being said i do n't find it as strong a marketing channel because of the nature of twitter at its core    if you follow 1000 people you 're likely to have nearly 10,000 tweets going through your feed it 's hard to really fight for attention but you can still get decent response and views when done right    as for instagram   i think in the long term just as any other social network the lifespan of it depends on the content as long as people are having new experiences and taking photos of them there will always be more content    that being said there are tons of accounts that pretty much post the same content it things like the explore feature because they 're using less than kosher tactics to get likes    ultimately i think policing of instagram as they have been is the best strategy for keeping it going    even though i 'm a marketer i 'm also a millennial with pretty typical values blatant advertising is annoying and intrusive when it comes to user experience and many young people today feel that way    by policing things like auto engaging false locations you used to be able to just type locations like follow me and being very keen on following through with reports of spam accounts is a good way to keep younger people on it    unless you 're paying for ads marketing on instagram typically consists of native content that looks good on feeds and needs engagement to rise up this is a good way to curb marketing while still maintaining a good user experience    as a side note part of why i use snapchat less is how they shove ads down your throat which gets old pretty fast ads on snapchat pretty much ruined the platform for me personally aside from using it for communication    as long as instagram maintains this balance based around the user and not the advertisers i think it will be going for quite some time

many of the bitcoin exchanges mimic stock exchanges though they 're much more rudimentary offering only simple buy sell cancel orders   it 's fairly normal for retail stock brokerage accounts to allow other sorts of more complex orders where once a certain criteria is met the price falls below some $ threshold or has a movement greater than some then your order is executed   the space between the current buy order and the current sell order is the bid ask spread it 's not really about timing   person x will buy at $ 100 person y will sell at $ 102   if both had a price set at $ 101 they would just transact   both parties think they can do a little bit better than the current offer   the width of the bid ask spread is not universal by any means   the current highest buy order and the current lowest sell order are both the current price   the current quoted market price is generally the price of the last transaction whether it 's buy or sell

i actually love this question and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself there some obvious touch points most people do n't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $ 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios there are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your as you get near retirement age index funds are not touted as categorically the best investment they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest there is still a management component to an index like the s&p500   the index does n't simply buy a share of apple and watch it over time   the s&p 500 is n't simply a single share of each of the 500 us companies it 's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes   voo makes a lot of trades every day to track the s&p index passive index investing is almost an oxymoron the most obvious part of this is that if index funds were the best way to invest money berkshire hathaway would be 100 invested in voo   the argument for passive index investing is simplified for public consumption   the reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under performed the large index funds net of fees   in part the of the advice is that the average person is or should be more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings   investment professionals generally want to avoid how come i my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7   if you track the index you wo n't do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night in my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $ 0 making investment decisions and $ 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold   they simply track an index xyz company is 0.07 of the index then the fund carries 0.07 of xyz even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there the argument for a majority of your funds residing in mutual funds etfs is simple when you 're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should i sell a share of amazon or a share of exxon   would n't you rather just sell 2 units of index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission   for this simplicity you give up three basis points   it seems pretty reasonable to me

plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for i disagree with as a current college student i would say to take out loans most of the time i am against loans though   so why there are very few times you will receive loans at 0 interest for 4 + years you have money saved currently but you do not know what the future entails if you expend all of your money on tuition and your car breaks down what do you do you can not used student loans to pay for your broken car student loans as long as they are subsidized serve as a wonderful risk buffer you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit with an additional caveat being to get a credit card in general debt loans credit cards are non beneficial but you have to establish debt to allow others to know that you can repay establishing this credit rating earlier than later is critical to cheaper interest rates on say a mortgage   you have made it through you have watched your expenses and you can pay your debt finish it if you do it right you will not have loans when you graduate you will have a stunning credit rating and you will have enjoyed college to its fullest potential remember you only really go through it once but this is contingent on   good luck   edit i did not realize the implication of this penalty which made me edit the line above to include to the extent you can per year for now student loan repayment is n't considered a qualified educational expense this means that if you withdraw from a 529 to pay your debts you may be subject to income taxes and penalties source furthermore   currently taxpayers who use 529 plan money for anything other than qualified education expenses are subject to a 10 federal tax penalty source my advice with this new knowledge save your 529 if you plan on continuing higher education at a more prestigious school if you do not use it later in your undergraduate years

most of stock trading occurs on what is called a secondary market for example microsoft is traded on nasdaq which is a stock exchange an analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car when you sell a used car to a third person the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading still within the same analogy when the car is first sold money goes directly to the maker actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes in the case of stock trading this is called an initial public offering ipo seasoned public offering for most purposes what this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential let me add some nuance to this say this drop from 20 $ to 10 $ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity stock in the future it is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1 have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2 obtain less financing overall this could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing one last note in any case financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital i.e. interest paid because it is neither revenue nor expense financing obtained from debt increases assets cash and liabilities debt and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets cash and shareholder equity

sounds like a terrible situation the only thing i can think of if you have the cash for it is to pay down enough of the mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses on the one hand this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now on the other hand every time you make an interest payment you are burning the smaller amount of money with no hope of seeing it back ever if you do n't have the cash or you find that just throwing away money then i would get out as fast as i can every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest if you sold at $ 300,000 you would have only a $ 30,000 debt to manage the total amount it would take to pay that off at anything resembling normal interest rates would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing of course if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on then you might want to hold on personally i would not make that bet all around a terrible situation i wish you lots of luck in resolving it

prop proprietary traders trade using huge amounts of a bank 's money i.e. other people 's money so the reason why they have such low commissions and they certainly do is that the firms for which they work negotiate low commissions as the quantities and volumes as they also trade very frequently will be high and so the total commission will be very high there is no such thing as a prop trading account unless you are a big bank with a very large bank roll tens of millions of usd so you can not open one to enjoy those benefits unless you have enough money that you can negotiate your commission with brokers 25k cad is definitely not enough money to even start a conversation about those sorts of commissions note prop traders are generally banned from trading intraday with their own money by their employers and the law as it is a massive conflict of interests those who do and get caught face lengthy prison sentences

real estate potentially has two components of profit the increase in value and the ongoing returns similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends    it 's possible to buy both badly and in the case of stocks there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent   real estate is not a homogeneous asset class a $ 200 k house renting for $ 1,000 is a far different investment than a $ 100 k 3 family renting for $ 2,000 total rents both exist depending on the part of the country you are in   if you simply divide the price to the rent you get either or this is an oversimplification and of course interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another it 's safe to say that at any given time the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high a bargain or somewhere in between   as one article suggests the median price tracks inflation pretty closely and i 'd add that median home prices would track median income long term   to circle back yes real estate can be a good investment if you buy right find good tenants and are willing to put in the time   note buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision the home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should and turn their own profit into a loss e.g. a buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $ 150 k house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent the bank the spouse the extra cost of the $ 225 k house is the 1/3 more cost of repair utilities interest etc it 's identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment but grabbing one that 's 1500 sq ft for the view

as a non medical person i think it would be difficult to look at a list of services treatments surgeries and drug costs and figure out in advance which providers i would go to it would definitely be impossible if i were unexpectedly sick or injured that 's why it would be much easier to have a single payer system to negotiate all those prices after all we do n't individually have to figure out the best private company from which to buy fire department or police services or roads and it seems to work out ok and there is n't any middleman to drive up prices

in this case can the title of the home still be held by both yes it is possible to have additional people on title that are not on the mortgage would the lender bank have any reservations about this since a party not on the mortgage has ownership of the property possibly but there is a very simple way to avoid this clayton could simply purchase the home himself and add emma to the title after closing by recording a quitclaim deed the lender ca n't stop that and from their point of view it 's actually better since they have two people to go after in the case of default but despite it being better they often make it difficult to purchase tip when you have an attorney draft the quitclaim document have them draft the reverse document too emma the property back to clayton there is usually no extra charge for this and then you have it if you need it for example you may need to file the reverse forms if you want to refinance as a side note i agree with   grade eh bacon 's and pete b. 's in recommending that clayton and emma do not do this once they are married the property will either be automatically jointly owned or a spouse can be added to the title easily and until they are married there are no pros but many cons to doing this reasons not to do it as a side note in a comment it was proposed suppose clayton loves emma so much that he wants her name to be on the house i understand the desire to do this from an emotional point of view but realize this does not make sense from a financial point of view

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up during the time between earnings announcements analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company including their estimate of the company 's value and future earnings and as part of an earnings report companies often include guidance their prediction for the upcoming quarter this will frequently be a conservative estimate so they 're more likely to achieve it investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information when the earnings report comes out investors compare these actual returns to analysts predictions and the company 's guidance if their results are in line with these predictions the stock price is unlikely to move much as those results are already incorporated into the stock price if the company is doing better than predicted it 's usually a good sign and the price often rises conversely if it 's doing worse the price will likely fall but it 's not as simple as this as others have explained for long term investors stock prices are based on expectations of future activity if the results of that quarter include some one time actions that are unlikely to repeat investors will often discount that portion

the principal of the contribution can definitely be withdrawn tax free and penalty free however there is a section that makes me think that the earnings part may be subject to penalty in addition to tax in publication under traditional iras > when can you withdraw or use assets > contributions returned before due date of return > early distributions tax it says the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59½    does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions    however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported    on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to    the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax this section is only specifically about the return of contributions before the due date of return not a general withdrawal as you can see from the first sentence that the penalty does n't apply to contributions which would n't be true of general withdrawals therefore the second sentence must be about the earnings part of the withdrawal that you must make together with the contribution part as part of the return of contributions before the due date of the return if the penalty it is talking about is only about other types of withdrawals and does n't apply to the earnings part of the return of contribution before the due date of the return then this sentence would n't make sense as it 's in a part that 's only about return of contribution before the due date of the return

let 's start with income $ $ the 28/36 rule suggests you can pay up to $ for the mortgage payment and $ total debt load payment on the full $ 260 k is $ well within the numbers the 401(k loan for $ 12,500 will cost about $ i used 4 for 10 years the limit for the loan to buy a house but that will also take the mortgage number down a bit   the condo fee is low and the numbers leave my only concern with the down payment have you talked to the bank most loans charge pmi if more than 80 loan to value ltv an important point here the 28/36 rule allows for 8 or more to be other than house debt so in this case a $ student loan payment would n't have impacted the ability to borrow when looking for a mortgage you really want to be free of most debt but not to the point where you have no down payment   pmi can be expensive when viewed that it 's an expense to carry the top 15 or so of the mortgage try to avoid it the idea of a split mortgage 80 + 15 makes sense even if the 15 portion is at a higher rate let us know what the bank is offering   i like the idea of the roommate if $ 700 is reasonable it makes the numbers even better does the roommate have access to a lump sum of money $ 700 24 is $ 16,800 tell him you 'll discount the rent to $ 15000 if he gives you it in advance this is 10 which is a great return with rates so low to you it 's an extra 5 down by the way the ratio of mortgage to income is n't fixed of the 28 let 's knock off 4 for tax insurance so a $ 100 k earner will have $ for just the mortgage at 6 it will fund $ k at 5 $ 404 k at 4.5 $ so the range varies but is within your 3 5 your ratio is below the low end so again i 'd say the concern should be the payments but the downpayment being so low   by the way taxes if i recall correctly utah 's state income tax is 5 right so about $ 4000 for you since the standard deduction on federal taxes is $ 5800 this year you probably do n't itemize unless you donate over $ 2k yr in which case you do this means that your mortgage interest and property tax are nearly all deductible the combined interest and property tax will be about $ 17 k which in effect will come off the top of your income you 'll start as if you made $ 63 k or so can you live on that

i would have to disagree with the other responders in technical analysis of stock charts various short and long term moving averages are used to give an indication of the trend of the stock in the short and long term as compared to the current price i would prefer to use the term moving average ma rather than average as the ma is recalculated every day or at appropriate frequencies for your data on the period you are using i would also expand on the term moving average there are two that are commonly used going back to the question of the value of this number for example if the current price is above the 200 day and also above the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending upwards conversely if current price is below the 200 day and also below the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending downwards these numbers are chosen on the basis of the market you are trading in the volatility and other factors for another example of how a number of moving averages are used together please have a read of 's multiple moving average though this does not use moving averages as large as 200 days

generally speaking you are not allowed to falsely represent models in a material way with a general model release for example you ca n't take a stock photo and put them in an ad that says i support puppy mills making it look as though the model in question holds such a political view   sexual misrepresentation is covered under this as well so this model definitely has a case that her image was misused the same would not apply to statements generally not considered sensitive like shop at safeway or dr. gives great smiles as long as they do not appear to be quotes from the model    beyond such legal shenanigans however a large multinational corporation such as burger king should really be hiring their own model for an ad campaign such as this who knows exactly what she is getting into simply as a matter of responsibility and good taste it is n't good pr to choose some poor individual and misuse them in a way they find since you can certainly find a model who would sign on for such a campaign in good faith

there are in fact two balances kept for your account by most banks that have to comply with common convenience banking laws   the first is your actual balance it is simply the sum total of all deposits and withdrawals that have cleared the account that is both your bank and the bank from which the deposit came or to which the payment will go have exchanged necessary proof of authorization from the payor and have confirmed with each other that the money has actually been debited from the account of the payor transferred between the banks and credited to the account of the payee   the second balance is the available balance this is the actual balance plus any amount that the bank is floating you while a deposit clears minus any amount that the bank has received notice of that you may have just authorized but for which either full proof of authorization or the definite amount or both have not been confirmed this is what 's happening here your bank received notice that you intended to pay the train company $ x. they put an authorization hold on that $ x deducting it from your available balance but not your actual balance the bank then for whatever reason declined to process the actual transaction insufficient funds suspicion of theft fraud but kept the hold in place in case the transaction was re attempted holds for debit purchases usually expire between 1 and 5 days after being placed if the hold is not subsequently settled by the merchant providing definite proof of amount and authorization before that time the expiration time mainly depends on the policy of the bank holding your account holds can remain in place as long as thirty days for certain accounts or types of payment again depending on bank policy in certain circumstances the bank can remove a hold on request but it is the bank and not the merchant that you must contact to remove a hold or even inquire about one

your are mixing multiple questions with assertions which may or may not be true so i 'll take a stab at this comment if it does n't make sense to you to answer the question in the title you invest in an ira because you want to save money to allow you to retire the government provides you with tax incentives that make an ira an excellent vehicle to do this the rules regarding ira tax treatment provide disincentives through tax penalties for withdrawing money before retirement this topic is covered dozens of times so search around for more detail regarding your desire to invest in items with high intrinsic value i would argue that gold and silver are not good vehicles for doing this intrinsic value does n't mean what you want it to mean in this context gold and silver are commodities whose prices fluctuate dramatically   if you want to grow money for retirement over a long period of time you should be invested in diversified collection of investments and precious metals should be a relatively small part of your portfolio

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

i 'd be concerned about using cds or other non liquid source for your emergency fund because you become likely to use debt instead of tapping your emergency fund because you are worried about penalties which typically only affect interest this mind set can make you loan the bank money at 1 2 buy a cd and borrow money from the bank at 18 25 credit card do n't create psychological barriers to using your emergency fund in a true emergency also you recommend 3 8 months of expenses   the purpose of an emergency fund is to cover both a loss of income for 3 8 months or a one time large expense new roof new sewer pipe to the house etc    a tiered solution solves the loss of income solution but does not readily address the need for a one time large emergency   i 'd keep all of your emergency fund liquid

gt;do you think that someone like gm does not create any indirect jobs gm is basically just a final of components made by others   during it 's peak employment years gm largely owned and manufactured the vast majority of it 's own components   of course there were still a lot of raw materials suppliers as well as minor component suppliers but the gm of 1970 was a far different and much more vertically integrated operation than it was just a decade or two later   the comment about worldwide employment misses the mark here the west is outsourcing our manufacturing   yes but you need to dig deeper than cheap labor for the reasons why a lot of it has to do with the post 1971 fiat dollar and the advent of leveraging everything in sight in part as an absurd inflation hedge and in part because finance saw a way of profiteering off the sale of the assets selling the farms out from underneath the farmers so to speak and subsequently firms needed to make substantially more than their previous profit margins in order to cover the interest costs etc   gt;we on the other hand are doing the opposite we 're going to end up with no middle class the only jobs available here will be for a small number of very highly specialized skills like hedge fund managers and the people who mow their lawns   no eventually the dollar will either become so watered down if it does n't collapse entirely along with an increase in the cost of overseas labor and a rising expense of goods transport in many ways only possible on large bulk scales will create a different scenario one in which manufacturing which has not entirely left the us by any means will stage a comeback but it will be a long slow climb back and we are probably a decade or more before the tide turns

i have been following some of these threads some of them are really old i have read used recording to equity accounts to resolve the imbalance usd issue the thing i noticed is that all my imbalances occur when paying bills i took all the bills and set them up as vendor accounts entered the bills in the new bills and used the process payment when paying bills the imbalance issue stopped it makes sense the system is a double entry that 's it will credit and debit assets accounts are increased with a debit and decreased with a credit equity accounts are increased with a credit and decreased with a debit ie say you have an monthly insurance bill for $ 100 you enter it into the new vendor bill this credits accounts payable when paying the bill it credits checking debits account payable credits vendor account debits the expense insurance in short for each credit there has to be a debit for the books to balance when there is no account for it to record to it will record in imbalance usd to balance the books

your post has some assumptions that are not or may not be true for one the assumption is that you have to wait 7 years after you settle your debts to buy a home   that is not the case   for some people me included settling an charged off debt was part of my mortgage application process   it was a small debt that a doctor 's office claimed i owed but i did n't   the mortgage company told me settling the debt was the cost of doing business   settling your debts can be looked as favorable option 1 in my opinion is akin to stealing   you borrowed the money and you are seeking to game the system by not paying your debts   would you want someone to do that to you   iirc the debt can be sold to another company and the time period is refreshed and can stay on your credit report for beyond the 7 years   i could be wrong but i feel like there is a way for potential lenders to see accounts well beyond specified time periods   after all the lenders are the credit reporting agencies customers and they seek to provide the most accurate view of a potential lender   with 20 k of cc debt they should point that out to their customers option 2   do you have 20 k   i 'd still seek to settle you do not have to wait 7 years    your home may not appreciate in 2 years   in my own case my home has very little in the 11 years that i have owned it   many people have learned the hard way that homes do not necessarily increase in value    it is very possible that you may have a net loss in equity in two years   repairs or improvements can evaporate the small amount of equity that is achieved over two years with a 30 year mortgage    i would hope that you pause a bit at the fact that you defaulted on 20 k in debt   that is a lot of money   although it is a lot it is a small amount in comparison to the cost and maintenance of a home   are you prepared to handle such a responsibility   what has changed in your personality since the 20 k default   the tone of your posts suggests you are headed for the same sort of calamity this is far more than a numbers game it is behavioral

weird from the bad old days when you had to do arithmetic by hand i would guess   stocks used to trade in so bonds trading in even smaller increments makes sense   also and i am unsure if this is still true u.s. bonds trade on a 360 day year or used to anyway for the same reason 360 divides well into months and quarters for easier math whereas 365 is considerably harder   most of the world now trades in and years so i am unsure why the u.s. does n't   institutional inertia i would guess

as michael pryor answered a bond fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds i 'd also consider an etf based on bonds to be a bond fund but i 'm not sure that all investors would consider these as bond funds not all bond funds are the same just like stock funds you can classify bond funds based on the issuer of the bonds you can also classify funds based on the time to maturity in general bond funds have lower risk and lower expected return than stock funds sometimes bond funds have price movements that are not tightly correlated to the price movements in the equity markets this can make them a decent hedge against declines in your equity investments see pryor 's answer for some info on how you can get tax free treatment for your bond fund investments

when obama took office the yearly deficit was $ 1.6 trillion   when he left office it was only $ 600 billion   yes the total debt continued to increase because he never got the deficit down to zero like the last democratic president clinton did but he made a lot of progress   in fact the only time we 've seen the yearly deficit decrease is when a democrat is in the white house   unfortunately trump seems determined to reverse that trend   he wants a tax cut a wall which he now demands congress pay for a roughly 10 increase in the military budget and a $ 1 trillion dollar infrastructure spend fest   odds are the next democratic president will have to start digging us out of that hole

states have made sales tax more confusing by expanding some categories and shrinking or eliminating other categories in days of old there were taxes on items and specific taxes on other small categories such as fuel and in many states there were taxes implemented state wide and in other cases they only applied to a specific city or region as time went on taxes could be raised to bring in more money for the state or local government but these tax increase were seen as unfair to the poor so now the states are modifying and tweaking the tax rates some items are tax free some have a low tax and some are at the full tax rate this can get confusing because the type of store can also play a factor a bag a chips from a grocery store can be treated   differently than a bag of chips from a stand some states have also added special taxes on snack foods in general purchases they want to encourage staples from the grocery store are tax free or low tax items they do n't want to encourage snacks are fully taxed you can also be sure that they will treat luxury items as fully taxed a new frontier of taxation are ones designed to tax people who do n't live there they have added taxes on restaurants and   hotels since they are paid by tourists the people most likely to pay them do n't have a voice in setting the rate   states are now wanting to tax services as a way to make up shortfalls in taxing   do n't expect consistency from state to state or year to year   oh by the way that penny tax was for something that cost 17 cents or less unless that item had a lower tax rate the receipt should clearly identify the taxable items and their tax level

as a new graduate aside from the fact that you seem to have the extra $ to pay more towards your loan we do n't know anything else   i wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan but was also pondering a home purchase in the future student loans and your first mortgage discusses the math behind one 's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage in your case the question is whether in 5 years the $ 8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8 loan   if you specifically had plans toward home ownership the timing of that plan would affect my answer here as i discuss in the article   the right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation   meanwhile the plan comes at a cost your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years but if you simply double up the payments advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal it would drop to just a couple month over over 4 as you read more about personal finance you 'll find a lot of different views some people are fixated on having zero debt others will focus on liquidity in the end you need to understand each approach and decide what 's right for you

gt one of the best news i 've heard today that 's the right way awesome gesture   i do n't know on this one while it gives the warm all it means in reality is the seats will be all be sold out really fast    the economist in me that i pretend to be while listening to freakonomics in my car wants to point to this quote that i feel turned me around on this   and consumer surplus is one of the most important things in economics one of the incredible of the market system is that for so much of what we buy we would have been willing to pay way more for it than we actually have to a great example is water how much do we pay for water each month i do n’t know what your water bill is mine is maybe $ 40 but think about how much we ’d be willing to pay for water water is i mean we ’d be willing to pay almost anything for water but it ’s really really cheap so in that way the modern economy has arranged things so that we get things we need like water and food much more cheaply than we ’d be willing to pay and that is really important that is really the magic of the market    gt to me what sounds like the problem is how do you measure that because i need to know what you in your head were willing to pay before you came to the store and then were confronted with the actual price so how typically have economists measured those two numbers what you pay and what you ’re willing to pay   gt so you have never been more right about anything in your life than what you just said because we simply have no good ways to measure consumer surplus because we know what people pay we can sometimes see that observe how much they buy but we never see what ’s inside their head what their choice what they would be willing to pay if we ’re really going to estimate a consumer surplus what you would want to do is you would want to take a consumer and somehow magically you ’d want to reproduce that consumer in 10 parallel universes   source

you 'll need to read carefully the german laws on tax residency in many european and other tax laws the loss of residency due to absence is conditioned on acquiring residency elsewhere but in general it is possible to use treaties and statuses so that you end up not being resident anywhere but it does n't mean that the income is no longer taxed generally every country taxes income sourced to it unless an exclusion applies so if you can no longer apply the treaty due to not being a resident you 'll need to look for general exclusions in the tax law i do n't know how germany taxes scholarships under the general rules you 'll have to check it it is possible that they 're not taxed many people try to raise the argument of i 'm not a resident to avoid income taxes altogether on earnings on their work this would not work but with a special kind of income like scholarship which may be exempt under the law it may keep in mind that the treaty has who is or was immediately before visiting a contracting state a resident of the other contracting state language in some relevant cases so you may still apply it in the us even if no longer resident in germany

the two answers given previously provide excellent information in relation to your statement if i buy the above future contract does that mean i pay $ on june 13th you can not buy the futures contract at that price the price you are seeing quoted is not a dollar value but rather a value in points each contract has a point value and this varies from one contract to another according to the specifications set out by the exchange the point value is in dollars and it therefore acts as a multiplier for the price that you 've seen quoted let 's look at an example for the e mini s&p futures these trade electronically on the globex exchange the ecn order book of the cme and carry the ticker symbol es   the es contract has a point value of $ 50 if the quoted price for the es is then its dollar value is 50 x = $ so in order to buy this contract outright with absolutely no use of leverage then one theoretically requires $ in one 's account in practice though futures are traded on margin and so only a deposit amount is required at the time of purchase as cqm has explained

not at all impossible what you need is fundamental analysis and relationship with your investment if you are just buying shares not sure you can have those i will provide examples from my personal experience   my mother has barely high school education when she saw house and land prices in bulgaria she thought it 's impossibly cheap we lived on rent in israel our horrible apartment was worth $ 1 m and it was horrible we could never imagine buying it because we were middle class at best my mother insisted that we all sell whatever we have and buy land and houses in bulgaria one house for example went from $ 20k to between 2001 and 2007 but we knew bulgaria we knew how to buy we knew lawyers we knew builders   the company i currently work for when i joined share prices were around 240 2006 they are now 2015 at 1500 i did n't buy because i was repaying mortgage at 5 i am very sorry i did n't everybody knew 240 is not a real share price for our company an established + 30 years software company with piles of cash we were not a hot startup outsiders did n't invest many developers and finance people who work in the company made a fortune again relationship knowledge   i bought a house in the uk in 2012 everyone knew house prices were about to go up i was lucky i had a friend who was a he told me buy now or lose money i bought a little house for 200k it is now worth not double but pretty good money   my point is take your investment personally do n't just dump money into something once you are an insider your risk will be almost mitigated and you could buy where you see an opportunity and sell when you feel you are near the maximal real worth of your investment it 's not hard to analyse it 's hard to make a commitment

i second or fifth the answers of the other users in that this should have been foreseen and discussed prior to entering the partnership   but to offer a potential solution if the mortgage company allows you to assume the whole mortgage big if you could buy the other partner out to determine what a fair buyout would be take the current value of the house less the remaining mortgage to get the current equity half that is each partner 's current gain or potentially loss and could be considered a fair buyout at this point the partner realizes any gains made in the last 5 years and from now on the whole house and any future gains or losses will be yours alternatively your partner could remain a full partner if s he so desires until the house sells you would see the house as a separate business split the cost as you have and you would pay fair market rent each month half of which would come back to you a third option would be to refinance the house with you as a sole mortgage holder to factor in how much your partner should receive out of the transaction you can take his her current equity and subtract half of the costs associated with the refi i would also recommend both of you seek out the help of a real estate lawyer at this point to help you draft an agreement it sounds like you 're still on good terms so you could see a lawyer together this would be helpful because they should know all the things you should look out for in a situation like this good luck

you have a few options option 1 leave the money where it is if your balance is over $ 5k you should be able to leave the money in your former employer 's 401(k the money will stay there and continue to be invested in the funds that you elect to invest in you should at the very least be receiving quarterly statements for the account even better you should have access to some type of an online account where you can transfer your investments rebalance your account conform to target etc if you do not have online account access than i 'm sure you can still transfer investments and make trades via a paper form just reach out to the 401(k tpa or recordkeeper that administers your plan their contact info is on the quarterly statements you should be receiving option 2 rollover the money into your current employer 's 401(k plan this is the option that i tend to recommend the most roll the money over into your current employer 's 401(k plan this way all the money is in the same place and is invested in the funds that you elect let 's say you wanted to transfer your investments to a new fund lineup right now you have to fill out the paperwork or go through the online process twice for both accounts moving the money to your current employer 's plan and having all the money in the same place eliminates this redundancy and allows you to make one simple transfer of all your assets option 3 roll the money from your former employer 's plan into an ira this is a cool option because now you have a new ira with a new set of dollar limits you can roll the money into a separate ira and contribute an additional $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 if you are 50 + years of age so this is cool because it gives you a chance to save even more for retirement many ira companies give you a sign on bonus where if you rollover your former employers they will give you a bonus typically a few hundred bucks but hey its free money other things to note take a look at your plan document from your former employer 's 401(k plan take a look at the fees compare the fees to your current employer 's plan there could be a chance that the fees from your former employer 's plan are much higher than your current employer so this would just be yet another reason to move the money to your current employer 's plan do n't forget you most likely have a financial advisor that oversees your current employer 's 401(k plan this financial advisor also probably takes fees from your account so use his services you are probably already paying for it talk to your hr at your employer and ask who the investment advisor is call the advisor and set up an appointment to talk about your retirement and financial goals ask him for his advice its always nice talking to someone with experience face to face good luck with everything

forecasts of stock market direction are not reliable so you should n't be putting much weight on them   long term you can expect to do better in stocks but obtaining this better expected return has the danger of buying in to the market at a particularly bad moment leading to a substantially lower return   so mitigate that risk while moving in a big piece of cash by dollar cost averaging   an example would be to divide your cash hoard conceptually into say six pieces and invest each piece in the index fund two months apart   after a year you will have invested the whole sum at about the average of the index for the year

gt;they will want to step away for a few years then will quickly realize or already knew holding cash is just as bad of an investment they will then turn to hedges against inflation real assets further devaluing the dollar they will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value   this is where you differ from the fed not saying either one of you is wrong but the fed wants inflation in order to force individuals and more importantly businesses to invest their capital in capex equities or other risky assets in order to combat inflation   you bring up a good point that if they chose to invest solely in inflation hedges it may compound the problem what happens when supply and demand are forced back towards equilibrium though gold is a different animal but for other metals with industrial uses would demand through inflation hedging be able to fend off decreased industrial and actual demand for the physical material

yes but the rates at which they 're borrowing make all the difference   japan 's central bank is borrowing at about 2 percent on a 30 year bond and greece is borrowing at 18 percent japan would thus be paying 4.6 of gdp on debt service for government borrowing while greece would thus be paying 27 assuming that all current bonds could be converted to current rates    markets rates bonds government bonds stats money long html    further as many other commenters have noted japan retains the ability to print money and thus inflate their debt away while greece relies on the european central bank which would not the entire eurozone to help out greece 's government   as a comparison the us is currently paying 1.3 of its gdp on government debt service    my calculations are amateur please correct me if i 'm wrong   as dean baker blogs blog the interest burden of the debt   it is important to remember that most of the people in washington debates on economic policy do not know much economics they tend not to be very good at arithmetic either that is why they were blindsided by the collapse of the $ 8 trillion housing bubble that wrecked the economy   as we get endless about the crushing debt burden it is worth touching base with reality on occasion in that spirit brings you the latest data and projections on the ratio of the federal government 's interest payments to gdp courtesy of the congressional budget office cbo   interest to gdp ratio is currently at a crushing 1.3 percent near the post world war ii low however this figure the burden somewhat last year the federal reserve board refunded almost $ 80 billion to the treasury this was interest earned on government bonds and other assets it now holds that leaves a net interest burden of 0.8 percent of gdp by far the lowest of the post world war ii era   tl;dr what matters is not total size of debt alone but also borrowing costs and ability to inflate the debt away japan is paying very little on its large debt greece is paying a lot    tl;dr tl;dr i 'd like to borrow a few trillion dollars at 2 too

to speak to this a little more broadly apart from groups like hedge funds and other investors investing for purely speculative purposes one of the major purposes of forwards and for that matter futures for companies in the real economy is to lock in a particular price in advance or to reduce the risk of some kind of investment or transaction investopedia defines a currency forward as follows with a few key points emphasized a currency forward is a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that locks in the exchange rate for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date a currency forward is essentially a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment the other major benefit of a currency forward is that it can be tailored to a particular amount and delivery period unlike standardized currency futures this can be a major advantage for planning and risk management purposes for example if i know i 'm going to have to pay $ 1 million usd in the future and most of my revenue is in euros the actual amount i 'll have to pay will vary based on the exchange rate between euros and dollars thus it 's very worthwhile for me to be able to lock in a particular exchange rate so that i know exactly how much i 'm going to pay relative to my projected revenue the goal is n't necessarily to make money off the transaction maybe they do maybe they do n't as much as to reduce risk and improve planning ability the fact that it does n't involve an up front payment is also a major advantage it 's usually a bad practice to sit on cash for a year if you can avoid it another key point savings accounts pay less interest than inflation if inflation is 3 and your savings account pays 1 that looks remarkably like a guaranteed 2 loss to me

actually asking to be refinanced at a lower rate is asking them to forgive give up part of the mortgage    either my knowledge of finance is wrong or how interest rates work is wrong if that statement is true    here is why your statement is not true   the interest rate is money the bank makes on the loan    for example say you buy a home valued at $ 250,000 put 10 down and your interest rate is 5 for 30 years    well now you 've got a mortgage $ 225,000 that you pay $ monthly now expand this out to 30 years which means you 'll make 360 payments for a total balance of $ so even though you have a mortgage of $ 225,000 and your home is only valued at $ 250,000 due to the interest rate on that loan you will   be giving the bank $ in profit for that $ 225,000 loan    refinancing the loan at a lower rate is not debt forgiveness or a write off    greed in getting themselves into upside down mortgages are why we have problems not the banks not helping them out enough   actually it 's the bank 's greed which is wanting to keep the homeowner at the higher interest rate because it will make them more money over the long run if the bank was to reduce the interest rate on the loan they would be reducing their potential profits    and now you know why i support non profit banks

most likely this will not work they way you think first things first to get a loan the bank needs to accept your collateral note that this is not directly related to the question what you plan to do with the loan example you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth usd 2 million the bank decides to give you a loan of usd 1 million against that collateral the bank does n't care if you will use the loan to invest in foreign re or use it up in a casino it has your collateral as safety so from the way you describe it i take it you do n't have the necessary local collateral but you wish to use your foreign investments as such in this case it really does n't matter where you live or where you incorporate a company the bank will only give you the loan if it accepts the foreign collateral from professional experience with this exact question i can tell you there are very few banks that will lend against foreign property and there are even less banks if any that will lend against foreign projects to sum it up just forget banks you might find a private lender to help you out but it will cost you dearly the best option you have is to find a strategic partner who can cough up the money you need but since he is taking the bigger risk he will also take the bigger profit share

what does negative total equity means in mcdonald 's balance sheet it means that their liabilities exceed their total assets   usually is means that a company has accumulated losses over time but that 's just one explanation    but is n't mcdonald a very healthy company and never lost money just because a company has always money does not mean it 's a healthy company   it may have borrowed a lot of money in order to operate and now the growth is not able to keep up with the debt load in mcdonald 's case the major driver in the equity change is the fact that they have bought back over $ 20 billion in stock over the past few years which reduces assets and equity   if they had instead paid off debt their equity would not be negative but their debt may be so cheap in terms of interest rate that it made more financial sense to buy back stock instead of paying off debt   there are too many variables to assess that in this forum

a stock is an ownership interest in a company   there can be multiple classes of shares but to simplify assuming only one class of shares a company issues some number of shares let 's say 1,000,000 shares and you can buy shares of the company if you own 1,000 shares in this example you would own one one of the company   public companies have their shares traded on the open market and the price varies as demand for the stock comes and goes relative to people willing to sell their shares you typically buy stock in a company because you believe the company is going to prosper into the future and thus the value of its stock should rise in the open market a bond is an indebted interest in a company   a company issues bonds to borrow money at an interest rate specified in the bond issuance and makes periodic payments of principal and interest   you buy bonds in a company to lend the company money at an interest rate specified in the bond because you believe the company will be able to repay the debt per the terms of the bond   the value of a bond as traded on the open exchange varies as the prevailing interest rates vary   if you buy a bond for $ 1,000 yielding 5 interest and interest rates go up to 10 the value of your bond in the open market goes down so that the payment terms of 5 on $ 1,000 matches hypothetical terms of 10 on a lesser principal amount   whatever lesser principal amount at the new rate would lead to the same payment terms determines the new market value    alternatively if interest rates go down the current value of your bond increases on the open market to make it appear as if it is yielding a lower rate regardless of the market value the company continues to pay interest on the original debt per its terms so you can always hold onto a bond and get the original promised interest as long as the company does not go bankrupt so in summary bonds tend to be a safer investment that offers less potential return   however this is not always the case since if interest rates skyrocket your bond 's value will plummet although you could just hold onto them and get the low rate originally promised

in a quote driven market must every investor trade with a market         maker in other words two parties that are both not market makers         can not trade between themselves directly in a way yes all trades go through a market maker but those trades can be orders put in place by a person ie you or me does a quote driven market only display the best bid and ask         prices proposed by the market makers in other words only the         highest bid price among all the market makers is displayed and         other lower bid prices by other market makers are not similarly         only the lowest ask price over all market makers is displayed and         other higher ask prices by other market makers are not no you can see other lower bid and higher ask prices in a order driven market is it meaningful to talk about the current stock price which is the price of last transaction well that 's kind of an opinion information is information so it wo n't be bad to know it personally i would say the bid and ask price is more important however in the real world these prices are changing constantly and quickly so realistically it is easier to keep track of the quote price and most likely the bid ask spread is small and the quote will fall in between the less liquid a security is the more important the bid ask is this goes for all market types for a specific asset will there be several transactions happened at     the same time but with different prices today with electronic markets trades can happen so quickly it 's difficult to say in the us stock market trades happen one at a time but there is no set time limit between each trade so within 1 second you can have a trade be $ 50 or $ however it will only go to $ when the lower ask prices have been exhausted    does an order driven market have market makers   by definition no what are some examples of quote driven and order driven financial markets in which investors are commonly trading stocks and derivatives especially in u.s. quote driven market bond market forex order driven market nyse comes from an order driven market but now would be better classified as a market conclusion if you are asking in order to better understand today 's stock markets then these old definitions of quote market or order market may not work the big markets in the real world are neither ie nasdaq nyse the nyse and nasdaq are better classified as a market as they use more then a single tactic from both market types to insure market liquidity and transparency markets these days are strongly electronic fast and fairly liquid in most cases here are some resources to better understand these markets an introduction to securities markets the nyse and nasdaq how they work understanding order execution

the solution is spending restraint during the growth periods and prudent application of counter cyclical fiscal policy especially during the slow periods the usa on a strange experiment lead be greenspan of excessively low interest rates for a prolonged period of time periods of strong economic growth should feature high interest rates periods of reduced economic growth can then be countered somewhat through monetary policy the government should also endeavour to run surplus budgets during the good times and not be afraid of turning those into deficit budgets in the downturns if you run a deficit budget during a period of strong economic growth together with low cash rates you have nowhere to move when the cycle reverses   the solution now that is difficult i would say that the solution now would be to raise revenues through corporate taxes and similarly increase government spending on investments aimed at stimulating the economy use this time to invest in the much needed infrastructure maintenance and upgrades that the usa needs these need to be fast tracked into action and i would therefore consider fixing infrastructure as more important than installing new infrastructure    there are probably long term structural adjustments that need to be looked at too but i am not intimately familiar with the usa as i am australian it is clear however that austerity during economic downturns does not help end the recession or benign growth it is clear to me as an observer however that employment appears to be the big issue in the usa right now so cutting jobs is not a smart move   edit i 'll point out that my opinion comes from the australian experience our government ran surplus budgets during our period of recent growth and our reserve bank kept interest rates high when the gfc hit us in 2008 the government almost instantly reversed its fiscal policy going so far as mailing $ 900 cheques to every australian just to get cash flowing in the economy they then upon infrastructure spending programs similarly the reserve bank were able to quickly and dramatically reduce interest rates the result was that we saw 1 quarter of mildly negative growth and positive growth ever since hence no recession we ran a textbook example of counter cyclical fiscal and monetary policy which is today lauded by economists over we now have 5 unemployment low government debt relative to the oecd and high economic growth relative to the oecd

you 're certainly referring to ex post facto laws and while the us is prohibited from passing criminal laws that are retroactive the us supreme court has upheld many tax laws that apply tax code changes retroactively you might ask a similar question on law se for a more thorough treatment of the legalities of congress passing those laws but i will stick to the personal finance portion of the question what this means is that you ca n't expect that the current tax laws will be in force in the future and your investment retirement plans should be as flexible as possible you may wish to have some money in both roth and traditional 401(k accounts you might not want to have millions of dollars in roth accounts because if congress does act to limit the tax benefits of those accounts it will probably be targeting the larger balances if you are valuing tax deductions you should put slightly more weight on deductions that you can take today than deductions that would apply in the future if you do find yourself in trouble because of a retroactive change be sure to consult a tax lawyer that specializes in dealing with the irs to possibly negotiate a settlement for a lower amount than the full tax bill that results from the changes

it appears very possible that google will not have to pay any class c holders the settlement amount given the structure of the settlement   this is precisely because of the arbitrage opportunity you 've highlighted   this idea was mentioned last summer in as explained in a dealbook article the settlement requires google to pay the following amounts if one year from the issuance of the class c shares the value according to the following formula if the c share price is equal to or more than 1 percent but less than 2 percent below the a share price 20 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 2 percent but less than 3 percent below the a share price 40 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 3 percent but less than 4 percent below the a share price 60 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 4 percent but less than 5 percent below the a share price 80 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 5 percent below the a share price 100 percent of the difference up to 5 percent if the class a shares trade around $ 450 after the split c issuance and the c shares trade at a 4.5 percent discount during the year or $ per share then investors expect a payment of 80 percent times $ 450 times 4.5 percent = $ the value of c shares would then be $ $ plus $ but if this is the new trading value during the year that ’s only a discount of less than 1 percent to the a shares so no payment would be made but if no payment is made we are back to the full discount and this continues ad infinitum in other words the value of a stock can be displayed as equity value + dividend value + voting value + settlement value = total share value if we ignore dividend and voting values and ignore premiums and discounts for risk and so forth then the value of a share is basic equity value plus anticipated settlement payoff   the google class c settlement is structured to reduce the payoff as the value   and the practice of arbitrage guarantees if you buy into at least semi strong emh that the price of c shares will be up by arbitrageurs that want the payoff the voting value of googl is effectively zero since the non traded class b shares control all company decisions   so the value of the class a googl voting is virtually zero for the time being   the only divergence between googl and goog price is dividends which i believe is supposed to be the same and the settlement payoff   somebody who places zero value on the vote and who expects dividend difference to be zero should always prefer to buy goog to googl until the price is equal disregarding the settlement so technically someone is better off owning goog if dividends are the same and market prices are equal just because the vote is worthless and the nonzero chance of a future settlement payoff is gravy the arbitrage itself is present because a share that costs as in the article $ is worth $ if the settlement pays out at that rate   the stable equilibrium is probably either just before or just after the threshold where the settlement pays off depending on how reliably arbitrageurs can predict the movement of goog and googl if i can buy a given stock for x but know that it 's worth x+1 then i 'm willing to pay up to x+1   in the google case the goog stock is worth where s is an uncertain settlement payment that could be zero or could be substantial   we have six tiers of s counting zero payoff so that the price is likely to follow a pattern from x to to x to x and climbing the tier ladder until it lands in the frontier between and   every time it jumps into people should be willing to pay that new amount for goog so the price moves out of payoff range and into where people will only pay x. i 'm actually simplifying here since technically this is all based on future expectations   so the actual price you 'd pay is expressed thus resale value of goog before settlement payoff = x + expectation that settlement payoff will pay 100 of difference = s5 expected nominal difference between goog and googl = d + s4 80 d + s3 60 d + s2 40 d + s1 20 d + 0 d   = price willing to pay for class c goog = p plus you 'd technically have to present value the whole thing for the time horizon since the payoff is in a year   note that i 've any voting dividend analysis into x.   it 's reasonable to thing that s5 s4 s3 and maybe s2 are nearly zero given the open arbitrage opportunity   and we know that times 0 of d is zero   so the real analysis again ignoring pv is thus p = x + which is a long way of saying what are the odds that goog will happen to be worth no more than 99 of googl on the payoff determination date

when you get a loan car home student the lending company bank give the auto dealer previous home owner school money you as the borrow promise to pay this money back with interest   so in your case the 100,000 you borrow requires a payment for principal and interest of per month after 240 payments you will have paid the bank   so who got the in interest the bank did it was used to pay interest to the people who made deposits into the bank it was also used to pay the expenses of the bank salaries retirement rent electricity computers etc if the bank is a company with investors they may have to pay dividends to them to   of course not all loans are successfully paid back so some of the payment goes to cover the loans that are in default in many cases loans are also refinanced or the house is sold long before the 20 30 year term is up in these cases the amount of interest received for that loan is much less than anticipated but the good news is that it can be loaned out again

what official actions has trump taken to push the market     it seems to me the market is responding to a belief that regulations wo n't be enforced or back and that maybe tax reform e.g. tax cuts for the wealthy may be enacted     meanwhile with the muslim travel ban states are losing billions of dollars of locally generated income because foreigners of all types are slowing travel

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too
