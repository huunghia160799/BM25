an llc or an s corp will result in the same tax obligations because both are pass through tax entities an llc is more flexible for the situation you describe because the member and manager responsibilities can be detailed in the operating agreement you really should get a business attorney to help you get your operating agreement in order there 's also a startups beta site on stack exchange that may be able to help you with questions about ways to handle your operating agreement

this is actually quite a complicated issue i suggest you talk to a properly licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state legal advice from an attorney licensed in your state is also highly recommended there are many issues at hand here income both types of entities are pass through so earnings are taxed the same however for s corp there 's a reasonable compensation requirement so while b and c do n't do any work they may be required to draw salary as executives directors if they act as such equity for s corp you can not have different classes of shares all are the same so you can not have 2 partners contribute money and third to contribute nothing work is compensated you 'll be getting salary and all three have the same stake in the company you can have that with an llc expansion s corp is limited to x shareholders all of which have to be americans once you get a foreign partner or more than 100 partners you automatically become c corp whether you want it or not investors it would be very hard for you to find external investors if you 're a llc there are many more things to consider do not make this decision lightly fixing things is usually much more expensive than doing them right at the first place

possibly not relevant to the original asker but in the uk another advantage of using a credit card is that when making a purchase over £ 100 and paying by credit card you get additional protection on the purchase which you would n't get when paying by debit card e.g. if you buy something costing £ 100 and the company goes bust before it 's delivered you can claim the money back from the credit card company   whereas if you paid by debit card you would potentially lose out this protection is a legal requirement under section 75 of the consumer credit act 1974

arguably because they can   canada 's banking industry is dominated by five chartered banks who by virtue of their size pretty much determine how banking is done in canada yes they have to abide by government regulation but they carry enough weight to influence government and to some extent shape the regulation they have to follow while this situation makes canada 's financial system very stable and efficient it also permits anti competitive behavior   there was a time when u.s. banks were not permitted to operate across state lines when the smallest of canada 's big 5 was bigger than the biggest u.s. bank despite our economy having always been about 1/10 the size of the u.s. that scale and their small number gives the big 5 the ability to invest heavily in and collaborate on whatever they decide to be in their own interest so if they want to charge fees they do

do n't use a credit repair agency they are scams one of the myriad of ways in which they work is by setting you up with a bogus loan which they will report you as paying on time they 'll pretend to be a used car dealer or some other credit based merchant for a time this will actually work this is called false reporting the problem is the data clearinghouses are not stupid and eventually realize some hole in the wall car dealer with no cars on the lot yes they do physical inspections as part of the process just sometimes they 're a little slow about it is reporting trade lines worth millions of dollars per year it 's a major problem in the industry but eventually that business loses its fraudulent reporting ability those trade lines get revoked and your account gets flagged for a fraud investigation the repair agency has your money and you still do n't have good credit bad news if this all goes down while you 're trying to close on a house you 're better off trying to settle your debts usually for 50 or declaring bankruptcy altogether the latter is n't so bad if you 're in a stable home because you wo n't be able to get an apartment for a while credit cards or a good deal on auto financing   ed i just saw what one agency was charging and can tell you declaring bankruptcy costs only a few hundred dollars more than the repair agency and is 100 guaranteed to get you predictable results as long as you name all your debts up front and are n't getting by student loans and considering you ca n't stomach well guess what now you 'll have a lawyer to deal with them for you anything you accomplish through an agency will eventually be reversed because it 's fraudulent but through bankruptcy your credit will start improving within two years the tradeoff being that you wo n't be able to get a mortgage at all or apartment easily during that so find a place to down for a few years before you declare

if you enter a futures contract it costs nothing   so every time prices move against you there is a margin call and you must put up some new money inverse etf 's use a variety of similar strategies to get their returns   many of these strategies may indeed require a margin call to the etf issuer if prices move against you   but remember the etf did not cost nothing   investors contributed money in order to purchase each share of the etf   therefore the etf issuer has a big pot of money available for use as margin   that 's why the margin call never comes through to you in a sense you posted a ton of margin up front so you wo n't have to make any additional margin contributions   the money that will be used for margin calls is being kept in treasuries and money market securities by the etf issuer until it 's needed if prices move against you badly enough that it looks like the etf is at risk to not be able to post margin the etf would liquidate and you 'd get whatever pittance was left after they exit all those positions

can i pay $ 12,000 extra once a year or $ 1000 every month which option is better depends when if you mean 12 k now vs 1 k a month over the next 12 months repeating this each year now wins if you mean saving 1 k a month for 12 months then doing a the 1 k a month wins basically a sooner payment saves you more money than a later payment the first option does sound better but for a 30 year mortgage is it that significant your number one issue is that you have a thirty year mortgage the interest you pay on it is monstrous for the 30 year term you pay around 500 k in interest a 15-year mortgage is 300 k cheaper only 200 k in interest will be paid the monthly payment would be 1250 more how much money and years on a mortgage can i save when is the best time to pay at the end of each year you can knock off about a dozen years save i think you can find mortgage calculators online or talk to your mortgage advisor to play around with the numbers

i agree with the other posters that you will need to seek the advice of a tax attorney specializing in corporate taxation here is an idea to investigate could you sell the company and thereby turn the profits that are taxed as ordinary income into a long term capital gain taxed at 15 plus state income tax if any you can determine the value of a profitable business using discounted cash flow analysis even if you expect that the revenue stream will dry up due to product obsolescence or expiry of licensing agreements   to avoid the capital gains taxes especially if you live in a high tax state like california you could also transfer the stock to a charitable remainder trust the crt then sells the shares to the third party acquirer invests the proceeds and pays you annual distributions similar to an annuity the flip side of a sale is that now the acquiring party will be stuck with the taxes payable on your company 's profits while being forced to amortize the purchase price over multiple years 15 if i recall correctly which will factor into the valuation however it is likely that the acquirer has better ways to mitigate the tax impact e.g. the acquirer is a company currently operating at a loss and therefore can cancel out the tax liabilities from your company 's profits   one final caveat do n't let the tax tail wag the business dog in other words focus your on extracting the maximum value from your company rather than trying to find convoluted tax saving strategies you might find that making an extra dollar in profits is easier than saving fifty cents in taxes

yes i know this is a seven year old question does this only apply to debts that were taken on during marriage   yes or to all debts of both partners no the important thing to remember is that it 's both debts and assets acquired during the marriage which are shared this comes from the reality that men in the olden times were the ones in business accumulating wealth etc while the woman made the home   the working assumption was that the woman who made the home was an equal partner with the man since he benefited from a good home and she benefited from his income the fact that pre marriage debts and assets were not community property also protected the woman because she was able to then take back her and use that to support herself i live in a cp state

it depends on the exact level of risk that you want but if you want to keep your risk close to zero you 're pretty much stuck with the banks and those rates do n't look to be going up any time soon if you 're willing to accept a little more risk you can invest in some index tracking etfs instead with the main providers in australia being vanguard street state and   a useful tool for for an overview of the australian etf market is offered by the index funds reduce your level of risk by investing in an index of the market e.g. the s&p 200 tracked by   if the market as a whole rises then your investment will too even though within that index individual companies will rise and fall this limits your potential rate of return as well and is still significantly more risky than leaving your cash in an aussie bank after all the whole market can fall but it might strike the right balance for you if you 're getting started hsbc and westpac were all offering a couple of months of free trades up to a certain value   once the free trades are done you 'll do better to move to another broker you can migrate your shares to the others to take advantage of their free trades too or to a cheaper broker like cmc markets

what i do not get is why does the author choose to buy an itm put if    the goal was to not lose more than 5.6 he could have chosen a out of    money put where the strike is ~6 otm the reason why he is buying a itm put instead of a put 5 6 below the atm price is because he wants to only lose 5 6 after all fee 's   a put at 5 6 below atm is not free so it will not actually provide a 6 cushion more likely maximum loss after it 's cost is accounted for you can not rely on the strike alone to determine the level of protection you are buying   real world example   spy dec 2017 strike put costs $ it 's about 6 otm but it costs roughly 10 of spy $ at best it would protect 85 of your net worth    strike costs = protection   did he choose an itm put because he does not want to pay any time    premium does he not lose in wide bid ask spreads what he gains by not    paying time premium nope you were just misunderstanding how he calculated his protection he wanted to protect 5 6 after the cost of the hedge he needed to select an itm put because time premiums are so high that an otm put would n't suffice

to answer your question briefly net income is affected by many things inside and outside of management control and must be supplemented by other elements to gain a clear picture of a company 's health to answer your question in depth we must look at the history of financial reporting initially accounting was primarily cash based that is a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash and records expenses when cash goes out the door this was not a perfectly accurate system as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable collection times may differ etc to combat problems with cash based accounting financial reporting moved to an accrual based system an accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction for example when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money you record the revenue then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item rather than an income statement item another example if your landlord charges you rent on december 31st for the past year then in each month leading up to december you accrue the expense on the income statement even though you have n't paid the landlord yet accrual based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation enron is a prime example among other things they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred this accelerated their income by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible there are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms theoretically they exist to catch material in the financial statements finally some items impacting profit do not show up in net income they show up in other comprehensive income oci oci is meant to show items that occurred in the year but were outside of management control for example changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or changes in the value of company pension plan which are impacted by the stock market however while oci is meant to pick up all non management caused items it is a grey area and may not be 100 representative of this idea so in theory net income is meant to represent items within management control however given the grey area in accounting interpretation net income may be accelerated and it also may include some items that occurred by some random business fluke outside of company control finally consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year end so a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in march but perhaps jan march results are terrible in conclusion net income is an attempt at giving what you want an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control however it may be inaccurate due to various factors from malfeasance to incompetence   that 's why other financial measures exist as another way to answer the same question about a company 's health to see if those answers agree ex say net income is $ 10 m this year but was only $ 6 m last year great it went up by $ 4 m but now assume that accounts receivable shows $ 7 m owed to the company at dec 31 when last year there was only $ 1 m owed to the company that might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt   unfortunately there is no single number that you can use to see the whole company different metrics must be used in conjunction to get a clear picture

i have heard that it is better for your credit score to pay them down over time will it make much of a difference i have never heard that however the financial institutions who are charging you an amount of interest which was at one time in the not so distant past classified and punishable in state criminal codes really enjoy you thinking that way you are clearly capable of doing the math yourself while i do n't know the exact numbers i am totally confident that you will find in about 5 or 10 minutes if that long that eliminating debt of any kind in your life will pay an immediate return that beats the great majority of other investments in terms of risk reward after the immediate financial return there is a and even greater long term benefit basic principle highest rates first perhaps this decision could be considered slightly less important than deciding not to smoke during your youth but i would put it as a close second you are already in a position where you can see the damage that your prior decisions about financial debt have produced run the clock back to the time in your life when you were debt free now pay off that debt with the big check and start from zero now turn on your psychic powers and predict the same amount of time in the future with the same amount of money do n't even try to adjust for inflation just use flat dollars without losing the money which you have given to the financial institutions during this previous part of your life do you now see why the financial institutions want you to think about slowly paying them off instead of waking up tomorrow without owing them anything

if i do n't need this money for decades meaning i can ride out periodical market crashes why would i invest in bonds instead of funds that track broad stock market indexes you would n't   but you can never be 100 sure that you really wo n't need the money for decades   also even if you do n't need it for decades you can never be 100 certain that the market will not be way down at the time decades in the future when you do need the money   the amount of your portfolio you allocate to bonds relative to stocks can be seen as a measure of your desire to guard against that uncertainty i do n't think it 's accurate to say that the general consensus is that your portfolio should at least be 25 in bonds   for a young investor with high risk tolerance many would recommend less than that   for instance this page from t. rowe price suggests no more than 10 bonds for those in their 20s or 30s basically you would put money into bonds rather than stocks to reduce the volatility of your portfolio   if you care only about maximizing return and do n't care about volatility then you do n't have to invest in bonds   but you probably actually do care about volatility even if you do n't think you do   you might not care enough to put 25 in bonds but you might care enough to put 10 in bonds

there are several ways to protect against or even profit from a market correction hedge funds do this by hedging that is buying a stock that they think is strong and selling short a paired stock that is weak if you hold say a strong retail company in your portfolio you might sell short an equal weight of a weak retail company   these are like buying insurance on your portfolio if you own 300 shares of xyz currently trading at $ 68 you buy puts at a level at a strike price that lets you sleep at night for example you might buy 3 xyz 6-month puts with a strike price of $ 60 a disadvantage is that the puts are wasting assets that is their time premium which you paid for at the outset becomes zero at expiration this is why it is like insurance you would n't complain that your insurance premium was lost when you purchase insurance on your house and the house does n't burn down would you of course not the purpose of the insurance is to protect your investment note that as these puts are married they only protect your portfolio instead of profiting from a correction you would merely protect your portfolio during a correction no small feat if your portfolio is similar to the market you can buy s&p index puts if your market reflects a lot of technology you can buy technology sector puts   say you have a portfolio of $ 80 k that reflects the market you could buy out of the market puts again reflecting your tolerance for loss any losses in your portfolio after the puts go in the money would be more or less offset by gains in the puts   an advantage is that the bid ask spread is smaller for the s&p. you would pay less for the protection also the s&p puts are cash settled meaning you get money put in your account on the business day after expiration day a disadvantage is that the puts do not linearly go up as the market drops delta hedging is a big deal in and of itself another disadvantage is that they are wasting assets see the married puts section previous while the s&p puts can be used to maintain your market portfolio in the midst of a correction you could purchase more puts than needed if you had correctly timed the market then your portfolio with puts would increase your mileage may vary some have predicted an imminent market crash way too often collars involve selling out of the money calls and using the premiums to buy out of the money puts there are many varieties of collars but the most straightforward is to sell 1 call and buy 1 put for every 100 shares this can also be done for index puts and calls this has the effect of simultaneously you get your insurance for almost free but again it is protecting your portfolio   as the name implies you make money when the market goes bearish   bear put spreads involve buying puts at a close strike price and selling an equal number of puts at a lower strike price than the first you have a defined maximum loss the premium you paid for the higher put minus the premium you received for the lower put you have a defined maximum gain the difference between strikes minus the defined maximum loss   buy s&p 500 index puts if you buy deep out of the money puts it wo n't cost much but you have little probability of it paying off but if they go in the money there could be a sizable payoff this is similar to putting one chip on red 18 on the roulette wheel but rather than paying off it is a variable payoff if you 're $ 1 in the money you just get $ 100 if you 're $ 12 in the money you have a $ 1200 payoff   if you buy at the money puts it will cost a lot and your probability will be about 1 in 2 that you will pay off in our roulette analogy this is like putting 30 chips on the even bet of the roulette wheel the variable payoff is as in the previous paragraph but you 're more likely to get a payoff and you will lose it all of the roulette ball lands on an odd number 0 or 00 that is the underlying of your put goes up or stays the same if your research shows you what good stocks to buy it may also tell you which stocks are ripe for a fall you could short sell these stocks or buy puts on them   similar to short selling stocks or buying puts you could sell short overpriced sectors or buy puts on them there are etfs that will allow you benefit from falling prices without needing to have a margin agreement or options agreement in place   sorry to have a lengthy answer many other answers emphasize that one should n't try to time the market but that is not the op 's question provided here are both

well first off yes every year the younger generation grows up but remember that the older generation also dying off leaving the market place also what happens if the younger generation ca n't take up enough debt in order to pay for previous commitments   secondly i think you 're confusing the money supply with actual production the two are pretty much divorced from each other money does n't require a resource per se at least not since leaving the gold standard it just requires that someone is able willing to take on debt for example every time you take a loan out from the bank you are effectively creating money this is called bank credit and if you live in a country that uses fractional reserve banking then it makes up a very large part of your money supply think like up to 95 when bank 's create money they only create the principle amount ie the original loan amount and not the interest amount as well this means that someone else needs to take out a loan so that you can repay the amount in interest that you owe on your new loan this does n't normally affect you because there are lots of people taking out lots of loans all the time and money is circulating around in the economy the problem is that eventually the system gets to a stage where people ca n't really take out loans any more they just have too much debt and so you end up with a liquidity crisis like in 2008    so what i was saying is that either i 'm missing something pretty obvious and i 've got this wrong or this is exactly how it works and economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers

already a lot of great answers but since i ask myself this same question i thought i 'd share my 2 cents   as pointed out behavior is of the essence here if you 're like most recent grads this is probably the first time in your life you are getting serious about building wealth can you pay your loans down quickly and then have the discipline to invest just as much if not more than you were putting towards your loans most people are good at paying bills in full and on time yet many struggle to pay themselves in full and on time   as pointed out you can do both i find this makes a great deal of practical sense it helps form good behaviors boosts confidence and diversifies those dollars i have been paying double payments on my student loans while at the same time maxing out my ira hsa 401k i also have a rental property but that 's another can of worms i 'm getting on top and feeling confident in my finances habits etc and my loans are going down with each increase in pay i intend to pay the loans down faster than i invest until they 're paid off   again i like the idea of doing both

first i would like to use a better chart   in my opinion a close of day line chart a lot of important information   here is a daily log chart   the initial drop from the close on oct 3 was to intraday to close at on oct 10   after this the market was still very volatile and reached a low of on nov 20 closing only slightly higher than this   it traded as high as on jan 6 2009 but the whole period of nov 24 feb 13 was somewhat of a trading range of roughly 800 900   despite this the news reports of the time were frequently saying things like this is n't going to be a v shaped recovery it is going to be u shaped   the roughly one week dip you see feb 27 mar 9 taking it to an intraday low of only about 11 below the previous low on first glance appears to be just a continuation of the previous trend    however the mar 10 uptrend started with various news articles such as this one which i recall at the time suggested things like the parts of the glass steagall act of 1933 which had been repealed by the gramm leach bliley act   although these attempts appear to have been unsuccessful the widespread of such attempts in the media seemed to have reversed a common notion which i saw widespread on forums and other places that we are going to be in this mess forever the market has nowhere to go but down and therefore shorting the market is a good idea now   i do n't find the article itself but one prominent theme was the up tick rule on short selling source from this viewpoint then that the last dip was driven not so much by a recognition that the economy was really in the toilet as this really was discounted in the first drop and at least by late november had already been figured into the price   instead it was sort of the opposite of a market top where now you started seeing individual investors jump on the band wagon and decide that now was the time for a into selling short   the fact that the up tick rule was likely to be re had a noticeable effect on the final slide

this is a very important question and you will find arguments from both sides in part because it is still ben economics ph.d. from stanford answers is high frequency trading good for the economy on quite well   this is an important but question there are few    published academic studies on it though several groups are working on    the subject you may be interested in the following papers these document some of the phenomena that arise in high frequency    trading from a theoretical and an empirical perspective however a    full equilibrium analysis of the unique features of high frequency    trading is still missing and until it is done all our answers will    be kind of   tentative nevertheless there are some obvious things one can say currently    high frequency traders are competing to locate physically closer and    closer to exchanges because milliseconds matter thus large amounts    of money are being spent to beat other market makers by tiny fractions    of a second once many firms make these investments the market looks    like it did before in terms of competition and prices but is a tiny    bit faster this investment is unlikely to be socially efficient that    is the users of   the market do n't actually benefit from the fact that    their trades are executed half a millisecond faster certainly not    enough to cover all the investment that went into making that happen some people who study the issue believe that high frequency trading    hft actually exacerbates market volatility some plots to this    effect are found in the second paper linked above there is certainly    no widely accepted theory that says faster trading technology    necessarily increases efficiency and it is easy to think of    algorithms that can make money at least in the short run but hurt    most other investors as well as the informational value of the    market one caution is that some of the complaining about hft comes from those    who lose when hft gets better old style market makers they    certainly have an incentive to make hft out to be very bad so some    complaints about the predatory nature of hft should be taken with a    grain of salt there is no strong economic consensus about the value    of this activity for what it 's worth my personal impression is that    this is more bad than good i 'll post an update here as more    definitive research comes out you can also find a debate on high frequency trading from the economist which gives both sides of the argument in conclusion regardless of how you feel about hft it seems like it 's here to stay and wo n't be leaving in the foreseeable future so the debate will rage on additional resource you may finding interesting europe begins push to ban hft high frequency trading discussion on cnbc should high frequency trading hft be banned

yes you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses   how much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs   be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and if applicable your family   when buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices your decision hinges on whether or not you 'd qualify for a premium subsidy   if your agi is below 400 of the poverty line you 'll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange   if the subsidy is not meaningful to you or you would n't qualify you can buy an off exchange plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though it 's somewhat rare   in order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically if your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via cobra or you live in a state that extends the cobra requirement to smaller businesses you can choose that as well   bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans   it 's becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage   cobra is not a special type of insurance it 's a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2 10 for administrative fee popular there is no such thing as obamacare or aca coverage   obamacare the insurance market   the aca outlines certain minimum coverage requirements generally referred to as minimum essential coverage   while employers and plans are not required to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with non compliance   the single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements   the penalty is harsh enough that it 's not worth the cost of offering a non compliant plan whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange through an insurance agent or via your employer 's cobra program you will have aca coverage unless on the off chance your employer 's plan does n't check the minimum essential coverage box   so generally all plans available to you will have $ 0 preventive coverage pregnancy benefits cancer treatment benefits etc another thing to consider is your entire family does n't need to be on the same plan   if your family is healthy with the exception of one child you can purchase $ 0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family in fact you could choose cobra for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family   the things to consider when you face a lay off i tried to mitigate my use of all and always because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements such as the hobby lobby decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain benefits   understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

i will just try to come up with a totally made up example that should explain the dynamics of the hedge consider this completely made up relationship between usd eur and gold now lets say you are a european wanting to by 20 grams of gold with eur equally lets say some american by 20 grams of gold with usd their investment will have the following values see how the europeans return is while the american only has a return now lets consider that the european are aware that his currency may be against him with this investment so he decides to hedge his currency he now enters a currency swap contract with another person who has the opposite view locking in his eur usd at t2 to be the same as at he now goes ahead and buys gold in usd knowing that he needs to convert it to eur in the end but he has fixed his so that does n't worry him now let 's take a look at the investment see how the european now suddenly has the same return as the american of instead of it is hard in real life to create a perfect hedge therefore you will most often see that the are not totally the same as per answer but they do come rather close

when i play railroad tycoon iii i often send my company deep into debt to get cash on hand to buy back shares effectively increasing my ownership of the company as an absolute percentage then i issue massive dividends until my company goes bankrupt and start a new company it 's a way to shuttle money borrowed against a company 's assets into my personal bank account at no risk to me in the msft case maybe they think there will be inflation and this is a hedge against holding so many dollars in cash already if they can borrow a couple billion in 2010 dollars and pay it back in 2015 dollars they 're probably going to end up ahead if all they do is buy back shares paying dividends with the money seems stupid vs. buying back shares they 're just driving up income taxes for investors

depending on the the requirements of the annuity you might be able to pull back to part time for   a semester thus reducing the bill for that semester during that semester either get a job that will allow you to save money or get an internship related to your major some of these programs alternate between work semesters and schools semesters   many colleges have an installment plan where the payments are due every month they usually spread them out over a 10 month period most only charge a nominal fee to set up the plan this would reduce the amount of money needed to bridge the gap to only a portion of the tuition payments for the spring semester you could also live off campus to save money there is no guarantee it will be cheaper but because the costs are n't fixed and due at the start of the semester you might be able to stretch your budget

to calculate a sector or index p e ratio you need to sum the market caps of the constituent stocks and divide it by the sum of the total earnings of the constituent stocks including stocks that have negative earnings   there are no per share figures used in the calculation beware when you include an individual stock that there may be multiple issues associated with the company that are not in the index eg berkshire hathaway is in the s&p 500 but brk.a is not   in contrast google has both googl and goog included in the s&p 500 index but not its class b shares   all such shares need to be included in the market cap and figuring out the different share class ratios can be tricky

the advice to pay off debt is tough to argue against that said i 'd project out a few years to understand the home purchase will you plan for the 20 down john recommends the crazy truth about pmi ca n't be ignored the way the math works if you put 15 down the pmi costs you so much it 's nearly like paying 20 interest on that missing 5   if your answer is that you intend to save for the full downpayment 20 and can still knock off the student loan by all means go for it i have to question the validity of we will definitely be in a higher tax bracket when we retire by definition pretax deposits save tax at the marginal rate i.e. if you are in the 25 bracket a $ 1000 deposit saves you $ 250 in tax that year but withdrawals come at your average rate i.e. your tax bill divided by gross income there 's the deductions for itemized deductions or the standard then 2 exemptions if you are married then the 10 bracket etc   today a couple grossing $ 100 k may be in the 25 bracket but their average rate is 12   i read this q&a again and would add one more observation student loans and your first mortgage is an article i wrote in response to a friend 's similar question with the op having plan to buy a house paying off the loan may be more costly in the long run it may keep him from qualifying for the size mortgage he needs or from having enough money to put 20 down as i noted earlier   with finance there are very few issues that are simply black and white it 's important to understand all aspects of one 's finances to make any decision even if thee faster payoff is the right thing it 's not a slam dunk the other points should be considered

see also the question how many stocks i can exercise per stock warrant and my comments there clearly at the prices you quote it does not seem sensible to exercise your warrants at the moment since you can still by units 1 stock + 1/3 warrant and bare stock at below the $ 11.50 it would cost you to exercise your warrant   so when would exercising a warrant become a sensible thing to do obviously if the price of the bare stock which you say is currently $ were to sufficiently exceed $ 11.50 then it would clearly be worth exercising a warrant and immediately selling the stock you receive sufficiently exceed to account for any dealing costs in selling the newly acquired stock however looking more closely $ 11.50 is n't the correct cut off price consider three of the units you bought at $ each for $ you received three shares of stock and one warrant for an additional $ 11.50 $ in total you can have a total of four shares of stock at the equivalent of $ each so if the price of the bare stock rises above $ then it could become sensible to exercise one warrant and sell four shares of stock again allowing a margin for the cost of selling the stock the trading price of the original unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant should n't i believe directly affect your decision to exercise warrants although it would be a factor in deciding whether to resell the units you 've already got as you say if they are now trading at $ then having bought them at $ you would make a profit if sold unless i 'm missing something or the figures you quote are incorrect the current price of the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant $ seems overpriced compared to the price of the bare stock $ reversing the above calculation if bare stock is trading at $ then four shares would cost $ deducting the $ 11.50 cost of exercising this would value three combined units at $ or $ each which is considerably below the market price you quote one reason the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant is trading at $ instead of $ could be that the market believes the price of the bare share currently $ will eventually move towards or above $ 11.50 if that happens the option of exercising warrants at $ 11.50 becomes more and more attractive the premium presumably reflects this potential future benefit finally surely i am misunderstand the stock ipo 's intent presumably the main intent of social capital was to raise as much money as possible through this ipo to fund their future activities the positive view is that they expect this future activity to be profitable and therefore the price of ordinary stock to go up at least as far as ideally way beyond the $ 11.50 exercise price and the offering of warrants will be seen as a thank you to those investors who took the risk of taking part in the ipo a completely cynical view would be that they do n't really care what happens to the stock price but that offering free stuff or what looks like free stuff will simply attract more punters to the ipo in reality the truth is probably somewhere between those two extremes

this is a good question and my answer below being the first rationale that crossed my mind is far from fleshed out it 's just a reply based on many books on the historical cycles of markets and it 's something i 've discussed at work i work in finance    historically we can observe that periods of financial booms high valuations of public equities tend to lead to lower returns it 's a fairly simplistic notion but if you 're paying more now for something when it 's potentially close to a high water mark then you 're returns in the short term are likely to be somewhat returns from the underlying companies have a hard time keeping up with high valuations such that investors are n't likely to see a return in the short run

there are a few options that i know of but pretty much every one of them will cost more than you want to pay in fees probably   you should be able to write a check cheque to yourself   you might check with your us bank branch to see how much of a limit they 'd have   you can also use a canadian atm card at a us atm   the final option would be to use a canadian credit card for all of your purchases in the us and then pay the bill from the canadian bank account   i do n't recommend the last option because if you 're not careful to pay off the bill every month you 're running up debt   also it 's hard to pay some kinds of expenses by credit card so you 'd want a way to have cash available another option would be to use a service like paypal or to send yourself the money   again you 'd be paying fees but these might be cheaper than what the bank would charge there may be other options but these are the ones i 'm aware of   whatever you choose look carefully at what the fees would be and how long you 'd have to wait to get the money   if you can plan ahead a bit and take larger chunks of money at a time that should help keep the fees down a bit   i believe there 's also a point where you start having to report these transfers to the us government   the number $ 10,000 stick in my head but they may have changed that recently

the way i read the title i thought the game was trading stocks in other redditors for example you could invest a certain amount in other redditors and depending on the net karma for the duration of the game you would make gains or losses you could put all your money into someone with a two month old account and hope they hit the front page or invest in   someone like and have a safe bet that you 'd have at least marginal increases studying trends on the redditors past posts would influence you to buy or sell then i realized this would pretty much be impossible to pull off and that i have absolutely no idea what i 'm talking about

you are planning on buying a car that is 50 of your salary add your student debt to that and your total debt is > 50 of your salary i would suggest getting a few credit cards to build up credit but can you manage that buying a 25k car with 55k salary is overspending get a second hand car for 7k or so plus buying a new car is not smart either from a pricing standpoint if you really want a new car buy one that is 1 to 2 years old

the avalanche method does not work because most people do n't have enough money to make an avalanche   if you somehow had a windfall that was greater or equal to your highest credit card balance then by all means pay that one off    however most people do not have that kind of situation   instead they should use the debt snow ball method   they only have regular income that is typically much smaller then the balances another part of your plan that is especially troubling is that you are continuing to utilize credit cards   you need to cut them up and stop using them   first of course save $ 1000 for a small emergency fund the pay them off smallest to largest   do a budget each and every month   work an extra job or three   any extra money that hubby brings in goes towards one of the credit cards btw you do n't have a math problem you have a behavior problem

i also feel it 's important to not get a credit card i 'm in my mid 30 's and have had credit cards since i was 20 as has everyone i know every single one of those people with the exception of my dad is currently carrying some amount of credit card debt almost always in the thousands of dollars   here is the essential problem with credit cards everyone sets out with good intentions to use the credit card like a debit card and pay charges off before interest accrues however almost no one has the discipline to remember to do this and a balance quickly builds up on the card also it 's extremely easy to prioritize other bill payments before credit card payments resulting in a balance building up on the card   it 's almost magical how quickly a balance will build up on a credit card ultimately they are simply too convenient too tempting for most human beings the world and especially the north american world is in a massive debt crisis it is very easy to borrow money these days and our culture is at the point where buy now pay later is an accepted practice   now that i have young children i will be teaching them the golden rule of do n't buy something until you have cash to pay for it in full it sounds like an over simplification but this one rule will save you an incredible amount of financial grief over time

to issue corporate grade bonds the approval process very nearly matches that for issuing corporate equity you must register with the sec and then generally there is a initial debt offering similar to an ipo i say similar in terms of the process itself but the actual sale of bonds is nothing like that for equities it would be rare for a partnership to be that large as to issue debt in the form of bonds although there are some that are pretty big but i suppose it is possible as long as they want to file with the sec    beyond that a business could privately place bonds with a large investor but there is still registration requirements with the sec   all that being said it is also pretty rare for public bonds to be issued by a company that does n't already have public equity and the amounts we are talking about here are huge the most common trade in corporate debt is a round lot of 100,000 so this is n't something a small corporation would have access to or have a need for generally financing for a smaller business comes from a bank

none of your options or strategies are ideal have you considered looking at the stock chart and making a decision is the price currently up trending or is it down trending or is it going sideways as knuckle mentions you could just set a limit price order and if it does not hit by friday you can just sell at whatever price on friday however this could be very damaging if the price is currently down trending it may fall considerably by friday i think a better strategy would be to place a trailing stop loss order say 5 from the current price if the stock starts heading south you will be stopped out approximately 5 below the current price however if the price goes up your trailing stop order will move up as well always trailing 5 below the highest price reached if the trailing stop has not been hit by friday afternoon you can sell at the current price this way you will be protected on the downside only approx 5 below current price and can potentially benefit from any short term upside

first excellent choice to say no to non subsidized loans but i 'd say you are cutting things very close either way and you need to face up to that now   $ extra at the end of the month is within the noise of financial life meaning you should think of it as essentially $ 0 each month or even negative money since one vet bill school books unforeseen problem could remove it for the entire year easily   you are leaving yourself no buffer but by taking the loan unless you are as joe said socking away savings to pay for it upon graduation you are guaranteeing you 'll leave college with debt which i think should be avoided if you can   could you do a hybrid plan in which you worked hard to do the following if you do these things or something along these lines the loan is probably ok if not i 'd be concerned about taking it probably unnecessary but keep in mind that student loans are not by bankruptcy so one is on the hook for them no matter what also consider whether you can take a semester off now and then to catch up financially   the key is to really stay far from the edge of any financial

why there is this huge difference i am not able to reconcile yahoo 's answer of 5.75 even using their definition for of return on assets formula earnings from continuing operations average total equity this ratio shows percentage of returns to total assets of the company    this is a useful measure in analyzing how well a company uses its    assets to produce earnings i suspect the average total equity in their formula is a typo but using either measure i can not come up with 5.75 for any 12-month period i can however match marketwatch 's answer by looking at the 2016 fiscal year totals and using a traditional formula of net income average total assets i 'm not saying that is right and yahoo is wrong mw is using fiscal year totals while yahoo is using trailing 12-month numbers and yahoo uses earnings from continuing operations but even using that number which yahoo calculates i am not able to reconcile the 5.75 they give

there is one other factor that i have n't seen mentioned here   it 's easy to assume that if you buy a stock then someone else another stock owner must have sold it to you   this is not true however because there are people called market makers whose basic job is to always be available to buy shares from those who wish to sell and sell shares to those who wish to buy   they could be selling you shares they just bought from someone else but they also could simply be issuing shares from the company itself that have never been bought before this is a super oversimplified explanation but hopefully it illustrates my point

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

should n't withdraw stock investments for at least 5 years would be better re phrased as do n't invest money in stocks if you really need it within next few years the underlying principle is stocks are one of the higher risk investment classes out there   while that 's exactly what you want over a long time horizon longer than the and flow of the broader economy if you know you 'll definitely have to withdraw $ 50k or any large chunk of it within just a few years it 's possible that a great long term vehicle like stocks could actually rob you of money on a shorter time horizon so if you want to start a business 2 years from now you 'll probably want to retain some of that $ 300k initial pile in lower risk investment vehicles e.g. bonds cds certain etfs and mutual funds aimed at capital preservation etc that said interest rates are so low that if you 're flexible with how much money you 'll need to start that business i 'd probably keep as much as you can stomach in diversified stocks per your original plan

at the moment you are paying about $ 1,300 interest each month £ 12 on your mortgage and repaying capital at about $ 1,500 per month paying $ 11,000 off your mortgage would save you about $ 9,000 as it is reduces your balance by about seven monthly capital repayments but you will only see this benefit at the end of the mortgage because you will pay it off seven months earlier there is only about $ 1,000 interest remaining on your car loans paying the $ 11,000 off your interest free loan then paying extra the interest bearing loan brings that down to $ 500 and paying it off your interest bearing loan brings it down to $ 200 either way both car loans would be finished by early 2018 in summary if you use the $ 11,000 against your car loans you will save $ less than paying it off the mortage but you will have no car loans in one year rather than three google spreadsheet for calculations here

debit cards have a certain processing delay lag time before the transaction from the vendor completes with your bank in the us it 's typically 3 business days but i have seen even a 15 day lag from panera bread i guess in the uk payment processors have similar processing delays a business is not obliged to run its payment processing in realtime as that 's very expensive whatever be the lag time your bank is supposed to cover the payment you promised through your card now if you do n't have agreements in place for example overdraft with your bank they will likely have to turn down payments that exceed your available balance here is the raw deal in the end the responsibility to ensure that your available balance is enough is upon you and whether you have agreements in place to handle such situations so what happened is very much legal a business is not obliged to run its payment processing in realtime and no ethics are at stake to ensure such things do not happen to me i used to use a sub account from which my debit card used to get paid i have since moved to credit cards as the hassle of not overdrawing was too much and overdraft fees from banks in the us are disastrous especially for people who actually need such a facility

i believe tom au answered your key question let me just add in response to what if someone was just simply rich to buy > 50 but does not know how to handle the company this happens all the time bob senior is a brilliant business man he starts a company it is wildly successful then he dies and bob junior inherits the company if it 's a privately owned company he may inherit it directly if it 's a corporation he inherits a controlling interest in the stock bob junior knows nothing about how to run a business and so he the company runs it into the ground and eventually it goes bankrupt stock holders lose their investment employees lose their jobs and in general everyone is very unhappy i suppose it also happens that someone gets rich doing thing a and then decides that he 's going to buy a business that does thing b. he has no idea how to run a business doing thing b and he destroys the company i ca n't think of any specific examples of this off the top of my head but i 've heard of it happening with people who make a ton of money as actors or professional athletes and then decide to start a business

the standard advice is that stocks are all over the place and bonds are stable not necessarily true magazines have to write for the lowest common denominator reader so sometimes the advice given is fortune cookie like and like mbhunter pointed out the advertisers influence the advice when you read about the wonders of index funds and see a full page ad for vanguard or the nasdaq spdr fund you need to consider the motivation behind the advice if i were you i would take advantage of current market conditions and take some profits put as much as 20 in cash   if you 're going to buy bonds look for us government or municipal security bond funds for about 10 of your portfolio you 're not at an age where investment income matters you 're just looking for some safety so look for bond funds or etfs with low durations low duration protects your principal value against rate swings the vanguard fund is a good example $ 100k is a great pot of money for building wealth but it 's a job that requires you to be active informed and engaged plan on spending 4 8 hours a week researching your investments and looking for new opportunities if you ca n't spend that time think about getting a professional fee based advisor always keep cash so that you can take advantage of opportunities without creating a taxable event or make a rash decision to sell something because you 're excited about a new opportunity

one of the often cited advantages of etfs is that they have a higher    liquidity and that they can be traded at any time during the trading    hours on the other hand they are often proposed as a simple way to    invest private funds for people that do not want to always keep an eye    on the market hence the intraday trading is mostly irrelevant for    them i am pretty sure that this is a subjective idea the fact is you may buy goog aapl f or whatever you as well such as qqq spy etc and keep them for a long time in both cases if you do not want to keep an on the market it is ok because if you keep them it is called idea is collecting dividends etc if you are day trading then is it called speculation because you main goal is to earn by buying and selling of course you may loose as well so you do not care about dividends or owning some percent of the company as etfs are derived instruments their volatility depends on the volatility of the related shares i 'm wondering whether there are secondary effects that make the    liquidity argument interesting for private investors despite not    using it themselves what would these effects be and how do they    impact when compared for example to mutual funds to turn cash could create high volatility which means high risk and high reward from this point of view mutual funds are more safe because money managers know how to diversify the total portfolio and manage income under any market conditions

you can hold a wide variety of investments in your tfsa account including stocks such as but if the stocks are being purchased via a company stock purchase plan they are typically deposited in a regular margin account with a brokerage firm a few companies may issue physical stock certificates but that is very rare these days that account would not be a tfsa but you can perform what 's called an in kind transfer to move them into a tfsa that you open with either the same brokerage firm or a different one there will be a fee for the transfer check with the brokerage that currently holds the stock to find out how costly that will be assuming the stock gained in value while you held it outside the tfsa this transfer will result in capital gains tax that you 'll have to pay when you file your taxes for the year in which the transfer occurs the tax would be calculated by taking the value at time of transfer minus the purchase price or the market value at time of purchase if your plan allowed you to buy it at a discounted price the discounted amount will be automatically taxed by your employer 50 of the capital gain is added to your annual income when calculating taxes owed   normally when you sell a stock that has lost value you can actually get a capital loss deduction that is used to offset gains that you made in other stocks or redeemed against capital gains tax paid in previous years or carried forward to apply against gains in future years however if the stock decreased in value and you transfer it you are not eligible to claim a capital loss i 'm not sure why you said tfsa for a family member as you can not directly contribute to someone else 's tfsa account you can give them a gift of money or stocks which they can deposit in their tfsa account but that involves that extra step of gifting and the money stocks become their property to do with as they please now that i 've hopefully answered all your questions let me offer you some advice as someone who also participates in an employee stock purchase plan holding stock in the company that you work for is a bad idea the reason is simple if something terrible happens to the company their stock will plummet and at the same time they may be forced to lay off many employees so just at the time when you lose your job and might want to sell your stock suddenly the value of your stocks has gone way down so you really should sell your company shares at least once a year and then use that money to invest in your tfsa account you also do n't want to put all your eggs in one basket you should be spreading your investment among many companies or better yet buy index mutual funds or etfs which hold all the companies in a certain index there 's lots of good info about index investing available at canadian couch potato the types of investments recommended there are all possible to purchase inside a tfsa account to shelter the growth from being taxed edit here is an article from that talks about transferring stocks into a tfsa it also mentions the importance of having a diversified portfolio

gt we 've been deficit spending for generations and we 're trillions in the hole and that 's the psychological issue hanging over our heads   let 's unpack that a bit what does trillions in the hole actually mean for the issuer of the dollar it means that the issuer at various points has to redeem its own interest bearing dollars treasuries for its own non interest bearing dollars reserves notes coins that 's not a hole that 's moving a balance from the savings account to the checking account at the same bank   you do n't think of your savings account balance as the bank being in the hole for checking account balances you implicitly understand that the bank simply marks down the number in one account and marks up the number in the other and you do n't fret that the bank might run out of checking account balances   treasuries have this same relationship to reserves not similar not analogous to but the same treasury securities are literally interest bearing accounts at the federal reserve reserves are literally demand accounts at the federal reserve when a treasury matures a treasury securities account is marked down a reserve account is marked up when a treasury is issued a treasury securities account is marked up and a reserve account is marked down   what you 're thinking of as trillions in the hole is just trillions in a savings account balance   that 's what it means to have debt in a currency that you are the issuer of and why foreign denominated debt is fundamentally different   gt;so we can design a system that will keep inflation low while we dump money into the economy   we already have that there 's no inflation monster under the bed if there 's an inflation problem it 's that we 're so paranoid about it we 're not putting enough money into the economy and so unnecessary misery on ourselves   gt the issue in my mind with dumping money while the debt situation is such a concern is that speculators could the bed and devalue our currency   there 's nothing a speculator can do vs a sovereign currency that the issuing central bank ca n't offset so if you are a sovereign and the issuing central bank is within and beneath your authority you have the last word and there 's no such thing as bond   in contrast if you take on sovereign obligations denominated in currencies where the issuing central bank sits outside your authority as is the case when you borrow peg to foreign currency or enter a monetary union like the euro you become just another currency user here your government actually is kinda like a household and can go broke in that foreign   consider how that perspective sheds light on the mystery of why some countries actually experience a debt crisis and others do n't why contrary to all the someplace like japan for example can have 200 debt gdp and near zero interest rates and no sovereign debt crisis it 's because japan issues the yen sets the interest rate on the yen and ca n't run out of yen   people who do n't understand this are what gave the hedge funds feeling confident about the trade in 12 its name time after time they line up to place bets on japanese government bond crisis they 're always wrong and always will be

for the us government they 've just credited person b with a million usd and have n't gained anything afterall those digits are intangible and do n't really have a value imo two flaws in this reasoning the us government did n't do anything the receiving bank credited the recipient if the digits are intangible such that they have n't gained anything they have n't lost anything either in practice the role of governments in the transfer is purely supervisory the sending bank debits the sender 's account and the receiving bank credits the recipient 's account every intermediary makes some money on this transaction because the cost to the sender exceeds the credit to the recipient the sending bank typically receives a credit to their account at a correspondent bank the receiving bank typically receives a debit from their account at a correspondent bank if a bank sends lots of money eventually its account at its correspondent will run dry if a bank receives lots of money eventually its account at its correspondent will have too much money this is resolved with domestic payments sometimes handled by governmental or quasi governmental agencies in the us banks have an account with the federal reserve and adjust balances there the international component is handled by the correspondent bank(s they also internally will credit and debit if they get an imbalance between two currencies they ca n't easily correct they will have to sell one currency to buy the other fortunately worldwide currency exchange is extremely efficient

the stock market is no different in this respect to anything that 's bought or sold the price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it if those things match then a transaction can take place the seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value the reverse happens for the buyer take buying a house for example did the buyer lose money when they bought a house sure they did but they gained a house the seller gained money but lost a house new money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits those profits together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company if we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too the value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things it likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials stocks do have an inherent value they are ownership of a part of a company you own part of the asset value profits and losses made by that company betting on things is different in that you 've no ownership of the thing you bet on you 're only dependent on the outcome of the bet

when portfolio positions are reported in percentages those percentages are relative to the portfolio 's base equity   when you start out that is equal to the cash you have in a portfolio   later it 's the net equity of the portfolio i.e. how much money you could withdraw if you were to exit all your positions if you put $ 5,000 into your account and are long and short 50 then you are long $ 2,500 and short $ 2,500   if it 's 100 and -100 then long and short $ 5,000 leverage is often computed gross as if all positions were long   so if you have 100 and -100 then your broker may say you are levered 2 to 1   that is your gross exposure is twice as large as your underlying base equity

i 'm not 100 certain on boats since they are n't typically sold for a gain but the tax base of an asset is typically the cost of the asset plus the cost of any improvements so your $ 15,000 gain looks right check with a cpa to be certain though if you can   your cost basis would be $ 50,000 + $ 25,000 = $ 75,000 and your net gain would be $ 90,000 $ 75,000 = $ 15,000   the result is the same but the arithmetic is organized a little differently i am fairly confident you can not include your time in the cost of improvements   if you incorporated and paid yourself for the time then the payment would be considered income and taxed if it was even allowed depending on your tax bracket that may be a worse option for you you can look at it this way you only pay the tax on the $ 15k gain versus paying someone else $ 15k to do the labor

are you sure you 're not just looking at prices that are adjusted for the split e.g. yahoo for example gilead sciences split a few months ago but if you look at a price chart there is n't an interruption even though the split is clearly marked look in the past six months it split in january however you could also simply be watching companies that happen to not split for a variety of reasons this is n't a criticism but rather just a consequence of whatever stocks you happen to be watching   however a quick search for information on stock splits yields a few articles mainly from the motley fool that argue that fewer companies are performing stock splits in recent years the articles mainly talk about tech companies and they make the argument that even though the shares in google and apple have a high stock price google and apple are n't all that expensive by traditional valuation    metrics google trades at just 15 times next year 's projected    profitability apple a mere 13 times fiscal 2012 's bottom line estimates these articles are a bit dated in terms of the stock prices but the rationale is probably still good similar logic could apply for other companies for example since may 2009 panera 's stock price has climbed by almost a factor of 4 without splitting the articles also make the point that stock splits were traditionally seen as bullish signs because companies splitting to bring their share prices back down to more    accessible levels were optimistic in building those sand back    up one could make a fair argument that the overall economic climate is n't as bullish as it used to be although i would only be convinced that this was affecting stock splits if data could be gathered and tested a stock split can also raise the price of a stock because if small investors feel the stock is suddenly more accessible to them they purchase more of it and might therefore drive up the price see the investopedia article on stock splits for more information companies might not see the necessity in doing this because their stock price is n't high enough to warrant a split or because the price is n't high enough to smaller investors   one interesting point to make however is that even though stock splits can drive small investors to buy more of the stock this is n't always a gain for the company because professional investors firms institutions etc have a tendency to sell after a split the paper is a bit old but it 's still a very neat read it 's possible that more and more companies no longer see any advantage to splitting because it might not affect their stock price in the long run and arguably could even hurt it considering that large professional investors likely hold a higher percentage of a company 's shares than smaller investors if a stock split triggers a wave of selling by the former the increasing propensity to buy of the latter may not be enough to offset the decline in price   note my answer only refers to standard stock splits the reasons above may not apply to a decrease in the number of reverse stock splits which may not be a phenomenon i do n't know

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

first of all any loan will have the last payment be slightly different than the rest even if the interest rate is zero it is hard to have a perfect monthly payment amount by perfect i mean the amount of the loan divided by the number of months would be $   when looking at the amortization table the last payment will either be slightly higher or lower to adjust for the rounding that was done my suspicion is that the rounding would have resulted in a left over 12 cents it is also possible that you are paying it off slightly early and the computer is simply taking the leftover amount an spreading it over the remaining period of the loan you could be paying it early because for the main part of the loan was paid to a company that rounds all payments to the higher dollar or has a minimum monthly payment amount i looked at the company you mentioned in the question and searched the site for an amortization tool i found it and used the pre filled in example if that last payment is not adjusted the borrower will still owe $ 0.12 the fact it equals your situation is a coincidence but is does show what can happen

the advantage of having a mortgage rather than borrowing money in other ways is that it is cheaper because the loan is secured against the value of the property   if you stop paying then the bank take the house and can sell it keeping what they are owed and returning any excess if you have enough money to pay it off then you do not need the mortgage   they normally run for 25 years   it is a lovely day when finally you realise that you own the whole house and no longer owe anything to the bank and the charge against the house is removed and the record of it removed from the land registry    when you sell a house with a mortgage the buyer has to check that the bank has been paid off before they accept the property

my original answer contained a fundamental error it turns out that it is not true that any exchange can create its own product to track any underlying index   if the underlying index is copyrighted such as the s&p indices russell indices dow jones indices etc then the exchange must enter into a licensing agreement usually exclusive with the copyright holder in order to use the index 's formula and name   without such a license the exchange would only be able to approximate the underlying index and i do n't think that happens very much because how would you market such a product the cme offers several futures and other derivatives whose face value is equivalent to some multiple of the s&p500 's value on the date when the product expires   when such a product is actively traded it may serve as a reasonable indicator of the market 's expectation of the s&p500 's future value so you could pay attention to the front month of the cme 's s&p 500 mini future which trades from chicago time sunday night through friday afternoon   but remember that the prices quoted there are as another example if you care about the russell 2000 index until 2017 the ice exchange happened to hold the license for its derivatives   they traded from new york time sunday night through friday afternoon   but in cme bought that license as well so now you 'll want to track it here moral there 's almost always some after hours product out there tracking whatever index you care about but you may have to do some digging to find it and it might not be all that useful for your specific purpose

it is often the case more commonly in countries other than the usa that a fixed term loan has an early redemption penalty because the lender themselves will incur a cost for settling the loan early while a variable rate loan does not if this is the situation and you think you might want to pay off the loan early you should definitely consider the variable rate rather than then fixed rate

imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of x. as time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items length of credit outweigh your negative items but there are no big increases or decrease in your score then you make a one time change to how you use credit if this is a event that helps your score there will be a increase in your score if it is bad thing your score will drop but if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely overtime the impact will lessen and the score will return your your normal range spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money

yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor

no it wo n't affect your score until your statement is posted paying your bill before your statement is posted is actually a good way to keep your credit utilization low if you 're worried about high credit utilization negatively affecting your credit score consider paying your bill several times a month to ensure that when your final monthly statement is posted your utilization is still low when my credit limit was very low while i was in college i did this almost every month and i 've seen other sites recommend this practice as well from creditkarma.com the easiest way to lower credit utilization is to make credit card payments more than once a month so that your balance never gets too high and consider making payments to creditors more than once each month otherwise if you put a major expense like a new appliance on a credit card even if you plan to pay it off your fico score may take a hit the reason is that credit scores are calculated as a snapshot in time so if that happens to be right after you charged a new $ 700 washing machine your utilization ratio will look high remember though that it 's best to have some balance on your card when your statement is posted assuming you pay it off in full each month because as the chart shows 0 utilization is about as bad as utilization > 31 40   also remember that credit utilization affects your credit score in real time so if you have high utilization one month but a lower utilization the next month the hit to your score will disappear once a statement with low utilization is posted

maybe everyone who has responded needs to look closer at the income base repayment plan for student loans what this means is he payment does not even cover his interest rate so each month he makes his payment the loan grows does not decrease this is not a simple interest loan which is irritating because car dealerships do not even use a non simple interest loan any longer so well your suggestions are well intended what is your suggestion now knowing that his monthly payments is not reducing his loan but actually his loan is growing exponentially each month i also like the comment where the average student loan is $ 30,000 i would like to know in what state that is that may work for a community college or a student who is reliant on parents to supplement their income so they can go to classes however for someone who is working and going to school that person must opt out for night classes and online classes which definitely increases the cost of your classes right now the cost per credit hour is in the $ range

ah yes   the filthy rich have let us use their equipment and their buildings so we can be thankful that they artificially increase prices with virtual monopolies and take their manufacturing jobs out of country creating an reduction in labor wages   i ’m totally thankful that they are rich enough to control politics and tell us how thankful we should be for it   yes big money has done and used to do great things   these days however the cash that is n’t bent towards directly making more money is bent towards putting policies in place to make them more money   there is no recognition of how will this impact the populace at large     do you remember that age old question they put to inventors   you asked if you could but never stopped to ask if you should   we have let money control so much that people have become worth less than big money ’s interests   thank the gods we live in a country that treats money better than people because that is n’t going poorly at all /s

one of the other things you could do to improve your score would be along the lines of what pete said in his answer but using the current financial climate to your advantage i 'm not sure what interest rates are available to you in the uk but i currently have 4 lines of credit aside from my house one is a credit card i use for every day purchases and like you pay off immediately with every statement the other three are technically credit cards however all three were used to make purchases with 0 financing the one was for a tv i bought that even gave me 5 off if i pay it off within 6 months that cash has been sitting in my savings since the day i bought it i 'm making regular payments on all three but not having to pay any interest my credit score dropped 25 points with the one as it was an elective medical expense eye surgery so for the time the balance is near my credit limit however that will bounce back up as the balance lowers my score was also able to take that hit and still be very high if you do n't have 0 or very close available your better bet would be to follow the other suggestions about saving for a sizable down payment or other every day expenses like a cell phone

yes depending on what you 're trying to achieve if its just a symbolic gift you can use a service like this there are several companies providing this service look them up but the prices are fairly the same you 'll end up getting a real stock certificate but it will cost a lot of overhead around $ 40 to get the certificate and then another $ 40 to deposit it into a brokerage account if you want to sell it on a stock exchange so although the certificate is real and the person whose name on it is a full blown shareholder it does n't actually have much value unless you buy a google or apple stock where the price is much much higher than the fees take into account that it takes around 2 months for the certificate to be issued and mailed to you so time accordingly otherwise you can open a custodial brokerage account and use it to buy stocks for the minor both ways are secure and legal each for its own purpose and with its own fees

equity is the term to make things balance in a simple transaction you get $ 100 paid to you income goes up by $ 100 and the asset of whatever bank account or petty cash drawer you put it into also goes up by $ 100 equity is unchanged if for some reason you had to take some income into your books but no asset increased no debt decreased and you had no way to take an offsetting expense into your books then this would lower your equity how else to explain having earned $ 100 but having nothing to show for it

there absolutely is a specific model that makes this so popular with so many credit card companies and that model is per transaction fees card companies also receive cost sharing incentives from certain merchants there is also a psychological reasoning as an additional incentive when you want to accept credit cards as a source of payment as a business you generally have three kinds of fees to pay monthly yearly subscription fees percentage of transaction fee and per transaction fee   the subscription fees can be waived and sometimes are expressed as a minimum cost so the business pays a certain amount whether you actually have people use credit cards or not many of these fees do n't actually make it to the credit card companies as they just pay the service providers and middle men processing companies the percentage of transaction fee means that the business accepting payment via credit card must pay a percentage usually ranging from 1 3 of the total transactions they accept so if they get paid $ 10,000 a month by customers in the form of credit cards the business pays out $ 100 300 a month to the credit card processor a good portion of which will make it back to the credit card issuing company and is a major source of income for them the per transaction fee means that every time a transaction is run involving a card a set fee is incurred by the business which is commonly anywhere from $ 0.05 to $ 0.30 per transaction if that $ 10,000 a month business mentioned previously had 10 customers paying $ 1,000 each at $ 0.10 a transaction that 's only $ 1 in fees to the credit card processors companies but if instead that business was a grocery store with an average transaction of $ 40 that 's $ 25 in fees   this system means that if you are a credit card company and want to encourage people to make a specific kind of purchase you should encourage purchases that people make many times for relatively small amounts of money in a perfect world you 'd want them to buy $ 1 bottles of water 5 times a day with their credit card if the card company had 50,000 card holders doing this at the end of 1 year the company would have $ spread across transactions the card company might reasonably make $ 0.05 per transaction and 1 of the purchase total the get rewarded for drinking more campaign might earn the card company $ in percentage fees and over $ 4.5 million in transaction fees yet the company would only have to pay 3 in rewards from the percentage fees or $ 2.7 million back to customers if the card company had encouraged using your credit card for large once yearly purchases they would actually pay out more money in rewards than they collect in card use fees yet by encouraging people to make small transactions very often the card company earns a nice net income even if absolutely every customer pays their balance in full on time and pays no annual monthly fees for their card which obviously does not happen in the real world no wonder companies try so hard to encourage you to use your card all the time for card companies to make real money they need you to use your credit card as discussed above the more often you use the card the better for them and there can be a built in preference for small repeated transactions but no matter what the size of transaction they ca n't make the big bucks if you do n't use the card at all selling your personal information is n't as profitable if they do n't have in depth info on you to sell either so how do they get you to make that plastic sing gas and groceries are a habit most people buy one or the other at least once a weak and a very large number of us make such purchases multiple times a week some people even make such purchases multiple times a day so how do people pay for such transactions the goal of the card companies is to have you use their product to pay as much as possible if you pay for something regularly you 'll keep that card in your wallet with you rather than it getting lost in a drawer at home so the card companies want you to use your card as a matter of habit too if you use a card to buy for gas and groceries why would n't you use it for other things too lunch dinner buying online if the card company pays out more and makes less for large less regular purchases then the ideal for them is to have you use the card for small regular purchase and yet still have you use the card for larger infrequent purchases even if you get reduced no rewards what better way to achieve all these goals than to offer special rewards on gas and groceries and because it 's not a one time purchase you are n't so likely to game the system no getting that special 5 cash back card booking your once per decade dream vacation then paying it off and cancelling it soon after which would actually make the card company lose money on the deal in the end credit card companies as a whole have a business model that almost universally prefers customers who use their products regularly and preferably for small amounts a maximum number of times they want to reduce their expenses like rewards paid out while maximizing their revenue they have n't figured out a better way to do all of this so well as to encourage people to use their cards for gas and groceries everything else seems like a losing proposition in comparison the only time this preference differs is when they can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards such as when the merchants themselves honor the rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies so if you use an airline card that seems to give you 10 back in airline rewards well that 's probably a great deal for the card company if the airline provides that reward at their own expense to try to boost business the card company keeps the transaction related fees and pays out almost nothing in rewards the perfect offer for them   and this assumes no shenanigans like black out periods not valid with any other offers rewards like on cars where only a fool pays full msrp and sometimes the rewards are tagged in this sort of way like not valid on sale clearance items etc expiring rewards the fact that they know not everyone uses their rewards annual fees that are greater than the rewards you 'll actually be obtaining after accounting for all the other issues etc and credit card industries are known for their shenanigans

i would just take $ 2000 and multiply by your marginal tax rate weight that between the 5 other people according to their share of the prize money and ask them to give you that from your question it seems like you all have a good working relationship i 'm sure the other partners would agree to that i think it 's the simplest solution that is also fair and equitable basically you pay the tax on 2000 and they pay you back for their share of the tax much easier than trying to pass it through your tax return for 5 separate people for a minimal amount of $ 's in hindsight the best way to do it would have been to 1099 the person with the lowest marginal tax rate for the year to minimize the total tax paid on the 2000 probably only would've been a few dollars difference but still the most efficient way to do it

as discusses tax bracket without any refers to a single jurisdiction 's marginal tax rate   in your case this is either your california 's tax bracket or your federal tax bracket not including marginal social security and medicare taxes   but if someone says combined state and federal tax bracket they probably mean the combination of your state and federal income tax brackets again lot including sales taxes business and occupational taxes social security taxes and medicare taxes   the math to combine the state and federal marginal tax rates is a bit tricky because most people can deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes when computing their income for federal income tax purposes   the federal alternative minimum tax restricts this deduction for some people for a single person earning $ 100,000 of salaries and wages in california whose state income taxes are close to their standard deduction the calculations for the combined marginal income tax rate look something like this as mentioned above this the tax bite on marginal earned income   to find the true marginal rate we need to add in social security taxes medicare taxes sales taxes and business occupation taxes   the social security and medicare taxes are sometimes called self employment taxes   this math unemployment insurance and workers compensation insurance because those taxes are typically capped well below $ 100,000 per year of income   this math also b o taxes because this question is california specific if an employer wishes to increase an employee 's pay by $ the first $ will go to the employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the remaining $ 1,000.00 will be subject to the combined marginal income tax rate discussed above plus will have $ go to the employee 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the employee might buy some extra things with some of their extra money and pay sales tax on them in 2016 a 9 sales tax rate was common in california 's largest cities the irs estimated that for a single person with no dependents making $ 100,000 per year who did not buy a boat rv motor vehicle or major home construction about 9 of their marginal gross income was subject to sales tax

i believe that it 's not possible for the public to know what shares are being exchanged as shorts because broker dealers not the exchanges handle the shorting arrangements   i do n't think exchanges can even tell the difference between a person selling a share that belongs to her vs. a share that she 's just borrowing   there are sec regulations requiring some traders to declare that trades are shorts but a i do n't think this applies to all traders b it only applies to the sells and c this information is n't public that being said you can view the short interest in a symbol using any of a number of tools such as nasdaq 's here   this is often cited as an indicator similar to what you proposed though i do n't know how helpful it would be from an intra day perspective

the can and the should have been discussed in other answers and comments   and so i will discuss the how   as others have noted it is important to make sure that the additional money goes to reducing principal and not towards   prepayment of interest   unfortunately very few bank tellers understand how mortgages work and very few bank officers even loan officers understand how mortgages work too thus a statement that you want the extra money to go towards principal will likely be met with a blank look furthermore what they do with the money and how it is entered on the bank books that afternoon when the transactions are recorded may have no to what was discussed and agreed to earlier in the day   based on my personal experiences and   many arguments with banks about how they handled my prepayments and how interest was computed i would   recommend the following which is easier now that automated payments are possible for the standard monthly payment and additional payments are possible via electronic funds transfer make sure that automated payments are made on the day that the payment is due not at the end of the ten day grace period that banks love to grant you for making the monthly payment yes there is no penalty for late payment as long as you pay before the end of the grace period but interest continues to be charged and so more of each delayed payment goes to interest   and less towards principal make the additional payment on the same day as the standard monthly mortgage payment is made this ensures that at worst just one day 's interest is owing when the additional payment is made also payment in the middle of the monthly cycle is an almost sure way of getting ripped off on the interest because the bank 's computers will post the payment in the manner most favorable to them and usually contrary to the terms of your mortgage   i have   complained to banks about mid month payments and won every time and on many occasions the bank officer would say we have always done it this way and nobody   ever complained till you did today i doubt very much if the bank 's programs got changed as a result of my complaints if you are not sure how mortgages work and how interest   is calculated or do n't have the time or inclination to go hassle with the bank each time but do prefer not to get ripped off make the payment as described on the dot and at the same time as the regularly scheduled monthly payment the amortization schedule that the bank should have given you shows how much the principal amount is after the monthly   payment is made on each due date   assuming that you have   not been taking advantage of the grace periods and so the schedule is correct make an additional payment not of a round sum but an exact amount down to the last penny that will jump you from principal owing after today 's regular payment to principal owing after the regular payment n months from today here of course you choose n based on how much extra money you were planning on paying towards your mortgage   by making the extra payment you will effectively have cut the length of   the mortgage by n months and the same amortization schedule will apply over the shorter period   since very little of the principal is repaid in the early life of the mortgage an additional principal only payment can reduce the length of the mortgage by years paying a specific amount that matches the amortization schedule also helps if you ever need to hassle with the bank it is their print out you are arguing from and not trying to explain to a clueless bank officer how the bank did not compute interest   correctly after you paid $ extra at beginning of last month

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

you make a good point and then abandon it   i agree everything is ultimately attributable to random events or one 's genetics and upbringing   e.g. the worse baker deserves to fail because they are worse at baking   however did they deserve to be born and raised and grow into circumstances that caused them to be a worse baker   very hard to argue that   very hard   i also do n't think it 's suitable to ignore the infinite in most cases you do n't need to trace a person 's history beyond their to explain something so infinite is hardly the word regression you mention     a person 's decisions are the result of their life story up until that point and a person 's life story always begins with circumstances completely beyond their control

no offense to any bankers who are reading but i find it remarkable that they can confuse what i 'd expect to be an otherwise simple explanation if at the end of each day the interest is added you go to sleep with a new balance at the moment it 's added you have no interest due just a higher principal amount than when you went to sleep last night when i view my loan i know how much interest added to principal since the last payment any amount i pay over that has to go to principal forgive me but the rest sounds like nonsense

this is exactly how monopolies are made   allowing a business to use one extremely profitable business to undercut competitors in other areas at below cost mind you   this should be illegal practice   google should be hit hard   while i understand your stance i do n't believe it is creating an equal playing field in the economy and it is hurting it badly    for example no startup out there is going to create an online maps startup even if they have an awesome idea that would make maps better because they do n't have the ability to monetize and survive   google gives their 's away free using their near monopoly on online advertising to subsidize it   you talk about the only exit for a startup being acquired by a larger company   that is exactly the problem   you 're creating unbeatable   google msft apple fb will only grow startups will only have 10 20 companies to exit to   they should be able to survive and grow and compete on their own    groupon was a company that tried to do that and you can see how they 're doing   the tech world is turning into that very oligopoly that you try to caveat    people just do n't realize it     we should break the stranglehold   if people paid for services then their would be more entrants into the market as they could monetize quicker and the best ideas would win vs. the best connections to vcs and having an entrepreneurial track history which is how the bay area works   startups would n't be so dependent on financiers they could monetize their actual client base

a sunk cost is a cost that you have already incurred and wo n't get back the sunk cost fallacy as you described is when you make a bad decision based on your sunk cost   when you identify a sunk cost you realize that the money has been spent and the decision is irreversible   future decisions should not take this cost into account   when you commit the sunk cost fallacy you are keeping something that is bad simply because you spent a lot of money on it   you are failing to identify the correct current value of something based on its high cost to you in the past the other fallacy you describe the opposite of the sunk cost fallacy is when you get rid of something that is good simply because you spent little on it   as before you are also failing to correctly identify the correct current value of something but in this case you are assigning too little a value based on the low cost in the past   you could call this a type of opportunity cost a loss of future benefits due to a mistake made today   it seems reasonable to describe this type of fallacy as an opportunity cost fallacy

your plan sounds quite sound to me   i think that between the choices of $ 800 for loans $ 300 for retirement and $ 1100 for loans both are good choices and you are n't going to go wrong either way    some of the factors you might want to consider i like your retirement savings choices i myself use the admiral version of voo plus a slightly specialized but still large etf that allows me to do a bit of shifting   having something that 's at least a bit counter market can be helpful for balancing so something that will be going up some when the market overall is down some i would n't necessarily do bonds at your age but international markets are good for that or a stock etf that 's more stable than the overall market   if you 're using vanguard look at the minimums for buying admiral shares usually a few grand and aim to get those if possible as they have significantly lower fees though voo seems to pretty much tie the admiral version vfiax so in that case it may not matter so much as far as the target retirement funds you can certainly do those but i prefer not to they have somewhat higher though for vanguard not crazy high expense ratios   realistically you can do the same yourself quite easily

someone messed up here my tax accountant says she is supposed to enter the values as they are on the w2 and said they will not issue a new w2 because they were not involved in the refund of the money correct we decided that we will enter a value different from d subtract the money that was refunded to me because it 's already on the 1099   incorrect is there an alternative to avoid paying taxes twice on the 401k if not is there a better way to do this to minimize the risk of an audit you should enter the amounts in w2 as they are otherwise things wo n't tie at the irs and they will come back asking questions the amount in box was deducted from your wages pre tax so you did n't pay tax on it the distribution is taxable and if it was made before the tax day next year only taxable once so if you withdrew the same year of the contribution as it sounds like you did you will only pay tax on it once because the amounts were not included in your salary if the 1099-r is marked with the correct code the irs will be able to match the excess contribution box and the removal of the excess contribution 1099-r with the code and it will all tie no one will audit you the accountant is probably clueless as to how her software works by default the accounting software will add the excess contribution on w2 box back into wages and it will be added to taxable income on your tax return however when you type in the 1099 with the proper code this should be reversed by the software and if it is not should be manually this should be done at the adjustment entry not the w2 entry screen since a copy of the w2 will be transmitted with your tax return and should match the actual w2 transmitted by your employer if she does n't know what she 's doing find someone who does

i am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far   here 's the deal it probably does help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it is n't a hassle but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary   here 's why a key component of your score is your credit usage ratio that is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using you want to keep this number down as low as possible now here is where it gets tricky although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest the credit card companies do n't generally report the balance as of the due date they either report the high balance or an average balance over the month that is it is based on how much you use not how much balance you carry over each month it is n't very intuitive but that 's just how it is so technically keeping that balance lower over the course of the month will probably help you but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months so the effect will wear off quickly so it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary small bump another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value     1 you probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks 2 if you have a major financial emergency e.g. broken down car you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month

yes when exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction so if the stock is worth $ 1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $ 0.50 you will spend $ 500 when you exercise your options if you hold those shares and the company is then worth $ 0 you lost $ 500 i have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance please verify with your accountant to be sure

as a young investor you should know that the big secret is that profitable long term investing is boring   it is is not buying one day and selling the next and keeping very close tabs on your investments and jumping on the computer and going buy sell that makes brokers rich but not you so look at investments but not everyday and find something else that 's exciting whether it 's dirt biking or wow or competitive python coding   as a 19 year old you have a ton of time and you do n't need to swing for the fences and make 50 or 30 or even 20 returns every year to do well and you do n't have to pick the best performing stocks and if you do you don;t have to buy them at their lowest or sell them at their highest   go read a random walk 's guide to investing by burton malkiel and the only investment guide you 'll ever need by andrew buy them at used bookstores because it 's cheaper that way   and if you want more excitement read you can be   a stock market genius by joel greenblatt one up on wall street by peter lynch something by warren buffet and if you want to be really read fooled by randomness by nassim nicholas but never forget about and malkiel invest a regular amount of money every month from 19 to 65 according to what they write and you 'll be a wealthy guy by 65

i moved from contributing 10 to maxing as my salary rose over the course of three years after graduation   because of my raises my monthly take home still increased so it was a pretty painless way to increase my 401(k contribution and also avoid lifestyle inflation that said i would not do it if you have any credit card debt school loans or an auto loan   pay that off first   then work on maxing the 401(k   personally i rate owning a home behind that but that 's partially because i 'm in an area where the rent ratios are barely on the side of buying so i do n't find buying to be a pressing matter one thing to investigate is if your company offers a roth 401(k option   it 's a nice option where you can go roth without worrying about income limits   my personal experience does not include a roth ira because when i still qualified for one i did n't know much about them and now that i know about them i have the happy issue of not qualifying

what could happen to bonds such as these because of detroit filing for    bankruptcy depending on how the courts process detroit 's situation there could be that some bonds become worthless since they are so low and the city ca n't pay anything on those low priority debts   others may get pennies on the dollar   there could also be the case that some bailout comes along that makes the bonds good though i 'd say that is a long shot at this point are these bonds done for or will bondholders receive interest    payments and eventual payment i would n't suspect that they are done for in the sense of being completely worthless though at the same time i 'd be very careful about buying any of them given that they are likely to be changed a great deal could these bonds tend to rise over time after the bankruptcy   yes it is possible   if there was some kind of federal or state bailout that is done the bonds could rise   however that is one heck of an if as you 'd need to have someone come to guarantee the bonds in a sense what similar situations from the past might support this idea not that many as this is the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever but here are a few links that may be useful as a starting point though keep in mind detroit 's scale is part of the story as it is such a big amount being defaulted

serious answer this would be a horrible idea for you so do n't do it   theoretical answer   this gets more complicated   if you are refusing to pay your student loans this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment   you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off     however you also stimulate the economy by buying goods   i 'm just an armchair economist but i would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods   now lets say you never say your not paying of your loans and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods   now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money and you are injecting real money through your payment   so you essentially made more money for the economy   so long as the system believes you can pay of the debt the system is able to hold more money   this is actually why most credit companies want you to pay the minimum balance that and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed

gt one of the best news i 've heard today that 's the right way awesome gesture   i do n't know on this one while it gives the warm all it means in reality is the seats will be all be sold out really fast    the economist in me that i pretend to be while listening to freakonomics in my car wants to point to this quote that i feel turned me around on this   and consumer surplus is one of the most important things in economics one of the incredible of the market system is that for so much of what we buy we would have been willing to pay way more for it than we actually have to a great example is water how much do we pay for water each month i do n’t know what your water bill is mine is maybe $ 40 but think about how much we ’d be willing to pay for water water is i mean we ’d be willing to pay almost anything for water but it ’s really really cheap so in that way the modern economy has arranged things so that we get things we need like water and food much more cheaply than we ’d be willing to pay and that is really important that is really the magic of the market    gt to me what sounds like the problem is how do you measure that because i need to know what you in your head were willing to pay before you came to the store and then were confronted with the actual price so how typically have economists measured those two numbers what you pay and what you ’re willing to pay   gt so you have never been more right about anything in your life than what you just said because we simply have no good ways to measure consumer surplus because we know what people pay we can sometimes see that observe how much they buy but we never see what ’s inside their head what their choice what they would be willing to pay if we ’re really going to estimate a consumer surplus what you would want to do is you would want to take a consumer and somehow magically you ’d want to reproduce that consumer in 10 parallel universes   source

sorry but i think you really do need an attorney here this is the kind of where knowing all the precedents and edge cases can make a huge difference in what you can or ca n't do and a misplaced can make or break your case note that at best you could sell your own interest in the house owning the note does not mean owning the property it only means that they issued the note on the strength of your share of the property and a half interest in a single family house has little value outside the family except to sell it to whoever owns the other half which is probably the best answer sell your half to your aunt if she can afford to buy it she then gets sole control of the house and you get the money you seem to need right now and everyone in the family is much less stressed

the motley fool suggested a good rule of thumb in one of their articles that may be able to help you determine if the market is overheating determine the entire cost of rent for a piece of property so if rent is $ 300/month total cost over a year is $ 3600 compare that to the cost of buying a similar piece of property by dividing the property price by the rent per year so if a similar property is $ 90,000 the ratio would be $ = 25 if the ratio is < 20 you should consider buying a place if its > 20 there 's a good chance that the market is overheated   this method is clearly not foolproof but it helps quantify the irrationality of some individuals who think that buying a place is always better than renting   p.s. if anyone can find this article for me i 'd greatly appreciate it i 've tried to use my google fu with googling terms with site but have n't found the article i remember

from irs publication 970 tax benefits for education note qualified tuition programs are also called 529 plans   changing the designated beneficiary there are no income tax consequences if the designated beneficiary of    an account is changed to a member of the beneficiary 's family see    members of the beneficiary 's family earlier   members of the beneficiary 's family for these purposes the beneficiary 's family includes the    beneficiary 's spouse and the following other relatives of the    beneficiary regarding ownership changes rollovers any amount distributed from a qtp is n't taxable if it is rolled over    to another qtp for the benefit of the same beneficiary or for the    benefit of a member of the beneficiary 's family including the    beneficiary 's spouse an amount is rolled over if it is paid to    another qtp within 60 days after the date of the distribution do n't report qualifying rollovers those that meet the above criteria    anywhere on form 1040 or 1040nr these are n't taxable distributions example when aaron graduated from college last year he had $ 5,000 left in his    qtp he wanted to give this money to his younger brother who was in    junior high school in order to avoid paying tax on the distribution    of the amount remaining in his account aaron contributed the same    amount to his brother 's qtp within 60 days of the distribution so it appears that as far as the irs in concerned the rollover could be done to change ownership as long as the beneficiary was in the same family it is possible that there could be a state tax issue with the change of ownership if it changed from a plan in state a to one in state b and state a treated the original contributions as a tax deduction so check the guidelines for the specific 529 plan

more costs are going to be put on the consumer but that is something that would happen all the time originally those systems were not built with the expectation that average life expectancy would jump from almost a factor of a third 60 to 80 years if you wonder why the age of retirement is 65 and not more or less check out and kaiser on that subject additionally the current age population pyramid of the west and asian soon to come is put an increasing pressure on the cost of healthcare   now to me the biggest issue with the us is the belief that market driven economies will always lower prices the problem is that the insurance companies in this country form an oligopoly with the goal to make profits now here is the important question is healthcare a need or a want if it is a want then someone can live without it but if you have an accident or anything of that type then is it still a want or a need you can live without tv all your life and nothing bad may happen to you no healthcare and then you can get screwed for your life   because people will feel compelled to save themselves and be brought to the hospital those who can afford it or need it will pay for it thus you have an automatic pressure on prices as it is used by a smaller pool of people than if everyone in the country was paying for it independent of income and because the people buying health insurance feel they need to have insurance their price elasticity of demand will become inelastic the price may change a lot but the amount of demand wo n't change much so if i 'm a private insurance company i will charge as much as i can because i know that people will be willing to pay more for   the same healthcare cost    the european system will simply be a cheaper option than the us because it concentrates a larger pool of payers and is not aimed at profits additionally if there were quality issues in the healthcare provided this would have been seen long ago if you compare the amount of money spent in the us and europe on healthcare in europe the cost of healthcare is theoretically only the government spending in the us it is both and private spending     tell me what you think

there is a fourth option pay those taxes depending on the amounts it might be the easiest way if you make in interest and pay 6 $ in taxes on it and be done that might not be worth any other effort if the expected taxable amount is significant moving most of it to index funds or other simply switching existing investments to instead of pay out in would be the best approach again some smaller amounts in savings or accounts are probably not worth any effort transferring the money to the us does n’t save you taxes as any interest would still be taxable you have a risk to lose on the conversion back and forth and a potential to gain the exchange rate could go either way so if you are sure you go back it ’s not a good idea to move the money

your question seems to be making assumptions around investing that investing is only about stock market and bonds or similar things i would suggest that you should look much broader than that in terms of your investments investment types your should consider and include some or all of the following for your investments depending on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc i love ’s explanation of diversification into other asset classes producing a lower risk portfolio excellent all the above need to be considered in this spread of risk depending as i said earlier on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc stock market investment i ’ll focus most of the rest of my post on the stock markets as that is where my main experience lies but the comments are applicable to a greater or lesser extent to other types of investing we then come to how engaged you want to be with your investments two general management styles are passive investment management versus active investment management says   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs    across asset classes and just leave them the difficulty with this idea is that profitability is very dependent upon when the stocks are purchased and when they are sold this is why active investing should be considered as a viable alternative to passive investment   i do n’t have access to a very long time frame of stock market data but i do have 30 or so years of ftse data so let ’s say that we invest £ 100,000 for 10 years by buying an etf in the index i know this is n't de risking across a number of asset classes by purchasing a number of different but the logic still applies if you will bear with me passive investing i have chosen my example dates of best 10 years and worst 10 years as specific dates that demonstrate my point that active investing will usually out perform passive investing from a passive investing point of view here is a graph of the ftse with two purchase dates chosen for maximum effect to show the best and worst return you could receive note this ignores brokerage and other fees in these time frames of data i have    these are contrived dates to illustrate the point on how ineffective passive investing can be depending if there is a bear bull market and where you buy in the cycle   one obviously would n’t buy all their stocks in one tranche but i ’m just trying to illustrate the point active investing let ’s consider now active investing i use the following rules for selling and this is obviously a very simple technical trading system and i would not recommend using it to trade with as it is overly simplistic and there are some flaws and inefficiencies in it so in my simulation   these beat the passive stock market profit for their respective dates summary passive stock market investing is dependent upon the entry and exit prices on the dates the transactions are made and will trade regardless of market cycles active stock market trading or investing engages with the market using a set of criteria which can change over time but allows one ’s investments to be in or out of the market at any point in time my time frames were arbitrary but with the logic applied which is a very simple technical trading methodology i would suggest that any 10 year time frame active investing would beat passive investing

the debt is absolutely real china loans money to us via buying the us treasury bonds the bond is essentially a promise to pay back the money with interest just like a loan as you point out the us can print money if this were to happen then the usd that the owner of a treasury bond receives when the bond matures are worth less that than the usd used to purchase the bonds there are lots of reasons why the us does n't want to print lots of money so the purchaser of the bond is probably confident it wo n't happen if for some reason they think it is possible then they will want to cover that risk by only purchasing bonds that have a higher interest rate the higher interest offsets the risk of the usd being worth less of course there are lots more details e.g. the bonds themselves are bought and sold before maturity but this is the basic idea

no   if the share price drops to $ 0 it 's likely that the company is in bankruptcy usually debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first and you 're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off more often than not equity holders probably wo n't get much to give an example corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization in the us these are called chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy respectively canada and the united kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations although in the uk reorganization is often referred to as administration many countries have similar procedures in place i 'll use the us as an example because it 's what i 'm most familiar with in chapter 7 bankruptcy the company is liquidated to pay its debts investopedia 's article about bankruptcy states during chapter 7 bankruptcy investors are considered especially low on the ladder usually the stock of a company undergoing chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless and investors lose the money they invested if you hold a bond you might receive a fraction of its face value what you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page in chapter 11 bankruptcy the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization the investopedia article quotes the sec to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens during chapter 11 bankruptcy bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments and stockholders stop receiving dividends if you are a bondholder you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds if you are a stockholder the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company the new shares may be fewer in number and worth less the reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive if anything from the company the exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that 's worked out local laws court agreements etc for example in the case of general motor 's bankruptcy stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company

sadly most jurisdictions do n't think this way when they assign property taxes   you have x acres our standard for this county is $ y per acre so you owe $ property taxes     and if you tax by dwelling size and features you are saying a poor person can not live in a nice house   lets say joe millionaire buys a fancy $ 2 m house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings   sure joe millionaire can afford the high taxes of say $ 20k year   but what if jim who makes only $ 35k year spends 10 years and about $ 100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds purchases on sale or on craigslist etc   he rents a and   a gun and builds himself a fancy pool it really nice and the county comes in and says well jim that 's a $ 2 m house you owe us $ 20k year in taxes for it   jim ca n't afford it and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes   screw you and your efforts poor person   and before you say he can just sell it for $ 2 m well what if he made it unique to his tastes and no one wants to buy it   or the market is bad right now     and yes this has happened to someone i know though the house was valued at $ 500 k he still could n't afford the taxes   and since it was not yet fully finished he had to sell it for only about $ 100k after working on it for several years   so yes as long as you want to make sure poor people can not live in nice places property tax is the way to go

the best way to invest in college for your kid is to buy an investment property and rent it out you might think i am really crazy to ask you to you to buy a real estate property when everyone is running from real estate   go where others are running away from it look where others are not looking find out the need for a decent rental property in your city or county and start following the real estate market to understand the real activities including the rental market i would say follow it for 6 months before jumping in with any investment   and manage your property with good tenants until your kid is ready to go to college by the time your kid is ready for college the property would have been paid off by the rents and you can sell the property to send your kid to college

you add the wash sale loss to your cost basis for the other transaction so you would have two entries in your schedule d reporting 1 listing the $ 2000 loss as a wash 2 the cost basis for your second transaction is thus $ = $ 3000 so when it was sold for $ 2000 you now have a reportable loss of $ 1000 for more information see here

while this seems overall a macroeconomics question and not really personal finance let me give it a shot the question of why corporations form in a free or efficient market is why ronald coase received the 1991 nobel prize in economics for his work developing the theory of the firm corporations organize when there are transaction costs in the free market corporations form when it is in fact more efficient for a corporation to exist than a number of small producers contracting with one another   to the extent that corporations add efficiency to a total market they are not zero sum at all the net production is increased over what would exist in a market of sole proprietors who would have costs such as researching the trust levels in counterparts regulatory compliance etc that they can not bear to engage in the same level of transactions

there are still ways that the default values on the w4 can lead you to get a refund or owe the irs if there was a big delta in your paychecks it can lead to problems if you make and get 26 paychecks that means each check had a gross of 10,000 your company will withhold the same amount from each check but if you earned a big bonus then the smaller regular paychecks may not have been withholding enough   when bonus checks are involved the payroll office has to treat them as irregular pay to be able to make it work out some companies do n't do this so you may under or over pay during the year if you changed companies during the year this can lead to under or over payment the lower paying company would not know about the higher rate of pay at the other company so at one you would under pay and the other you would over pay there are also social security issues with more than one employer

let 's suppose your friend gave your $ 100 and you invested all of it plus your own money $ 500 into one stock therefore the total investment becomes $ 100 + $ 500 = $ 600 after few months when you want to sell the stock or give back the money to your friend check the percentage of profit loss so let 's assume you get 10 return on total investment of $ 600   now you have two choices either you exit the stock entirely or you just sell his portion if you want to exit sell everything and go home with $ 600 + 10 of 600 = $ 660 out of $ 660 give you friend his initial capital + 10 of initial capital therefore your friend will get $ 100 + 10 of $ 100 = $ 110 if you choose the later to sell his portion then you 'll need to work everything opposite take his initial capital and add 10 of initial capital to it which is $ 100 + 10 of $ 100 = $ 110 sell the stocks that would be worth equivalent to that money and that 's it similarly you can apply the same logic if you broke his $ 100 into parts do the maths

this is the bird 's eye view of how shorting works when you place an order to sell a stock short your broker attempts to grab the desired number of shares from any accounts of its other customers and makes them available for you to sell if no other customers own shares of this stock then generally you are out of luck it is more complicated like that in practice but this is just an overview     your odds are better if the particular stock has a large float i.e. a large number of shares that are actually available for trading and its short ratio is low which means relatively few shares    are currently being sold short also a large brokerage may be more likely to have access to the shares than a small niche market broker    the example you 've given 's list is a $ 600 m small cap with a comparatively low float and though i have n't been able to glean the short ratio it appears that a lot of investors are bearish on this stock and probably already had the same idea to short it   there is really no way to find out if a specific broker has shares in inventory available for shorting short of forgive the pun checking directly with the broker

if you can still work i think a very good course of action would be to invest the majority of the money in low cost index funds for many years the reason is that you are young and have plenty of time to build a sizable retirement fund how you go about this course of action depends on your comfort level with managing your money taxes retirement accounts etc at a minimum open an investment account at any of the major firms schwab fidelity for example they will provide you with a free financial advisor ideally s he would recommend something like open a retirement account and invest as much as you can tax free or tax deferred since you already received the money tax free a roth ira seems like a no brainer pick some low fee equity funds like an s&p 500 index fund for a large chunk of the money avoid individual stocks if you are n't comfortable with them alternatively get a recommendation for a fixed fee financial planner that can help you plan for your future above all do n't spend beyond your means you have an opportunity to fund a very nice future for yourself especially if you are able to work while you are still so young

sigh so i guess you do n't understand why they would care about no risk   if the sub company fails but had no debt then the parent company only loses whatever money they invested in the sub company   if the sub company fails and had debt     the parent company is responsible for those debts and must pay them if in the agreement with the bank the parent company is responsible     the parent company is not responsible for those debts if in the agreement with the banks they did not agree to be collateral if the sub company went bankrupt not likely that a bank would agree to this though they might even try to sue the parent company so they could get some reimbursement

i think it 's great idea   many large brokerages give customers access to a pretty sizable list of zero commission zero load funds   in this list of funds will certainly be an s&p 500 index   so you can open your account for free deposit your $ 1,000 for free and invest it in an s&p index for no cost   you 'll pay a very negligible amount in annual expense fees and you 'll owe taxes on your gain if you have to use the money   i do n't follow the school of thought that all investment money should be in retirement account jail but i think if you have your spending under control you have your other finances in order and just want to place money somewhere you 're on the right track with this idea

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

in a perfect world scenario you would get a car 2 5 years old that has very little mileage   one of the long standing archaic rules of the car world is that age trumps mileage   this was a good rule when any idiot could roll back an odometer chances are now that if you rolled your odometer back the car was serviced somewhere had inspection or whatever and it is on a report   if seller was found to do this they could face jail time and obviously now their car is almost worthless why do i mention this   because you can take a look at 2011 cars   those with 20 k miles go for just a little more than those with 100 k miles    as an owner you will start incurring heavy maintenance costs around 100 k on most newer cars by buying cars with lower mileage keeping them for a year or two and reselling them before they get up in miles you can stay in that magic area where you can drive a pretty good car for $ 200 300 a month   note that this takes work on both the buying and selling side and you often need cash to get these cars dealers are good about siphoning really good used cars to employees friends    this is a great strategy for keeping costs down and car value up but obviously a lot of people try to do this and it takes work and you have to be willing to settle sometimes on a car that is fine but not exactly what you want as for leasing this really gets into three main components if you are going to do everything at a dealership and you want something new or you might as well lease   at least then you can shop around for apples to apples   the problem with buying a new used car from the dealers in perpetuity is n't the buying process   it is the fact that they will screw you on the trade in   a car that books for 20 k may trade in for   even if the dealer says they are giving you 20 k then they make you pay list price for the car    i have many many times negotiated a price of a car and then wife brought in our car separately and i can count on zero fingers how many times that the dealership honored both sides of the negotiations   not only did they not honor them but most refused to talk with us after they found out    with a lease you do n't have to worry about losing this money in the negotiations   you might pay a little extra or not since you can shop around but after the lease you wash your hands of the car    the one caveat to this is the high end market   when you are talking your acura mercedes lexus it is probably better to buy and trade in every couple years   you lose too much equity by leasing where it wo n't cover the trade in gap and cost of your money being elsewhere   i have a friend that does this and gets a slightly better car every 2 3 years with same monthly payment    another factor to consider is the price of a car   if your car will be worth over $ 15 k at time of sale you are going to have a hard time selling it by owner   when amounts get this high people often need financing   yes they can get personal financing but most people are too lazy to do this   so the number of used car buyers on let 's say craigslist are way way fewer as you start getting over $ 10 12 k and i have found $ 15 k to be kind of that magic amount    the pro buy used side is easy   aim for those cars around $ 12 18 k that are out there and many still under warranty   these owners will have issues finding cash buyers   they will drop prices somewhere between book price and dealer trade in   in lucky cases where they need cash maybe below dealer trade in   and remember these sellers are n't dealing with 100s let alone 10 buyers   you drive the car for 3 4 years   maybe it is $ 7 10k.   but now you will get much much closer to book price because there will be far more buyers in this range

gt she is n't asking for society to bear her burdens she 's asking for society to pay her a reasonable wage for her labor   asking society to implement a policy that will ultimately serve to harm more people   gt so you read the article but then chose to ignore all the arguments showing that this would not in fact ruin the economy    skimming through the article i only saw one sentence that equated to no it would n't for the record i would be   in favor of a scaled negative income tax   gt tell me when drug companies hike the prices of essential medicine do you also argue that it would ruin our economy or cause a lot more suffering or do you just shrug and go they 're charging what the market will bear   it would depend on the situation and why they were doing it but generally speaking i fucking hate the way that our drug industry is set up for a whole host of reasons i think it definitely harms more people than it helps   gt why is that for folks like you it 's always fine if companies raise prices but if employees want a higher wage it 's an outrage   because you have created a group in your head that you are against then you lump anyone that does n't agree with you on other issues into that group without actually having a conversation to find out if they really do believe what you assume they believe you know how conservatives will sometimes go stupid liberals do n't assume you 're above making that same kind of generalization about other people i understand why both sides do it because it 's entertaining to watch stupid people from the other side get interviewed and fail on issues that you agree with

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

one way you can accomplish this is on a cruise ship   most cruise ships have casinos and most will allow you to sign out chips at the casino cage   you can then exchange the chips for cash    the chips that were signed for are resolved as room charges   those room charges can be charged to a cc   those signed for chips are rolled into the total room charges and are thus not treated as a cash advance    the cost of the cruise not with standing you could earn money in that form   step off the boat deposit cash in the bank and send a check to the cc company all that being said it is an cheap and safe way to get cash while you are traveling in that method

bonds might not be simple but in general there are only a few variables that need to be understood bid coupon interest rate maturity and yield   bond tables clearly lay those out and if you 're talking about government bonds a lot of things like do n't apply although default is still a concern this might be overly simplistic but i view etf 's primarily as an easy way to bring somewhat esoteric instruments like grain futures into the easily available markets of nasdaq and the nyse that they got enhanced with leveraged funds and the such is interesting but perhaps not the original intent of the instrument   complicating your situation a bit more is the fee that gets tacked onto the etf even vanguard government bond funds hang out north of 0.1 that 's not huge but it 's not particularly appealing either considering that unlike rounding up live cattle futures it 's not that much work to buy us government bonds so the expense might not seem worth it to someone who 's comfortable purchasing the securities directly   i 'd be interested to see someone else 's view on this but in general i 'd say that if you know what you want and know how to buy it the government bond etf becomes a lot less relevant as the liquidity offered including the actual ease of transacting seem to to be the biggest factors in favor from investopedia 's description the bond etf is an exciting new addition to the bond market offering    an excellent alternative to self directed investors who looking for    ease of trading and increased price transparency want to practice    indexing or active bond trading however bond etfs are suitable for    particular strategies if for instance you are looking to create a    specific income stream bond etfs may not be for you be sure to    compare your alternatives before investing

this is a well worn path and not a bad idea   there are quite a few pitfalls but there are a lot of resources to learn for other people 's mistakes having a plan and doing your research should help you avoid most of them   here is some general advice to help get you started on the right foot   know the market you are investing in   the city should have more than one major employer the population should be rising and hopefully there are other positive economic indicators   check the city 's and state 's chamber of commerce for useful information   you do not want to be stuck holding a bunch of upside down property in detroit    accurately calculate expenses   set aside money for repairs   budget 5 of the rent or 100 a month for repairs if no repairs happen that money goes into the repair fund for the future   set aside money for capital expenditures if the roof has a 10 years of life left in 10 years you better be ready to replace it same with any major appliances your area should have a baseline vacancy rate 5 8 in my area that says out of a year your property will be vacant for around 6 of the year or 21 days for turnover you should build that cushion into the budget as well setting aside a portion of the rent to cover that lean period some property management will offer eviction insurance which is basically them enforcing that savings   financing maybe difficult a lot of banks like to see 25 down payments on investments you will also face higher interest rates for investment properties banks generally also like to see enough money to cover 6 months worth of expenses in your account for all property   some banks will not give financing for investment property to someone without 1 2 years of landlord experience all in all finding money will be hard when you gets started and your terms may be less than ideal   hopefully make around 3 5k a year in profit   if that includes loan pay down and is not just cash flow you are probably in the right ballpark   i can find $ dollars cash flow a month on single family home in my area once loan pay down is included your numbers are close   it sounds like you have a good attitude and a good plan   a book that i really enjoyed and i think may be useful is start small profit big in real estate by jay   i think of it as required reading for do it yourself real estate investors good luck and happy investing

split transactions are to anybody interested in accurately tracking their spending if i go to the big box pharmacy down the road to pick up a prescription and then also grab a loaf of bread and a of milk while there then i 'd want to enter the transaction into my software as i desire entering precise data into the software so that i can rely on the reports it produces often i do n't need an exact amount and estimated category totals would have been fine e.g. to inform budgeting or compare to a prior period however in other cases the expenses i 'm tracking must be tracked accurately because i 'd be using the total to claim an income tax deduction or credit   consider how internet access might be commingled on the same bill with the home 's cable tv service   one is a reasonable business expense and deduction for the work at home web developer whereas the other is a personal non deductible expense were split transaction capability not available the somewhat unattractive alternatives are ignore the category difference and say categorize the entire transaction as the larger or more important category   but this deliberately introduces error in the tracked data rendering it useless for cases where the category totals need to be accurate or split the transaction manually this does n't introduce error into the tracked data but suffers another problem it makes a lot of work first one would need to manually enter two or more top level transactions instead of the single one with sub amounts   perhaps not that much more work than if a split were entered worse is when it comes time to reconcile   now there are two or more transactions in the register but the credit card statement has only one   reconciling would require manually adding up those transactions from the register just to confirm the amount on the statement is correct   major pain i 'd place split transaction capability near the top of the list of must have features for any finance management software

i am just an undergrad but i will try to answer as best i can   as mentioned in the other thread you posted you should study for and take the cfa level one exam in december this will give you some perspective as opposed to simply reading some articles online which talk about the day to day duties and earning potential which i assume is where your real interest comes from it 's easy to be interested when you love a subject it 's not hard to be interested when your big paycheck on friday depends on it it 's very hard to be interested when your first paycheck is two years away   yes an mba is marketable yes they have higher earning potential than a school counselor in a it really depends on you the degree does not make the career and i know a few mbas with sad careers   i would do the cfa first and learn as much as you can about the industry including meeting with people in various roles and asking as many questions as you can before committing to anything especially a costly mba you are 26 you have time not a lot of time since i believe there is a definite preference for young malleable recruits but some time consider it one big research project

i would recommend using growth value income bond based asset allocation because your goal is to find asset classes that have different performance trends when 1 is up the other is down and vice versa     if you chose domestic us stocks and diversified between med cap and large cap stocks they would not exactly mirror each other but they would roughly rise and fall at the same time preventing you from taking full advantage of diversification increasing risk and lowering returns

several options are available she may ask the us bank to issue a debit card visa most probably to her account and mail this card to russia i think this can be done without much problems though sending anything by mail may be unreliable after this she just withdraws the money from local atm some withdrawal fee may apply which may be rather big if the sum of money is big in big banks bank citibank russia etc are atms that allow you to withdraw dollars and it is better to use one of them to avoid unfavorable exchange rate she may ask the us bank to transfer the money to her russian account i assume the currency on the us bank account is us dollars she needs an us dollar account in any russian bank this is no problem at all   she should find out from that bank the transfer parameters for transfering us dollars to her account this should include among other info a bank correspondent and a swift code or may be two swift codes after this she should contact her us bank and find out how can she request the money to be transferred to her russian bank providing these transfer parameters i can think of two problems that may be here first the bank may refuse to transfer money without her herself coming to the bank to confirm her identity how do they know that a person writing or calling them is she indeed however i guess there should be some workaround for this second with current us sanctions against russia the bank may just refuse the transfer or will have do some additional investigations however i have heard that bank transfers from us to private persons to russia are not blocked probably it is good to find this out in advance in addition the us bank will most probably charge some standard fee for foreign transfer after this she should wait for a couple of days maybe up to week for the money to appear on russian account i have done this once some four years ago and had no problems though at that time i was in the us so i just came to the bank myself the bank employee to whom i talked obviously was unsure whether the transfer parameters were enough obviously this was a very unusual situation for her but she took the information from me and i guess just passed it on to someone more knowledgable the fee was something about $ 40 another option that i might think of is her us bank issuing and mailing her a check for the whole sum and she trying to cash it here in russia this is possible but very few banks do cash checks here citibank russia is among those that do the bank will also charge a fee and it will be comparable to transfer fee plus mailing anything is not quite reliable here she would also have to consider whether she need to pay russian taxes on this sum if the sum is big and passes through a bank i guess russian tax police may find this out through and question her if it is withdrawn from a visa card i think it will not be noticed but even in this case she might be required to file a tax herself
