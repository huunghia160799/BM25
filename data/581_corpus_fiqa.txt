i 'd like to modify the loss idea that 's been mentioned in the other two answers   i do n't think a retail location needs to be losing money to be a candidate for sale   even if a retail location is not operating at a loss there may be incentive to sell it off to free up cash for a better performing line of business many large companies have multiple lines of business   i imagine makes money a few ways including refining the gas and other petroleum products selling those petroleum products selling gas wholesale to outlets or other large buyers licensing their brand to outlets selling gas and convenience items direct to consumers through its own corporate owned retail outlets etc if a company with multiple lines of business sees a better return on investment in certain businesses it may make sense to sell off assets in an under performing business in order to free up the capital tied up by that business and invest the freed up capital in another business likely to perform better so even money making assets are sometimes undesirable relative to other better performing assets another case in which it makes sense to sell an asset that is profitable is when the market is over valuing it   sell it dear and buy it back cheap later

two different takes on an answer the net loss concept you mentioned and a core business concept if a store is actually a net loss and anybody is willing to buy it it may well make sense to sell it   depending on your capital value invested and how much it would take you to make it profitable it may be a sound business decision to sell the asset   the buyer of the asset is of course expecting for some reason to make it not a net loss for them perhaps they have other stores in the vicinity and can then share staff or stock somehow the core business is a concept   investors seem to go in cycles like can like well diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector but then they also like so called pure play companies where you are clear on what you are owning   to try an example which is likely not the case here lets say that in 5 of its stores had migrated away from a gas station model to a one stop gas and repairs model therefore they had to have service parts and trained staff at those locations   these things are expensive and could be seen as not their area of expertise selling gas so as an investor if i want to own gas stations i do n't want to own a full service garage so perhaps i invest in somebody else once they sell off their non core assets they free up capital to do what they know best it is at least one possible explanation

maybe the location is n't yet but will soon become a new loss   for example older soon out of warranty equipment new tax laws in the locality soon to take affect or even just declining sales over the past periods of measurement perhaps labor disputes or other locality issues make running the store difficult    there is the possibility that the land the location occupies is worth more sold to the new big box retailer than it will be in the next 10 years of operation in some cases companies want to have a ton of cash on hand or would sell assets to pay off debt

ok this gives us something to start on i am owner of a company that our best selling product is government designed    your position is that there is no profit incentive if government invests in a company i know from first hand experience that is not true if government were funding your whole company and you as an owner had no skin in the game then yes that would be true however that is not what government does i have experience from receiving government grants for our own innovation as well as receiving the right to sell a government designed product    our company competes with a number of other companies that do the same this investment in our work has given our company a great boost which has lead to other ideas and inventions as well as growth and expansion the end user has gotten the benefit of that too as the government is n't really good at mass production and sales but we are however if the government had n't made this investment we would still be doing what we are doing it would have just taken us a little longer to get here    you other position is that they only listen to special interests who would like it if the project is as expensive as possible there is some truth to that and there are definitely projects where we have seen that but that is more the exception than the rule what usually happens is eventually these companies piss off an end user who receives the product which is the result of these bloated contracts when it gets bad enough people run to their representatives and there is a major investigation i know of a couple of people who have spent time in the federal including the owner of another small business in the city where my company is a lot of times these companies are banned or are moved to the fringe where they go into a death spiral    competition is the of capitalism and our company has grown and succeeded because we pick up business all the time from larger companies who bloat and laziness has caused them to be noncompetitive

you are correct that the price fixed when the contract is made is set and maybe there are a few institutions that do n't actually bother to track the future after they initiate the contract   but most parties likely track the contracts fairly carefully for a number of reasons   the big deal is that while the price the contract is set and if you did a perfect hedge maybe the value of the contract and the thing you are hedging is then fixed the value of that futures contract by itself changes and this is important the biggest reason is as jb mentions above most futures contracts settle up on a daily basis as the price of the underlying changes   this happens to limit the losses when for large price changes and one party owes a bunch of money on a futures contract and for that reason or a different one goes bankrupt   if the other party is using the contract to hedge a sale or asset maybe this risk is minimal but maybe that expected sale does n't happen or maybe the party is using futures for speculation   there is no way to know built into the contract if a party is really hedging or not so people naturally want to limit this default risk there are many other reasons to track profit and loss as well there are likely even more reasons as well that i 'm missing but hopefully that gives you an idea

@littleadv has said most of what i 'd say if they had not gotten here first i 'd add this much it 's important to understand what debt collectors can and can not do because a lot of them will use intimidation and any other technique you can think of to get away with as much as you will let them i 'd start with this pdf file from the ftc and then start googling for info on your state 's regulations also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default   the fee 's the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable or it might be something you already agreed to in you little recourse but to pay them do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10   on a debt of your size paid off over several years that might amount to more than the $ 4 k they are adding   otoh you can pretty much expect them to try both tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid    another source of assistance may be the department of education ombudsman if you need help with a defaulted student loan contact the department of education 's ombudsman at or visit its website at but first you must take steps to resolve your loan problem on your own there is a checklist of required steps on the website or the ombudsman will not assist you

with a short position you make your money profit when you buy the stocks back to close the position at a lower price than what you bought them at as short selling is classed as speculation and not investing and you at no time own any actual assets you can not donate any short to charity if you did want to avoid paying tax on the profits you could donate the proceeds of the profits after closing the position and thus get a tax deduction equal to the profits you made but that raises a new and more important question why are you trading in the first place if you are afraid to make profits in case you have to pay tax on those profits

i am in complete agreement with you   the place i have found with the sort of charts you are looking for is    to compare the percentage increase of several stocks over a period of 2 market open days or more which is quite useful to follow the changes in various stocks etc an example   here the tickers are aa to otc and $ gold $ silver for the spot gold silver price that is n't really a ticker   it is set to show the last 6 market days one the 6 in   you can change it in the url above or change it on the site for the stocks you want up to 25 in one chart but it gets really hard to tell them apart   by moving the slider just left of the at the bottom right corner of the chart you can look at 2 days or more   for a specific time period in days highlight the and type any number of market open days you want 21 days = about one month etc   by setting a time period in days and moving the entire slider you can see how your stocks did in the last bull bear run as an example the site has a full how to for this and the other types of charts they offer the only problem is that many otc stocks are not charted save the comparison charts you use regularly in a folder in your browser bookmarks     i see the entire needed link is n't in blue but you need it all

i 'm not sure i understand your question but i 'll try to answer what i think you 're asking i think you 're asking this a us bank receives a wire transfer from a chinese bank how does the    us bank ensure there 's any money in fact arriving before crediting the    destination account well the way wire transfers work is that the us bank would debit the account with that us bank so the us bank in fact transfers the money between two internal accounts debit to the chinese bank 's account with that us bank and credit the destination customer account if the chinese bank does n't have an account with the destination us bank a third party intermediary is used that both banks have accounts with such third party will charge an additional fee hence sometimes the wire transfer fees are slightly higher than you initially know when sending the money the third party would debit from the transfer amount regular iban ach transfers work through regulatory channels that ensure integrity and essentially use a regulatory bank as that third party but because they 're done in batches and not on line they 're much cheaper and the accounting is for the whole batch and not each transfer separately but batch processing means it will take a day or two of processing while wire transfer takes hours at most

when we say stock market we are usually thinking of the publicly traded stocks such as the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq shares of individual products do not go on these exchanges only large corporations   you wo n't see a stock ticker symbol for the force or for the iphone plus   the reason for this is that when investors buy a stock they are looking for something that will grow in value theoretically forever individual products usually have a limited lifespan your movie will hopefully generate revenue when it comes out but after a while sales will slow down after people have seen it if someone bought a share of stock in a movie on the stock market they have to realize that eventually the movie will stop making money and their share of stock wo n't be worth anything anymore instead people invest in companies that have the potential to make new products such as disney or apple   so if you were seeing the ticker symbol of your movie going across the screen on cnbc sorry that 's not going to happen   however you could theoretically sell shares to individual investors for a percentage of the profit you figure out how much money you need to create the movie and estimate how much profit you think the movie will earn then you find an investor or group of investors that is willing to give you the money you need in exchange for a percentage of the profit unlike a stock market investor these investors wo n't be looking for the long term growth potential of the resale value of the stock but simply a share of the profit

possibly not relevant to the original asker but in the uk another advantage of using a credit card is that when making a purchase over £ 100 and paying by credit card you get additional protection on the purchase which you would n't get when paying by debit card e.g. if you buy something costing £ 100 and the company goes bust before it 's delivered you can claim the money back from the credit card company   whereas if you paid by debit card you would potentially lose out this protection is a legal requirement under section 75 of the consumer credit act 1974

no but the damage to the quality reputation of the brand can be very real amazon absolutely has an inventory problem where they   are turning a blind eye to counterfeit goods this problem is exacerbated by their commingling of inventory where they can get the same item from multiple suppliers where some of the goods are genuine and some are counterfeits and they are mixed together if the good being bought is listed on amazon as genuine but the consumer is shipped a low quality fake then it is reasonable for the customer to assume the quality of the good is low as they assume amazon would not ship a counterfeit   in 's case they are alleging that very thing happened amazon was allegedly selling counterfeits that they got from other sources than directly from via the authorized seller option and then were shipping those to customers causing damage to the brand though if that were true i would expect to sue amazon and not simply them

the short answer is yes electrical vehicles make logistical sense the batteries are n't quite where they should be to really push the market but the are high enough and the batteries themselves can be recycled    there are two major advantages that electric has over oil the first is that electricity is abundant and can come from many sources this means that a car can be running on power from coal wind solar hydro electric or any other source of electricity this also means that the cost per mile driven is generally lower than the cost of a gas driven car    another big advantage is the national security it offers if electric were to really enter the consumer market in a big way the dependency on countries in the middle east and africa would be lessened it would also ease some of the competition between nations like china and the united states over natural resources    of course their are problems with electric cars as well and they are n't even close to replacing gas for use in heavy machinery

when an ipo happens the buyers pay some price let 's say $ 20 per share and the seller the company receives a different price $   who paid the commission well the commission caused a spread between buyer and seller   it does n't matter who technically pays the commission because it costs both parties   in an ipo the company technically pays the commission but they use buyers money to do it and the buyer must pay more than he she would if there was no commission the same thing happens when you buy a home   technically the seller pays both realtors commissions but it came from money the buyer gave the seller and the commissions pushed up the price so did n't the buyer pay the commission   they both did the second paragraph suggests that if the investment bankers act as a simple broker buying public securities instead of newly issued shares for their clients then the commissions will be much lower   obviously   i wonder if this is really the right interpretation though as no broker charges 4 to a large client for this service   i would need more context to be sure that 's what 's meant the is that ipos generate a lot of money for the investment bankers who act as intermediaries   if you are participating in the transaction that money is in some way coming out of your pocket even if it does n't show up as a brokerage fee on your statement

you ’ve really got three or four questions going here and it ’s clear that a gap in understanding one component of how bonds work pricing is having a ripple effect across the other facets of your question the reality is that everybody ’s answers so far touch on various pieces of your general question but maybe i can help by integrating so let ’s start by nailing down what your actual questions are   1 why do mortgage rates tend to increase when the published treasury bond rate increases i ’m going to come back to this because it requires a lot of building blocks 2 what ’s the math behind a bond yield increasing price falling   this gets complicated fast especially when you start talking about selling the bond in the middle of its time period many people that trade in bonds use financial calculators excel or pre calculated tables to simplify or even just approximate the value of a bond but here ’s a simple example that shows the math   let ’s say we ’ve got a bond that is issued by dell for $ 10,000 the company will pay it back in 5 years and it is offering an 8 rate interest payments will only be paid annually remember that the amount dell has promised to pay in interest is fixed for the life of the bond and is called the rate we can think about the way the payouts will be paid in the following table    as i ’m sure you know the value of a bond its yield comes from two sources the interest payments and the return of the principal but if you as an investor paid $ 14,000 for this bond you would usually be wrong you need to those amounts to take into account the time value of this is why when you are dealing in bonds it is important to know the coupon what is dell paying each period but it is also important to know your own personal discount rates this will vary from person to person and institution to institution but it is what actually sets the price you would buy this bond for   there are three general cases for the discount rate or the market rate first where the market rate = = the coupon rate this is known as par in bond parlance second where the market rate < the coupon rate this is known as premium in bond parlance third where the market rate > coupon rate this is known as a bond   but before we get into those in too much depth how does discounting work the idea behind discounting is that you need to account for the idea that a dollar today is not worth the same as a dollar tomorrow it ’s usually worth tomorrow you discount a lump sum like the return of the principal differently than you do a series of equal cash flows like the stream of $ 800 interest payments the formula for discounting a lump sum is   present value = future value of periods the formula for discounting a stream of equal payments is   present payment i = interest rate and n = number of periods cite investopedia so let ’s look at how this would look in pricing the pretend dell bond as a par bond first we discount the return of the $ 10,000 principal as 10,000 1 that equals $   next we discount the 5 equal payments of $ 800 as 800 i just plugged and but you can do that yourself that equals $ you may get slightly different numbers with rounding   so you add the two together and it says that you would be willing to pay $ + $ = $ 10,000 surprise when the bond is a par bond you ’re basically being compensated for the time value of money with the interest payments you purchase the bond at the face which is the principal that will be returned at the end   if you worked through the math for a 6 discount rate on an 8 coupon bond you would see that it ’s premium because you would pay more than the principal that is returned to obtain the bond vs 10,000 similarly if you work through the math for a 10 discount rate on an 8 coupon bond it ’s a bond because you will pay less than the principal that is returned for the bond vs 10,000   it ’s easy to see how an investor could hold our imaginary dell bond for one year collect the first interest payment and then sell the bond on to another investor the mechanics of the calculations are the same except that one less interest payment is available and the principal will be returned one year sooner so in both formulae   still with me now that we ’re on the same page about how a bond is priced we can talk about yield to maturity which is at the heart of your main question   bond yields like the ones you can access on cnbc or or wherever you may be looking are actually taking the reverse approach to this in these cases the prices are in that the sellers have listed the bonds for sale and specified the price since the coupon values are fixed already by whatever organization issued the bond the rate of return can be imputed from those values   to do that you just do a bit of algebra and swap present value and future value in our two equations   let ’s say that dell has gone private had an awesome year and figured out how to make robot unicorns that do wonderful things for all mankind you decide that now would be a great time to sell your bond after holding it for one year and collecting that $ 800 interest payment you think you ’d like to sell it for $ 10,500 since the principal return is fixed + 10,000 the number of periods is fixed 4 and the interest payments are fixed $ 800 but you ’ve changed the price something else has to adjust and that is the discount rate it ’s kind of tricky to actually use those equations to solve for this by hand you end up with two equations one unknown and set them equal so the easiest way to solve for this rate is actually in excel using the function = pmt pv fv nper = 4 pmt = 800 and hint to make sure that you catch the minus sign in front of the present value buyer pays now for the positive return of 10,000 in the future   that shows as the effective discount rate or rate of return for the investor that is the same thing as the yield to maturity it specifies the return that a bond investor would see if he or she purchased the bond today and held it to maturity   3 what factors in terms of supply and demand drive changes in the bond market i hope it ’s clear now how the tradeoff works between yields going up when prices go down and vice versa it happens because the coupon rate the number of periods and the return of principal for a bond are fixed so when someone sells a bond in the middle of its term the only things that can change are the price and corresponding yield discount rate   other commenters including you have touched on some of the reasons why the prices go up and down generally speaking it ’s because of the basics of supply and demand higher level of bonds for sale to be purchased by same level of demand will mean prices go down but it ’s not just because interest rates are going up and it has a lot more to do with the expectations for 1 risk 2 return and 3 future inflation sometimes it is action by the fed as joe taxpayer has pointed out if they sell a lot of bonds then the basics of higher supply for a set level of demand imply that the prices should go down prices going down on a bond imply that yields will go up i really hope that ’s clear by now this is a common monetary lever that the government uses to remove from the system in that they receive payments from an investor up front when the investor buys the bond from the fed and then the fed gradually return that cash back into the system over time   sometimes it is due to uncertainty about the future if investors at large believe that inflation is coming then bonds become a less attractive investment as the dollars received for future payments will be less valuable this could lead to a sell off in the bond markets because investors want to cash out their bonds and transfer that capital to something that will preserve their value under inflation here again an increase in supply of bonds for sale will lead to decreased prices and higher yields   at the end of the day it is really hard to predict exactly which direction bond markets will be moving and more importantly why if you figure it out move to new york or chicago or london and work as a trader in the bond markets you ’ll make a killing and if you ’d like i will be glad to drive your cars for you   4 how does the availability of money supply for banks drive changes in other lending rates   when any investment organization forms it builds its portfolio to try to deliver a set return at the lowest risk possible as a corollary to that it tries to deliver the maximum return possible for a given level of risk   when we ’re talking about a bank dumbcoder ’s answer is dead on banks have various options to choose from and a 10-year t bond is broadly seen as one of the least risky investments thus it is a benchmark for other investments   5 so now why do mortgage rates tend to increase when the published treasury bond yield rate increases the traditional residential 30-year mortgage is very similar to a bond investment there is a long term investment horizon with fixed cash payments over the term of the note but the principal is returned incrementally during the life of the loan   so since mortgages are more than the 10-year treasury bond they will carry a certain premium that is tied to how much more risky an individual is as a borrower than the us government   and here it is no one actually directly changes the interest rate on 10-year treasuries not even the fed the fed sets a price constraint that it will sell bonds at during its periodic auctions buyers bid for those and the resulting prices imply the yield rate if the yield rate for current 10-year bonds increases then banks take it as a sign that everyone in the investment community sees some sign of increased risk in the future this might be from inflation this might be from uncertain economic performance but whatever it is they operate with some rule of thumb that their 30-year mortgage rate for excellent credit borrowers will be the 10-year plus 1.5 or something and they publish their rates

as i stated in my comment on 's answer the only way you benefit by putting your money in an ira or other tax deferred vehicle is if you expect to have a lower tax rate when you withdraw than when you put the money in   if you look at 's numbers and remember to pay taxes when you withdraw the money in 30 years you will see that both situations paying taxes now or 30 years from now give you the exact same dollar amount if the tax rates are the same at both points in time   so if you put money in an ira you 're betting on the fact that the government will not substantially raise interest rates by then and/or that you will be in a lower tax bracket to me the only valid reasons to invest in an ira or 401 k are the following however you should also consider the major downside that the money is locked away and at best inconvenient to access when you need it   at worst you have to pay taxes and penalties if you ever withdraw that money   if you are a financially responsible person i think you 're generally better off keeping your money outside of an ira or 401 k with the exception of making sure to get all of your employer 's matching contributions

what you want is a position transfer likely by    this is a transfer from one ira to another without having to liquidate positions to do so   in effect the brokerage firm is just transferring records from your existing ira to your new ira   you will need to watch out to make sure your new ira account can hold your positions for this to work   for example some brokerages allow you to hold fractional shares but others do n't   the fractional share amounts would be sold automatically prior to transfer   another example might be different fund families could be allowed between different brokerages the general process is open your new ira account initiate the from your new account your old ira account brokerage sends the positions over and after a week or so your new ira brokerage notifies you that everything is transferred i 've switched iras a couple times via this mechanism and never been charged a fee but i 've always stuck with the larger brokerages like fidelity td ameritrade and interactive brokers

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

inflation is basically this   over time prices go up i will now address the 3 points you have listed suppose over a period of 10 years prices have doubled   now suppose 10 years ago i earned $ 100 and bought a nice pair of shoes   now today because prices have doubled i would have to earn $ 200 in order to afford the same pair of shoes   thus if i want to compare my earnings this year to 10 years ago i will need to adjust for the price of goods going up   that is i could say that my $ 100 earnings 10 years ago is the same as having earned $ 200 today or alternatively i could say that my earnings of $ 200 today is equivalent to having earned $ 100 10 years ago this is a difficult question because a car is a depreciating asset which means the real value of the car will go down in value over time let us suppose that inflation does n't exist and the car you bought for $ 100 today will depreciate to $ 90 after 1 year a 10 depreciation but because inflation does exist and all prices will be 0.5 higher in 1 years time we can calculate the true selling price of the car 1 in year as follows 0.5 of $ 90 = 0.005 90 = $ 0.45 therefore the car will be $ 90 + $ 0.45 = $ in 1 years time if inflation is low then the repayments do not get much easier to pay back over time because wages have not risen by as much   similarly the value of your underlying asset will not increase in value by as much however as compensation the interest rates on loans are usually lower when inflation is lower therefore generally it is better to get a loan in times of high inflation rather than low inflation however it really depends on how the much the interest rates are relative to the inflation rate

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

there needs to be more numbers with your choices without those any answer is purely speculation assuming that india is much like the us you are almost always better to go with a company leased car   that is if you are not responsible for the lease if your employment ends with the company here in the us companies typically reimburse so tax free their employees for about 50 cents per mile or about 31 cents per   this barely covers the gas and insurance and falls way short when one includes and maintenance   so it is better to have the company to pick up all those costs       borrowing money on a car is just plain dumb no matter what the interest rate   so i would stick with choice number 1 or 3 depending on the arrangement for the company leased car the next question becomes how much you should spend for a car   i would say enough to keep you happy and safe but not much more than that until you are wealthy

no it 's not a good idea you started by saying you 'd like to invest but then mentioned something that 's not an investment it 's a speculation both forex and cfds are not really investments they are a zero sum game where over time it 's a pool of your money the other trader 's money and the broker redistributed over time   if you truly wish to invest you 'll read up on the process understand your own long term goals and put aside x% say 5 15 of your monthly income you should look into investments that are long term and will fund your retirement 30 40 years hence

the problem is n't capitalism per se but rather a failure of regulation yes purely that means the problem is capitalism but i hate saying it that way because it comes across as suggesting that capitalism in and of itself is bad   for capitalism to work you must have regulation when regulation fails and allows in this case companies to become nations unto themselves and potentially abusive then yes that becomes problematic

what he does nt mention is that when american was great was largely the 50 's and 60 's a period characterized by stellar tax rates   in 1944 fdr set the top marginal tax rate at 94 for anything over today 's of $ 400k salary and a corporate tax rate of 70    cutting corporate tax rates when ppl do n't have any more to spend will only create bigger pay packets what is happening today is that the extra profits are being used for buying back stock not reinvesting bc nobody can buy more that benefits only the top 0.01 of the population   but the real worry is that these inflated stock prices are a mirage inside the companies are not doing any better soon its all going to collapse like a balloon made worse by the lowering of tax rates so much for maga

as far as i know there is no direct equivalent an ira is subject to many rules   not only are there early withdrawal penalties but the ability to deduct contributions to an ira phases out with one 's income level   qualified withdrawals from an ira wo n't have penalties but they will be taxed as income   contributions to a roth ira can be made post tax and the resulting gains will be tax free but they can not be withdrawn early another tax deductable investment is a 529 plan   these can be withdrawn from at any time but there is a penalty if the money is not used for educational purposes a 401 k or similar employer sponsored fund is made with pre tax dollars unless it is designated as a roth 401k.   these plans also require money to be withdrawn specifically for retirement with a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   qualifying withdrawals from a regular retirement plan are taxed as income those from a roth plan are not as with an ira money can be made harder to get at by investing in all of the types of funds you can invest in using an ira through the same brokers under a different type of account but the contribution will be made with post tax non deductable dollars and the gains will be taxed

i compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends hard to find however managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard   after discussing with many in the real estate world i counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 8 on real estate after taxes   this does not include anything else like dilip mentions maintenance insurance etc   for those who want to avoid that route you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or reit funds like dilip mentions   however they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this in terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed   we wo n't our need for real estate but we wo n't our need for food or tangible goods either   you can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund finally one of your best investments is your career field software   do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start up it 's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set or create a site which generates passive revenue again not that hard   one software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation think of a smart phone application that you build once yet continues to generate revenue   this was right before the crash and after it everyone talked about another lost decade   while it does require extra work initially like all things software related you 'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications meaning your first one may be the most difficult all it takes in this case is one really good idea

this is a tough question because it is something very specific to your situation and finances i personally started at a young age 17 with us$ 1,000 in scottrade i tried the stock market games at first but in retrospect they did nothing for me and turned out to be a waste of time i really started when i actually opened my brokerage account so step one would be to choose your discount broker for example scottrade ameritrade my current broker e trade charles schwab etc do n't worry about researching them too much as they all offer what you need to start out you can always switch later but this can be a little of a hassle for me once i opened my brokerage account i became that much more motivated to find a stock to invest in so the next step and the most important is research there are many good resources on the internet there can also be some pretty bad ones here 's a few i found useful investopedia they offer many useful easy to understand explanations and definitions i found myself visiting this site a lot cnbc that was my choice for business news i found them to be the most while being very informative fox business seems to be more political and just annoying to watch bloomberg news was just boring on cnbc jim cramer was a pretty useful resource his show mad money is entertaining and really does teach you to think like an investor i want to note though i do n't recommend buying the stocks he recommends specially the next day after he talks about them instead really pay attention to the reasons he gives for his recommendation it will teach you to think more like an investor and give you examples of what you should be looking for when you do research you can also use many online news organizations like marketwatch the motley fool yahoo finance has some pretty good resources and read editorial opinions articles with a grain of salt but again in each editorial they explain why they think the way they think

the whole premise of the article is that there is not enough aggregate demand aka spending in the economy a theory rooted in a keynesian understanding of economics   when will we finally realize that this is all completely wrong   we 've tried this for decades and it 's only lead to unsustainable public debt   americans need to save right now not spend     keynes war on capital war on capital   gt;no distinction is made between and productive spending in the keynesian framework   and this is the all decisive point keynesians have cause and effect backward here as in so many other places   spending for them demand which production and it is assumed implicitly the creation of capital   this is of course and naively backward for it is production that yields income that permits spending

is she entitled to more of the equity because she made more no   equity should be determined by how much each paid   but she is entitled to more of the equity if she paid more   and that may be what she is saying   that she contributed more to the household 's finances than you did    if you always paid the mortgage out of the joint account you could presumably go back and look at the account to find out how much each of you contributed to it   that would give you a reasonable split for the remainder of the equity after your initial investment   if you both put your entire paychecks into the joint account every time then it will be the same as the ratio of what you each made   that would also make sense for splitting up whatever remains in that account    while you 're doing that you may want to ask for more for your original $ 65,000   by my calculation if your mortgage was 3.5 that $ 65,000 saved the household more than $ 12,000 in interest that became equity instead   so you could reasonably bump your return on the initial investment up to $ while making the concession on the rest of the equity    this is just a suggestion for a framework for splitting the equity   if you can agree on a split it will almost certainly be easier than going to a mediator or court

what might make more sense is to capture your losses   sell out the funds you have move into something else that is different enough that the irs wo n't consider it a wash sale and you can then use those losses to offset gains you can even carry them forward    you would still be in the market just having made a sort of sideways move   a month or two later once you are clear of wash sale rules you could shift back to your original choices   this answer presumes you are in the us or somewhere that lets you use losses to offset gains

you got out in time great but how did you know when to get back in the internet is littered with threads by people who got out in advance or during then did n't get back in in time because the did n't feel real some people are still sitting out just hoping against hope the market crashes but it probably wo n't to those 2009 levels   i recommend looking at trinity wiki results as a place to start getting a sense of portfolio longevity when totally out of the market the reality is that all cash which is basically a zero duration bond is a dangerous position as is all stocks a balanced portfolio gives you diversification the only free lunch in investing   better to not try and time your way in and out of the market but rather glide within a range benjamin graham recommends no more less than if you want to skip the research headaches stick with a total bond or intermediate term bond fund or google around for lazy portfolios   the real key is not to let emotions drive your decisions it always feels different this time until it is n't much better to set a target portfolio of stocks bonds rule of thumb imagine you might lose half the stock portion in a downturn then ride it out that way you do n't have to worry about being at one extreme or the other

of course the situation for each student will vary widely so you 'll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation now that the disclaimer is out of the way the best choice would be to use the unsubsidized stafford loan to finance graduate school if you need to resort to loans the major benefits to the unsubsidized stafford are the following you 'll be forced to consider other loan types due to the unsubsidized stafford loan 's established limits on how much you can borrow per year and in aggregate the borrowing limits are also adjustable down by your institution the plus loan is a fallback loan program designed to be your last resort the program was created as a way for parents to borrow money for their college attending children when all other forms of financing have been exhausted as a result you have the following major disadvantages to using the plus loan you do have the bonus of being able to borrow up to 100 of your educational costs without any limits per year or in aggregate the major benefit of keeping your loans in the direct loan program is predictability many private student loans are variable interest rate loans which can result in higher payments during the course of the loan private loans are also not eligible for government loan forgiveness programs such as for working in a non profit for 10 years

a loan is most generally a liability a part of the balance sheet   expenses income are part of the income statement   income is the net of revenues after expenses the interest is an expense on the income statement but the loan itself does not reside there unless if it is defaulted and forgiven   then it would become a revenue or contra expense depending on the methodology the original purpose of the income statement is to show the net inflows of short term operational accruals which would exclude new borrowing and repaid loans the cash flow statement will better show each cash event such as borrowing debt repaying debt or paying off a bill to show how a loan may have funded a bill which in theory it directly did not because an entity be it a person or business is like a single tank of water with multiple pipes filling and multiple pipes extracting so it is impossible to know which exact inflow funded which exact outflow unless if there is only one inflow per period and one outflow per the same period that being said with a cash flow statement the new loan will show a cash inflow when booked under the financing portion and paying a bill will show a cash outflow when booked under the operating portion   with only those two transactions booked and an empty balance sheet beforehand it could be determined that a new loan funded a bill payment

i would say that the three most important skills are note that some costs are hidden so for example a mutual fund investing in other countries than where you live in may mean the investment target country charges a certain percentage of dividends going to the mutual fund the mutual fund company does n't usually want to tell you this there may be clever financial instruments derivatives that can be used to avoid this but they are not without their problems if you diversify into equities at low cost you will have a very wealthy future i would recommend you to compare two options and pick from these options the cheaper one if your time has a high value and you wish to take this value into account i would say it is almost always far better option to choose an index fund whatever you do do n't pay for active management it is a mathematical truth that before costs actively managed investments will yield the same return than indexed investments however the costs are higher in active management so you will have less total return do n't believe that good historical return would imply good future return however if for some reason you see an index fund that continuously loses to the index more than by the amount of stated costs beware

no it is not normal the normal process is that the money is transferred to your account with out issue   this would be an exception   that does not mean that there is anything to worry about   it could be that the transaction met some criteria that triggered closer examination or it could be that yours is just one randomly being reviewed   and it could just be that your husbands partner misunderstood or lied    step 1 would be contact the bank and find out what is going on and if there is any action you need to take   assuming that the bank confirms the status and the amount is significant enough i would probably give my lawyer a heads up of what is going on   if homeland security is involved there is a reasonable chance that you will need that representation anyway so getting the lawyer involved early might save you a headache in the end   the lawyer is probably the only person that will be able to get any answers for your anyway from comments my husband is a consultant that works for another company as a    consultant that company received a contract from a government south    of the us free trade approved that government first wired the    overall government contract to the company account in that originating    country then the funds were wired to the us counterpart company    then then consultants gets paid it sounds like the contract is not your normal business to business international contract   so normal goes out the window there   when you start getting foreign governments involved things get lets use the word interesting   if the contract involves anything with military or restricted technology applications even if they are not directly military then hsa wants to make sure that no one is circumventing export restrictions   with out knowing more specifics it is difficult to guess whether or not there is anything for your husband to worry about   the bottom line for him is that he does not have his money so he should keep that in mind when delivering services to the prime contractor

you could buy options i do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn there are weekly monthly quarterly yearly and even longer duration options called leaps you have decided how long of a time frame you also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently today is hypothetically a thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on friday the next day of strike and the call option is priced at cents and you buy it this means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0 the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying say the spy moved 55 cents up from 100 to minus the strike = 5 cents so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents you lost almost 91 of your money rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less the leverage is on a 10x scale typically that is why timing is so important anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future but if you know when you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market another thing you can do is figure out how much msft contributes to the spx movement in terms of points what does a 1 move in msft spx if you can calculate that and you think you know where msft is going you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft you could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor but be careful like said look into an etf that has microsoft the nasdaq has a which microsoft is in called the triple q. the ticker is qqq qqq ™ formerly known as qqq or the 100 index tracking stock ® is an exchange traded fund based on the index ® best of luck and always understand what you are buying before you buy it

probably a bad assumption but i 'm assuming your in the united states keep in mind that the check number is printed in 2 places on the front of each check first in the upper right corner and also along the bottom edge on of the check since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed and you ca n't modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks so modifying the check numbers will not work your choices are basically to    the check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check the numbers are only for your convenience so processing checks with duplicate numbers wo n't matter   the check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements the only time the check number might be important is if you had to stop payment on a particular check or otherwise inquire about a particular check but this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks and start using the checks with duplicate numbers the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time you did n't mention how many checks you have with duplicate numbers or how frequently you actually write checks so that may play a part in your decision in my case 100 checks will last me literally years so it would n't be a problem for me

people are downvoting you but the reality is that a cushion is n't a bad idea   not a perpetual thing but until the op gets set up with a job place to live etc   they know the job is going to work out etc they might want to have some cash as they are likely not going to forgo eating etc that said i would treat it as money to be used in place of a credit card with the high rates etc    again i am not saying spend the money i am being realistic that it takes money to secure an apt and unless you can borrow cheaper than 6 elsewhere i know i could probably get unsecured money cheaper than that where i live but i do n't know the ops situation   i would n't invest it given the situation personally   if you have a great job it wo n't matter you will build up past 1200 soon and can then start to invest a portion of that cash   if you do n't then you should n't be risking debt money especially if your level of sophistication in the market has you here asking the question   that 6 savings is tax free as well so you need to gross it up based on your tax situation   also make note of any currency conversions that would need to happen so depending on what you want to invest in currency risk could be a real concern as well   one other reason i think getting down at least a portion of the debt could be good is simplification   ca n't spend money you do n't view yourself as having   some people might be more disciplined to reign in spending when they see a lower number in their account   i 'm personally not one of those people but again i would likely kill the debt off now just to have one less thing on my mind but only as soon as i am stable know where i am going to live have enough to eat and relatively sure that will continue in the future

i got $ the first problem with this is that it is backwards   the npv net present value of three future payments of $ 997 has to be less than the nominal value   the nominal value is simple   $    first step convert the 8 annual return from the stock market to a monthly return   everyone else assumed that the 8 is a monthly return but that is clearly absurd   the correct way to do this would be to solve for m in   but we often approximate this by dividing 8 by 12 which would be   either way you divide each payment by the number of months of compounding    sum those up using m equal to about i left the calculated value in memory and used that rather than the rounded value and you get about $ which is smaller than $    obviously $ is much larger than $ and you should not do this   if the three payments were $ instead then it would about break even    note that this neglects risk   in a three month period the stock market is as likely to fall short of an annualized 8 return as to beat it   this would make more sense if your alternative was to pay off some of your mortgage immediately and take the payments or pay a lump sum now and increase future mortgage payments   then your return would be safer    someone noted in a comment that we would normally base the npv on the interest rate of the payments   that 's for calculating the npv to the one making the loan   here we want to calculate the npv for the borrower   so the question is what the borrower would do with the money if making payments and not the lump sum    the question assumes that the borrower would invest in the stock market which is a risky option and not normally advisable   i suggest a mortgage based alternative   if the borrower is going to stuff the money under the mattress until needed then the answer is simple   the nominal value of $ is also the npv as mattresses do n't pay interest   similarly many banks do n't pay interest on checking these days   so for someone facing a real decision like this i 'd almost always recommend paying the lump sum and getting it over with   even if the payments are same as cash with no premium charged

this does n't really make sense as the small cap indices have a similar rate of growth as the s&amp;p 500 the global scale has some relevance but exports are included in gdp as well so it 's not the full story   a better answer as is noted in comments lower down is that the s&amp;p does not grow at 6 it returns 6 per year the dividend yield of the s&amp;p is a bit over 2 dividends are not growth they are simply income they may also grow themselves but rarely by 6 per year in real terms additional income that 's not paid out in dividends probably amounts to another 1 2 growth is the final 1 3 which makes it roughly match gdp

there are certain standards that modern checks need to meet these are n't required by law but banks today generally insist on them if you are able to meet these standards and print your own checks at home you are allowed to do so one way this is commonly done is with purchased check and check printing software office supply stores sell check that fit into standard computer printers this check paper includes the necessary security features of checks and using the check printing software you can print your personal information including your name address your bank 's name and address and your account numbers the account numbers on the bottom of the checks are called the micr code which stands for magnetic ink character recognition normally these numbers were printed with special magnetic ink which was used in automated check reading machines checks that you purchase from your bank still use magnetic ink however modern check readers are optical and do n't require magnetic ink so you should be able to print checks with your printer using standard ink toner and not have a problem without purpose specific check printing software you could still buy blank check paper from the store and with a little trial and error you could print using excel   the biggest challenge with doing this would be printing the micr code you would probably need to install an micr font on your computer and play around with the size and location until you get it where you want it   doing a little googling i see that there are some check printing excel templates out there but i have n't tried any of these and it is unclear to me whether they actually print the micr or whether they assume that you have blank checks with the micr account number and check numbers already printed without purchasing blank check paper you wo n't have any of the security features such as protection anti background etc   as you mentioned if you are depositing checks via mobile phone app as some banks now allow none of these security features are doing any good   the problem however is that you are not writing checks for yourself you are writing checks to other people and you have no way of knowing whether or not their banks are going to give them trouble with your checks   there is enough check fraud out there that lots of bank tellers are very cautious   i recommend sticking with check paper that has the security features because if nothing else it will make your check look more like a real check

i think we would be good with paying around $ 1200 monthly mortgage fees with all other property fees included like tax etc you probably ca n't get a $ 250k house for $ 1,200 a month including taxes and insurance   even at a 4 rate and 20 down your mortgage payment alone will be $ and with taxes and insurance on top of that you 're going to be over $ 1,200   you might get a lower rate but even a drop to 3 only lowers the payment $ getting a cheaper house which also reduces taxes and insurance is the best option financially what to do with the $ 15k that i have if you did n't have a mortgage i 'd say to keep 3 6 months of living expenses in an emergency fund so i would n't deplete that just to get a mortgage you 're either going to be   since 1 the mortgage payment would be tight and 2 you are n't able to save for a down payment my recommendation is for you to rent until you can make a 20 down payment and have monthly payment that is 25 of your take home pay or less   which means either your income goes up which you indicate is a possibility or you look for less house   ideally that would be on a 15-year note since you build equity and reduce interest much more quickly than a 3-year note but you can get the same effect by making extra principal payments also very few people stay in their house for 30 years 5 years is generally considered the cutoff point between renting and buying   since you 're looking at a 10-year horizon it makes sense to buy a house once you can afford it

whoa whoa whoa let 's not twist that data and make an assertion that it does n't support yes medical inflation has outpaced the cpi for ages but when you spending into medicare us single payer and private insurers medicare is able to better contain my hypothesis likely due to its ability to leverage its scale and keep costs low while private insurers are fragmented against strong provider networks    but wait you 're thinking should n't market forces keep insurance outlays low it 's econ 101 right theoretically they should but this ignores the industrial structure of healthcare providers and assumes perfect competition that does n't exist typically providers doctors groups hospitals etc are highly localized and able to exercise significant market power in a relative to several insurance plans who are competing to contract that provider in network for example when aetna and go up against hypothetically to negotiate payment rates has the ability to obtain high reimbursement rates because the three insurers have to have that provider in network to remain competitive ironically the less competition on the insurer side in that market the better reimbursement rates would be observed since the sole insurer would capture a large fraction of patients in the geographic area served and could use that volume to negotiate better rates   finally there 's the overhead issue medicare has lower overhead expenses than private insurers do again my guess greater economies of scale and lower advertising and marketing costs coupled with no profit motive even health themselves agree resources pdf that medicare has lower overhead costs and that includes some questionable addition of what the authors claim are hidden medicare expenses   i 'm inclined to believe that a single payer is probably more efficient and cheaper than a fragmented private insurance market that said i also find some sympathy to the argument that maintaining a robust private insurance market may spur innovation on payor innovation e.g. increased participation in wellness programs for or increasing the likelihood that patients be more sensitive to costs and benefits when seeking care after all countries like germany and switzerland are able to maintain a private insurance market while ensuring nearly universal coverage either way though arguing that health inflation alone makes single payer systems unsustainable is n't a strong argument since private insurers are currently doing worse on cost

this answer should be taken as a counterpoint to s 's excellent answer i have comprehensive insurance on my vehicle that is if i crashed it and wrote it off my insurance would cover the replacement costs now if this happened i would be able to deal with the replacement costs myself even without insurance it would not significantly impact my lifestyle and would not put my emergency funds at risk though obviously i would n't be happy about this as the insurance company is planning on making money off of me it 's clearly not in my financial best interests to carry this insurance statistically speaking it 's a cost to me and a profit for the insurance company so why do i do it because i find it easy to pay a small amount of money every month for the peace of mind that if i crash my car i will not have to cover the large expense i am perhaps irrationally risk averse i 'm happier paying a small amount of money in exchange for a guarantee that i will not have to pay a large amount of money i mitigate a potentially larger cost albeit with low likelihood for the certainty of a smaller cost my monthly insurance payments this is separate from the mandatory public liability public damage insurance that i am required to cover that insurance fits into 's definition of a devastating event

i 'm not sure what point you think i was making it looks like you think i 'm supporting the idea that qe causes inflation which it does n't at least not when it is being used as it has been what it does seem to have done is depress interest rates and create a speculative market that does n't match up with economic reality it has also created a ridiculous profit loop for investment banks selling bonds to the fed   you ca n't talk about qe without mentioning that banks are now incentivized to hold onto reserves because they can collect interest so the banks screwed up were heavily subsidized under the pretense of it being best for the taxpayer and were then rewarded for sitting on all of that money    if i support any viewpoint it is this the government agreed to give the banks a thin veneer of solvency by granting them enormous sums in a short period obviously if that much currency went straight into the market it would be a disaster so it put a mechanism in place to reward them for holding onto it all qe did was massively increase the debt burden of the government which will be passed on to taxpayers in the form of taxes fines fewer benefits worsening infrastructure and more restrictions qe may have not caused inflation but it certainly did n't help the vast majority of americans who will simply see their standard of living decline at a quicker pace i 'm sure this will get blamed on immigrants or something instead of the reality that our government is rewarding banks for not lending to individuals why would they an individual might not pay them back but the government always will by simply extracting more out of those very individuals

it really depends on the terms of your loan for example some loans have a pre payment penalty you will just have to ask your lender to know for sure that said in almost all cases you can save considerable interest by making extra payments towards the principal be careful though some lenders require you to specifically mark the payment to be applied to the loan principal and if you do n't designate it as such they will just apply it as an early payment for future months and not reduce your balance until that future payment is due which does n't help at all another option to reduce your total interest costs though more common for larger loans like mortgages is to split the payment into multiple parts and pay more than once a month instead of a single payment each month this only works if they calculate interest daily and would be useless if they do it monthly they key is knowing the terms of your loan despite it not being in their best interest pun intended most lenders will work with you on a strategy to help you minimize the interest cost in the name of customer service

make a list of all your expenses i use an excel spreadsheet but you can do it on the back of a napkin if you prefer list fixed expenses like rent loan payments insurance etc i include giving to church and charity as fixed expenses but of course that 's up to you list regular but not fixed expenses like food heat and electricity gas etc come up with reasonable average or typical values for these keep records for at least a few months so you 're not just guessing though remember that some will vary with the season presumably you spend a lot more on heat in the winter than in the summer etc you should budget to put something into savings and retirement if you 're young and just starting out it 's easy to decide to postpone retirement savings but the sooner you start the more the money will add up even if you ca n't put away a lot try to put away something and if you budget for it you should just get used to not having this money to play with then total all this up and compare to your income if the total is more than your income you have a problem you need to find a way to cut some expenses i wo n't go any further with that thought that 's another subject hopefully you have some money left over after paying all the regular expenses that 's what you have to play with for entertainment and other non essentials make a schedule for paying your bills i get paid twice a month and so i pay most of my bills when i get a paycheck i have some bills that i allocate to the first check of the month and some to the second for others whatever bills came in since my last check i pay with the current check i have it arranged so each check is big enough to pay all the bills that come from that check if you ca n't do that if you 'll have a surplus from one check and a shortage from the next then be sure to put money aside from the surplus check to cover the bills you 'll pay at the next pay period   always pay your bills before you spend money on entertainment always have a plan to pay your bills do n't say oh i 'll come up with the money somehow if you have debt student loans car loans etc have a plan to pay it off one of the most common traps people fall into is saying i really need to get out of debt and i 'm going to start paying off my debt next month because this month i really want to buy this way cool toy they put off getting out of debt until they have away huge amounts of money on interest or worse they keep accumulating new debt until they ca n't even pay the interest

barclays bank and deutsche bank have an agreement as part of the global atm alliance that allows you to make withdrawals at deutsche bank atms at no charge the usefulness of this arrangement to you depends on how you use your money and would entail opening an account at barclays or royal bank of scotland edit david it looks like you will need some kind of residency to open a barclays account but you may be able to qualify with the proper supporting documentation see this website uk banking services and uk bank accounts from barclays wealth international

you owe only $ to pay off your loan now possibly less    from what you say about your loan tell me if i got this right 30 year loan $ original loan amount 9 annual interest rate $ monthly payment you have made payments payment number is not due until late 2019 possibly early 2020 if i have correctly figured out what you have done you have been making monthly payments early by pulling out payment coupons before they are due and sending them in with payment   you are about 4 years ahead on your payments    if i have this correct if you called the bank and asked what is my payoff amount if i want to pay this loan off tomorrow they would answer something like $   when you pay a loan off early you do n't just owe the sum of the coupons still remaining   in your case you owe at least $ 16,000 less indeed if there is some way to convert your 4 years of pre payments into an early payment you would owe even less than $   i do n't know banking law well enough to know if that is possible    you should stop pulling coupons out of your book and paying them early   any payments you make between now and when your next payment is actually due late 2019 sometime you should tell the bank you want applied as an early payment   this will bring your total owed amount down much faster than pulling coupons out of your book and making payments years early    if there is someone in your family who understands banking pretty well maybe they can help you sort this out   i do n't know who to refer you to for more personal help but i really do think you have more than $ 16,000 to gain by changing how you are paying your mortgage    good luck

my response was actually about the stupidity of and the of the public with minimalist government spending   i made no argument that the government need to be lavish   and i agree first class is not necessary in almost all cases but it is easier to be productive in first class   and if you 're competing with the private sector for talent there are certain places that is both counter to productivity and strategic outcomes   you want the best medical doctors working for the and the cdc forcing shitty working conditions on them out of rigid demands is not a useful tactic   and again i agree harassing entry level and working class employees over small issues is n't good for the staff the government or the people they serve   if you want to find chip and food programs quit giving out corporate welfare in the form of military hardware the pentagon does n't even want just for the sake of chest and looking good   and stop insisting that all taxes are spent it 's untrue   but making highly educated powerful government employees live on the cheapest possible benefits and costs of employment is silly and counterproductive it moves you closer to ensuring government dollars are inefficient because no one talented will bother staying

assuming this is a question of u.s. securities laws you did n't explain whether you 're related to the mother and son but i 'll assume you are   if that 's the case this really would n't qualify as a solicited sale   it was n't advertised publicly for sale and there is already i assume a long standing relationship between the parties   in such a case this would be a perfectly legal and normal type of transaction so i ca n't see any reason for concern    that being said you would be wise to contact the state securities regulation agency where you live to ensure you 're on firm ground the law pertaining to the solicited sale of securities normally targets instances where people are trying to do private stock offerings and are seeking investors in which case there are a number of different state and federal agencies and regulations that come into play   the situation you 've described does not fall under these types of scenarios good luck

the u.s. requires money transfer services to be licensed under 31 usc in addition to any applicable laws at the state level   according to multiple sources online including the thread referenced by md tech 's answer okpay either can not or will not get a license so they are out i dug on this a bit more because i thought it was interesting and okpay has other issues with u.s. and other regulators related to its interaction with bitcoins which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem   it seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries by the way so it 's not strictly a problem they face in the u.s.   just for whatever reason the problem is greater here   some interesting summary points with mounting pressure on online money exchanges from us regulators payments processor okpay has announced that it is suspending processing for all bitcoin exchanges including industry leader gox earlier this month the us department of homeland security seized gox 's account with mobile payment processor dwolla on allegations that the account was in violation of us code 18 usc 1960 by operating an money transmitting business just where the bitcoin market falls under us law is unclear because the legality of bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations such as the dwolla case in march the us treasury said any firms dealing in the virtual currency would be considered money services businesses just like any other which means they must hand over transaction information to the government and work to prevent money laundering in the uk it apparently has also had trouble with banking partners quoting a okpay official regarding changing bank providers the uk bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto currencies or not therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers this apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the uk okpay 's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that gbp users check a box verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency a feature that further users i had n't heard of this company prior to your question but having done some research i tend to think that at least the part of this quote about language attributed to a user is true okpay are quite paranoid about aml and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at english so their replies are often hard to understand their support are also slow sic however in my experience they are an honest company i found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company again i know only what i read just now about this company but it looked like there were a few red flags the problems with the us probably not being the most important   this type of service is probably part of the future but i 'm not sure that i 'd send money through it now in its current state or organization and regulation

yea but they might feel and that you pulled a fast one on them and not be as willing to give you good deals in the future    like as a totally non mathematical example they have a car for $ 50k they lower the price to 40k with a financing that will bring total payment to 60k their break even on that car is let 's say 45k the financier cuts them a commission on expected profits of maybe 7k they made an expected 2k on the car but if you pay it all off asap they may lose that commission be 5k in the hole on the sale and pretty upset even more upset if they finance in house    so when you go back to buy another car they 'll say fuck this guy we need to recoup past lost profits do n't go below 4 k above break even    i 'm not really 100 on how financing workings when it comes to cars but from my background in sales this is the bar i would set for a customer that made me take a loss by doing business with them if they tried to come back in the future   this does n't take into account how car dealerships do n't own their inventory finance all of their cars and actually are willing to take a loss on a car just to get it off the lot some times

for big values the loss becomes negligible say you have a 10 chance to get 10 million $ expected value 1 m you sell that chance for which loses you 10k of expected income why would you throw away 10k because in the face of getting almost 1 m the 10k are insignificant 1 m and will make you roughly equally rich also the increase from 1 m to 10 m is less than 10x since 1 m gives you maybe 90 of the freedom that 10 m does depending on how well you can make 10 m work for you most people will just let it rot in the bank another way to look at it is to look at bankruptcy risk say i have 10k in the bank which is nice those 10k can not pay for a new house or 2 cars mine and the one i hit so i have a small risk of significant loss if i buy an insurance i reduce my chance of going bankrupt from maybe 0.001 to 0 for a fairly small price usually you can buy insurance fairly cheap if you raise your deductible to maybe 5k both for the house and the car so that you shoulder the risk you can risk = gaining money and paying an insurance to shoulder the rest for you that way you minimize the cost to remove the risk of bankruptcy it makes sense to shoulder as much risk as you can unless a fixed fee of the insurance makes in before paying others to do it for you so you can optimize your income while removing fatal risks

another way to delay receipt is to delay billing to be safe you will have to wait until the new year to send the bill because if you do it in late december they could be super efficient and send it to you with just a few days turn around they may being trying to spend money before the end of the year long ago there was a year where there were tax cuts starting january 1st   i new of companies who allowed their employees to defer receiving their december paychecks until january for families with two income this made a difference because they moved a month worth of one of their incomes into the cheaper year if they were n't living month to month they could easily absorb the delay of course if you already sent the invoice

keeping a receipt does allow you to verify that the expected amount was charged debited it also can help when you need to return an item   regarding double charging the credit card companies look for that if the same card is used at the same vendor for the same exact amount in a short period of time the credit card company will flag the transaction they assume either a mistake was made or fraud is being attempted the most likely result is that the transaction is denied   a dishonest vendor can write down the card number expiration date and cvv number then after you leave make up a new transaction for any amount they want you of course would n't have a paper receipt for this fraudulent transaction the key is reviewing your transaction history every few days looking for unexpected amounts locations or number of transactions

imho your thinking is spot on   more than likely you are years away from retirement like 22 if you retire somewhat early   until you get close keep it in aggressive growth   contribute as much as you can and you probably end up with 3 million in today 's dollars    okay so what if you were retiring in a year or two from now and you have 3 m and have managed your debt well   you have no loans including no mortgage and an nice emergency fund   how much would you need to live   60 or 70 k year would provide roughly the equivalent of 100 k salary no social security tax no commute and no need to save for retirement and you would not have a mortgage so what you decide to do is move 250 k and move it to bonds so you have enough to live off of for the next 3.5 years or so   that is less than 10 of your nest egg   you have 3.5 years to go through some roller coaster time of the market and you can always cherry pick when to replenish the bond fund having a 50 allocation for bonds is not very wise   the 80 probably good for people who have little or no savings like less than 250k and retired    i think you are a very bright individual and have some really good money sense

i doubt there is anything you can do to convince them you paid outside of just talking to them which it seems you already tried these are the possibilities i can think of for how this happened imho the most likely scenario is 4 if 1 or 3 happened you 'll never see your money again but the other 3 possibilities leave open the option of the error being discovered in the future my suggestion if the copay is small is to pay it again ask for a receipt and ask them to make a note in the system that you claim you already paid and ask them to be on the look out for any discrepancies in that amount this way with a good amount of luck if they find it or discover the error from another customer asking about the credit or an accounting cash surplus they can refund it to you

i 'm in a similar situation but i live in a state that does n't allow to walk away without recourse i would consider a short sale or otherwise abandoning the property if at the end of the day real estate is an investment and you do n't realize gains or losses until you close the position the ra ra crowd that thought that real estate was going to boom forever in 2006 was just as wrong as the bad news bears crowd that thinks that real estate will never recover either   investments rise and fall many people who bought houses in the 1980 's boom recall the crisis were underwater for years until prices started rising in the 's you have n't lost money until you realize that loss

mint.com uses something called ofx open financial exchange to get the information in your bank account if someone accessed your mint account they would not be able to perform any transactions with your bank all they would be able to do is view the same information you do which some of it could be personal < that 's up to you generally the weakest point in security is with the user an attacker is far more likely to get your account information from you then he is from the site your registered with   why you 're the weakest point when you enter your account information your password is never saved exactly how you enter it it 's passed through what is called a one way function these functions are easy to compute one way but given the end result is extremely difficult to compute in reverse so in a database if someone looked up your password they would see it something like this when you log in to an account your password is sent through this function and then the result is checked against what is saved in the database if they match you are granted access the way an attacker would go about getting your password is by entering values into the function and checking the values against yours this is known as a brute force attack for our example it would take someone 5 million years to decry pt using a basic brute force attack i used as my example password it 's 12 characters long this is why most sites urge you to create long passwords with a mix of numbers and symbols this is a very basic explanation of security and both sides have better tools then the one explained but this gives you an idea of how security works for sites like these you 're far more likely to get a virus or a key steal your information i do use mint edit from the mint faq do you store my bank login information on your servers    your bank login credentials are stored securely in a separate database    using multi layered hardware and software encryption we only store the    information needed to save you the trouble of updating or    uploading financial information manually edit 2   from ofx about security open financial exchange ofx is a unified specification for the    electronic exchange of financial data between financial institutions    businesses and consumers via the internet this is how mint is able to communicate with even your small local bank final edit this answers everything   for passwords to mint itself we compute a secure hash of the user 's    chosen password and store only the hash the hash is also salted see      is a one way function    and can not be reversed    it is not possible to ever see or recover    the password itself   when the user tries to login we compute the    hash of the password they are attempting to use and compare it to the    hashed value on record this is a standard technique which every site    should use for banking credentials we generally must use reversible encryption    for which we have special procedures and secure hardware kept in our    secure and guarded   the keys never leave the    hardware device which is built to destroy the key material if the    protection is attacked   this device will only after    it is activated by a of other keys each of which is stored on    a and also encrypted by a password known to only one person    furthermore the device requires a time limited    signed permission token for each the    system which i designed and patented also has facilities for secure    remote auditing of each source david k vp engineering mint.com

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

you said your mother in law lives with you does she pay rent or are you splitting the cost of housing that would also have to figured into the equation   if you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes this would also then be income for her which she would have to account for on her taxes remember there are both state and federal taxes involved regarding expenses like diapers if the mil had the business she could deduct them as a business expense if you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses if your mil was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse to claim the tax credit you must report the name address and taxpayer identification number    either the social security number or the employer identification    number of the care provider on your return if the care provider is a    tax exempt organization you need only report the name and address on    your return you can use form pdf dependent care provider 's    identification and certification to request this information from the    care provider if you do not provide information regarding the care    provider you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show    that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required    information the irs will be looking for an income tax form from your mil that claims the income   getting too cute with the babysitting situation by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go you can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household agi the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit which mil cause more taxes for your mil plus the whole issue with having to pay social security and other taxes on a household employee it might be best to skip the risk of the audit claiming your mil as a dependent might just be easier

congratulations you are in great shape financially at a very young age   great income nice equity in a home and mostly debt free    it seems like you are looking at taking out a loan of 400 k and to do so you will have to put your own home at risk as you do not have the 80 k cash for a down payment   correct   it also looks like after 2.1 k per year without regard to taxes maintenance bad tenants or vacancies   as such this will likely be a negative cash flow situation   i would say you should plan on a cost   are you okay with that   while your income can probably cover this no problem is that your objective to have this property have a negative return for the next 10 15 years or so for me this is a no   way too much risk for a negative cash flow it is hard to talk to the upside as you did not give any profit predictions and i am unsure of the market    why would you risk your great financial situation with a hail mary attempt to make money   slow down you will get there   save for a few years so there is no need to tap your home 's equity to make a down payment   it would really bother me to owe 600 k on a 121 k salary k

one of the of free trade is that there is now a global labor market so companies routinely review their operations and think strategically about where the company is going standard options are because the disincentives that once existed in the past are gone the need for humans to do work tariffs regulation poor infrastructure in the developing world the available supply of labor is greater and demand lower thus wages are falling in real terms think in the simplest terms in an office environment   in 1980 to make you needed a xerox machine that required a technician on site every couple of weeks to make adjustments change toner etc there was probably a local rep you called to schedule break fix now technology has replaced that copy machine with a cheap multi function device that requires no maintenance and any technical support is delivered by a person sitting in a indian call center so to answer your question the incremental money from rising prices goes to a number a places alot of it goes to oil producers and other commodity producers much of it consists of indirect costs that fulfill other mandated services when you buy something buried in that cost are things like health insurance prescription drugs and school taxes

roth is currently not an option unless you can manage to document income at 6 this would be difficult but not impossible my daughter was babysitting at 10 that 's when we started her roth   the 529 is the only option listed that offers the protection of not permitting an 18 year old to blow the money but only if you maintain ownership with the child as beneficiary the downside of the 529 is the limited investment options extra layer of fees and the potential to pay tax if the money is withdrawn without child going to college as you noted since it 's his money already you should not be the owner of the account that would be stealing   the regular account a ugma is his money but you have to act as custodian a minor ca n't trade his own stock account in that account you can easily manage it to take advantage of the kiddie tax structure the first $ 1000 of realized gains go untaxed the next $ 1000 is at his rate 10 above this is taxed at your rate with the chance for long capital gains at a 15 rate   when he actually has income you can deposit the lesser of up to the full income or $ 5500 into a roth this was how we shifted this kind of gift money to my daughter 's roth ira $ 2000 income from sitting permitted her to deposit $ 2000 in funds to the roth the income must be documented but the dollars do n't actually need to be the exact dollars earned this money grows tax free and the deposits may be withdrawn without penalty the gains are tax free if taken after age 59 1/2   please comment if you 'd like me to expand on any piece of this answer

you absolutely should consider expenses why do they matter when the sticker price already includes them   because you can be much more certain about what the expense ratio will be in the future than you can about what the fund performance will be in the future the sticker price mixes generalized economic growth i.e. gains you could have gotten from other funds with gains specific to the fund but the expense ratio is completely fund specific   in other words when looking at the sticker price performance of a fund it 's difficult to determine how that performance will extend into the future   but the expense ratio will definitely carry into the future   it is rare for funds to drastically change their expense ratios but common for funds to change their performance suppose you find a fund that has returned a net of 8 over some time period and has a 1 expense ratio and another fund that has returned a net of 10 but has a 2 expense ratio   so the first fund returned = 8 and the second returned   there are decent odds that over some future time period the first fund will return while the second fund will return   in order for the second fund to be better than the first it has to reliably outperform it by 1 this is harder than it may sound   simply put there is a lot of noise in the fund performance but the expense ratio is all signal of course if you find a fund that will reliably return 20 after expenses of 3 it would probably make sense to choose that over one that returns 10 after expenses of 1   but will reliably return is not the same as has returned over the past n years and the difference between the two phrases becomes greater and greater the smaller n is   when you find a fund that seems to have performed well over some time period you should be cautious there is a good chance that the future holds some regression to the mean and the fund will not continue to be so stellar you may want to take a look at this question which asked about morningstar fund ratings which are essentially a measure of past performance   my answer references a study done by morningstar comparing its own star ratings vs. fund expenses as a predictor of overall results   i 'll repeat here the take home message how often did it pay to heed expense ratios every time how often did it pay to heed the star rating most of the time with a few exceptions how often did the star rating beat expenses as a predictor slightly less than half the time taking into account funds that expired during the time period in other words morningstar 's own study showed that its own star ratings that is past fund performance are not as good at predicting success as simply looking at the expense ratios of the funds

from my experience working in the family business the first step is to make sure you have the authority one of the problems i encountered was that we were given managerial positions were we not empowered to do anything which created many problems which comes to my second point make sure you have clear roles and responsibilities you have to know what you should be doing if you do n't find out asap what you and your other managers are supposed to do and lastly make sure there is accountability and every family member and employees must be treated equally so that if your employees   or you yourself do n't do something you are supposed to do you can be held accountable for your actions you wo n't believe how easy family members get special treatment how family members miss deadlines and nobody cares and how family members are managers when really they are just daddy 's spoiled being there to be peons not to think and facebook more than usual i recommend you read all literature you can get your hands on on dealing with family enterprises and how to deal with common issues good luck i for one am desperately searching for jobs outside the family business because i ca n't take it anymore

in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds

there are penalties for failure to file and penalties for failure to pay tax   the penalties for both are based on the amount of tax due   so you would owe penalties of zero otherwise meaning no penalties at all the irs on late 1040 penalties here are eight important points about penalties for filing or paying late a failure to file penalty may apply if you did not file by the tax filing deadline a failure to pay penalty may apply if you did not pay all of the taxes you owe by the tax filing deadline the failure to file penalty is generally more than the failure to pay penalty you should file your tax return on time each year even if you ’re not able to pay all the taxes you owe by the due date you can reduce additional interest and penalties by paying as much as you can with your tax return you should   explore other payment options such as getting a loan or making an installment agreement to make payments the irs will work with you the penalty for filing late is normally 5 percent of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late that penalty starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date and will not exceed 25 percent of your unpaid taxes if you do not pay your taxes by the tax deadline you normally will face a failure to pay penalty of ½ of 1 percent of your unpaid taxes that penalty applies for each month or part of a month after the due date and starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date if you timely requested an extension of time to file your individual income tax return and paid at least 90 percent of the taxes you owe with your request you may not face a failure to pay penalty however you must pay any remaining balance by the extended due date if both the 5 percent failure to file penalty and the ½ percent failure to pay penalties apply in any month the maximum penalty that you ’ll pay for both is 5 percent if you file your return more than 60 days after the due date or extended due date the minimum penalty is the smaller of $ or 100 percent of the unpaid tax you will not have to pay a late filing or late payment penalty if you can show reasonable cause for not filing or paying on time if the irs owes you a refund april 15 is n't much of a deadline i suppose the real deadline is april 15 three years later that 's when the irs keeps your refund and it becomes property of the treasury   of course there 's little reason to wait that long   do n't let the treasury get all your interest

well reserve requirements concern as the name suggests the reserves e.g. a position on the balance sheet the price of equity only marginally impacts the balance sheet via positions in their own stock not nearly strong enough to be significant the french banks mainly had trouble with liquidity this year we witnessed another collapse of the interbank lending market just as in 2007 watch the libor o n spread and solvency through deterioration of the asset side of the balance sheet    naturally your ability to raise additional equity is influenced by the historic return of your stock but sharp price drops in fact can help you to raise equity simply because your ratios improved p e p b in fact any ratio that includes the price part and the stock became cheaper see ubs singapore gic and gs warren buffet

there could be an impact on facebook because just before the ipo morgan stanley apparently sent information to selected clients that their analysts had just lowered their valuation of the company   there were also reports yesterday that the lowered valuation came about because facebook sent some revised preliminary estimates of second quarter earnings showing lower than expected earnings to morgan stanley and least one talking head said that facebook might also face charges depending on what the cover letters and the e mails back and forth between facebook and morgan stanley said investigations have already been opened   yes a company wants to sell the stock being offered at the ipo at the highest price possible but if it misled the public when offering the stock for sale through its underwriters it can also be liable possibly even criminally liable material added in edit in fact a lawsuit has already been filed   in the us district court in manhattan in this matter whether the sec ever does anything about the matter remains to be seen

index funds may invest either in index components directly or in other instruments like etfs index options futures etc which are highly correlated with the index the specific fund prospectus or description on any decent financial site should contain these details   index funds are not actively managed but that does not mean they are n't managed at all if index changes and the fund includes specific stock they would adjust the fund content of course the downside of it is that selling off large amounts of certain stock on its low point since it 's being excluded presumably because of its decline and buying large amount of different stock on its raising point may have certain costs which would cause the fund lag behind the index usually the difference is not overly large but it exists   investing in the index contents directly involves more transactions which the fund distributes between members so it does n't usually buy individually for each member but manages the portfolio in big chunks which saves costs of course the downside is that it can lag behind the index if it 's volatile also in order to buy specific shares you will have to shell out for a number of whole share prices which for a big index may be a substantial sum and wo n't allow you much flexibility like i want to withdraw half of my investment in s&p 500 since you ca n't usually own 1/10 of a share with index funds the entry price is usually quite low and increments in which you can add or withdraw funds are low too

s p index announcements would have notes on when there are changes to the index   for example in the s p small cap 600 there is a change that takes affect on 19 2013 as for how index funds handle changes to the fund this depends a bit on the nature of the fund as open end mutual funds would be different than exchange traded funds   the open end fund would have to sell and purchase to keep tracking the index which can be interesting to see how well this is handled to keep the transaction costs down while the etfs will just unload the shares in the redemption units of the stock leaving the index while taking in new shares with creation units of the newly added stock to the index

let me start by giving you a of a report that will floor you beat the market investors lag the market by so much that many call the industry a scam    this is the 2015 year end data from a report titled analysis of investor behavior by a firm dalbar it boggles the mind that the disparity could be this bad a mix of stocks and bonds over 30 years should average 8.5 or so take out fees and even 7.5 would be the result i expect the average investor return was less than half of this jack bogle founder of vanguard and considered the father of the index fund was a i got from vanguard decades ago quoted fund managers as saying that indexing is a path to mediocrity fortunately i was a numbers guy read all i could that jack wrote and got most of that less .05 down to .02 over the years to answer the question psychology people are easily scammed as they want to believe they can beat the market or that they 'll somehow find a fund that does it for them i 'm tempted to say ignorance or some other hint at lack of intelligence but that would be unfair to the professionals all of which were scammed by madoff individual funds may not be scams but investors are partly to blame buy high sell low and you get the results above i dare say an investor claiming to use index funds might not fare much better than the 30 year return above if they follow that path buying high selling low edit i am adding this line to be clear my conclusion if any is that the huge disparity can not be attributed to management a 6.7 lag from the s&p return to what the average investor sees likely comes from bad trading to the comments by dave we have a manager that consistently beats the market over any 2 3 year period you have been with him 30 years and are clearly smiling about your relationship and investing decision yet he still has flows in and out people buy at the top when reading how good he is and selling right after a 30 drop even when he actually beat by dropping just 22 by getting in and out he has a set of clients with a 30 year record of 6 returns while you have just over 11 this paragraph speaks to the behavior of the investor not managed vs indexed

the interesting thing about an fsa is that you have access to your total annual election immediately   after electing to put $ 200 per month toward your fsa you can go have a $ 1,500 surgery on january 3rd and pay with your fsa funds   then you can leave the company on february 1st and not owe the company anything i understand that you do n't like that this is the answer but it is   the employer is on the hook for the full elected liability of an fsa plan as of the first day of the plan year   the employer is also paying admin costs that are n't passed to the employees   you contest that this arrangement could leave current employees picking up the bag for employees but there is no employee liability   fsa plans run at a net cost the the employer i 'm sure there are outlier exceptions however i disagree with your premise that   employees generally dislike that fsa plans are use it or lose it and also that there appears to be an obvious alternative that would be preferable the employees that dislike the rules of fsa accounts do n't fully understand the nuances and surely assume that fsa is a synonym for hsa   tons of employers offer their employees fsa plans and they are very well received   you can fill full prescriptions off of a debit card on the third day of the year before you 've even contributed anything hsas are great i have one but they require enrollment in a hdhp and you can only spend the funds currently available in your account   these are two huge limitations addressed by fsa plans   you can have a $ 0 deductible platinum plan with a $ 2,000 out of pocket max and an fsa debit card for virtually tax free healthcare   the caveat being if you do n't use your full fsa election you give it up in fact my biggest gripe with the fsa hsa discussion is that anyone feels the need to claim that hsa funds do n't expire at the end of a plan year as though it 's something other than a personal savings account   an fsa is a spending account or arrangement which is an entirely different animal   it would be like claiming that ira funds do n't expire as though they might somehow

in general over the longer term this is true as a company whom continuously increases earnings year after year will generally continue to increase its share price year after year however many times when a company announces increased earning and profits the share price can actually go down in the short term this can be due to the market for example expecting a 20 increase but the company only announcing a 10 increase so the price can initially go down the market could already have priced in a higher increase in the lead up to the announcement and when the announcement is made it actually the market so the share price can go down instead of up

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

i 'm also a uk ltd company contractor that has the same topic i afraid however that i do n't understand the maths in the original question mortgage interest is flat for the term of the mortgage rather than compounded so ignoring the at the end of the lifespan of the mortgage i get the amount of interest to something like £ 7500 x 0.05 x 25 does this make the decision any easier for you as you point out the total cost of this overpayment from your company account is £ 12,500 using the above figure it would take over 13 years to recoup the £ 5,000 difference at £ 375 interest a year   i used to be of the same opinion that the mortgage should be paid off at all costs first but now i 'm coming round to the american way of thinking £ 12,500 invested in a pension with a 5 yield will easily outstrip the interest saved by making the over payment x 1.05 ^ 25 = £ over 250 better off £ £ + £ 7,500 i now make no mortgage overpayments at all and instead pay all the money into my pension this amongst other things keeps me below the upper earnings tax threshold so i 'm only paying corporation tax for the money i 'm drawing as dividends there 's a massive caveat to this though i 'm 49 i should be able to draw the tax free element of my pension pot in six years time and pay my mortgage off and it 's quite unlikely that the government will be changing pensions policy in that time but drawing 25 tax free has been a feature of pensions for quite some time i can then chose to keep working or retire if my pension is still doing well 9 ish pa at the moment i could chose to not pay my mortgage off at all in the next twenty or so years however all this could change in your position i would do a bit of both make a regular overpayment to pay down your mortgage even a small amount that you 'll barely notice will make quite a difference to the end date of your mortgage £ 100 a month will take years off i did n't start paying properly into my pension until fairly recently and so if you 're not already i 'd also make quite substantial regular payments into one now directly from your company 15 17.5 of your gross drawings leaving it until later will only make it more painful then when you get to retirement age no matter what you 'll have a decent pension pot an actuary i worked with pointed out that if you pay something into a pension when you retire you should have some sort of pot if you pay nothing you are absolutely guaranteed to have nothing and finally if you have n't already fix your mortgage we 're three years into a five year fix the variable rate we were going to be transferred to was we fixed not because of wanting any sense of security but because the fixed rate was with no fee there are much better rates than that about now rates are starting to rise so it 's a good time

there is such a thing as deposit only this will allow the individual 's account to function only for collection of monetary deposits   no one will be able to withdraw only deposit   the account holder may still physically withdraw at their banking institution   think of it as taking your account from a public profile to a private profile   doing this is beneficial for ppl who may have been scammed into a program or product where there account is fraudulently or simply to protect your funds from drafted without your approval or despite your requests for the drafts   when making your account a deposit only account it 's a good idea to open a new account at a different banking institution because some banks will still allow an account that is attached to the deposit only account to be drafted from it    with the new account you can utilize that one for paying day to day bills and just transfer funds from the deposit only account to the new account    a deposit only account is also a good way to build up a nice nest egg for yourself or even a young adult financial

sovereign states borrow money explicitly in a two primary ways a sovereign can not be compelled to repay debt and there is n't a judicial process like bankruptcy to erase debt when sovereigns default they negotiate new terms with creditors and pay back some fraction of the actual debt owed   they can also print money to repay debt which has other nasty consequences but while a state can not be compelled to repay a debt creditors can not be compelled to loan money to the state either any enterprise of sufficient size needs access to capital via loans to meet daily obligations in anticipation of revenue even when times are good defaulting makes borrowing impossible or expensive and is avoided regarding using your military to avoid repaying debt remember what napoleon said an army travels on its stomach military campaigns are expensive no borrowing ability means the soldiers do n't get paid and the food fuel and ammo do n't get delivered smaller countries have other risks as well many nations are essentially forced to use us dollars as a reserve currency or are forced by the market to borrow money in a foreign currency this creates a situation where any risk of non payment results in a deep devaluation of the local currency when your debt is denominated in dollars these shifts can dramatically increase your debt obligations from a local currency point of view you also run the risk that a larger or richer company will park in your harbor and seize assets as payment the us and britain engaged in this several times during the 19th and 20th centuries in general not paying the bills has a effect bad situations get worse and they do so quickly

i have a similar situation five different accounts between me and my wife just as you and b describe i maintain my asset allocation across the combination of all accounts i also maintain a spreadsheet to track the targets deviations from the targets amounts required to get back in balance and overall performance i mostly do n't use mutual funds i have selected for each category 1 or 2 etfs choosing index etfs with low expense ratios and a brokerage with cheap or free trades keeps expenses low my broker offers free etf trades if you buy off their list as long as you are n't short term trading this is great for rebalancing for free 2 or 3 times a year using etfs also solves the minimum balance problem but watch out for commissions if you pay $ 10 to buy $ 500 worth of an etf that 's an immediate 2 loss trade a couple of times a year and that etf has to gain 5 just to break even one issue that comes up is managing cash and avoiding transaction fees say your ira has all the growth stock funds and your roth has the bonds stocks do well and bonds do poorly so you sell off some stocks which creates a bunch of cash in your ira now you want to buy some bonds but you do n't have enough cash in your roth so you buy the bonds in your ira not a problem at first but if you do n't manage it you can end up with small amounts of various funds spread across all of your accounts if you 're not careful you can end up paying two commissions in two different accounts to sell off purchase enough of a category to get back to your targets another problem i had is that only one account 401k is receiving deposits on a regular basis and that 's all going into an s&p 500 index fund this makes it so that my allocation is off by a fair amount every quarter or so too much in large cap equities not enough of everything else my solution to this going forward is to over rebalance a couple of times a year sell enough spy from my other accounts so that i 'm under allocated in large caps by the amount i expect to add to my 401k over the next 3 months so that in six months at my next rebalancing i 'm only 3 months over allocated to large caps plus or minus whatever gains losses there are

not quite while you have considered time efficiency you have forgotten material efficiency can you grow more potatoes in the same piece of land can a single hen lay more eggs can the bees give more wax here is a classic example of exploiting animals and nature it may be hard for people in the first world to imagine exploiting humans the same way as we do animals in the real world however a large section of the worlds human population has lower rights than wild animals in some of the developed parts the reason for this is value system that is our value system an animal in the forest is essentially worthless in our system because it earns no dollars or pays no taxes if it is a rare or magnificent animal like a tiger then it is valued more most people in the world lead primitive lives by our standards and do not deserve the lands that may have fed them for thousand generations so by applying our value system we pay them peanuts as compensation for their land and grab it sadly most of the growth in the world is fueled by such resource land grabs

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

you are confusing entirely unrelated things first the profit distribution issue with bob 's s corp which is in fact tax evasion and will probably trigger a very nasty audit generally if you 're the sole employee of your own s corp and the whole s corp income is from your own personal services as defined by the irs there 's no profit there all the net income from such a s corp is subject to se tax either through payroll or through your k-1 claiming anything else would be lying and irs is notorious for going after people doing that second the issue the reason employers classify employees as contractors is to avoid payroll taxes which the irs gets through bob 's s corp so it does n't care and providing benefits that is bob 's problem not the irs so in the scenario above the irs would n't care whose employee bob is since bob 's s corp would have to pay all the same payroll taxes the is an issue when employees are abused see examples of fedex drivers where they 're classified as contractors and are not getting any benefits spend their own money on the truck and maintenance etc the employees are the ones who sued for but in this case the irs would be interested as well since a huge chunk of payroll taxes was not paid driver 's net is after car maintenance and payments not before as it would be if he was salaried so in your scenario is not as much a concern to bob as his tax evasion scheme claiming earnings from performing personal services as profits from s corp a precedent to look at as i mentioned elsewhere would be the watson v commissioner case

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

one way to do these sorts of calculations is to use the spreadsheet version of irs form 1040 available here   this is provided by a private individual and is not an official irs tool but in practice it is usually accurate enough for these purposes   you may have to spend some time figuring out where to enter the info   however if you enter your self employment income on schedule c this spreadsheet will calculate the self employment tax as well as the income tax   an advantage is that it is the full 1040 so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to enter ordinary w-2 income even capital gains etc of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this but in my experience the excel 1040 is more convenient as most websites and tax prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad hoc way for purposes like tax estimation   you can do whatever works for you but i would recommend taking a look at the excel 1040   it is a surprisingly useful tool

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

looking at some large lotto games out there it seems that the lump sum cash option comes in at anywhere from about 50 to 70 percent of the jackpot amount sum of annual payouts typically over 20 to 30 years i 'm a fan of the phrase money today is better than money tomorrow   there 's no telling how laws will change taxes will change if inflation will skyrocket if you 'll die early if you or a family member will encounter a life changing event etc   by taking the lump sum option you trade a percentage of the winnings for the risk of the future unknowns   how much are those unknowns worth to you the tax implications are something else to consider   in your example of a small jackpot with $ 50,000 annual payouts it 's likely that you could still avoid the highest tax bracket each year whereas taking the lump sum would be taxed at the highest rate 35 of the amount above $ for a single filer in 2010   however this might not make much of a difference for large jackpots with higher annual payouts with the lump sum option you also have a greater potential of investment returns and losses since you can put all the money to work for you right away   it also allows you to purchase larger assets sooner if that 's something that interests you in the end i 'd say the reduced risk and the higher return potential of the lump sum option is well worth the reduced payout   i 'd also suggest not playing the lottery

i agree with you in that i think social pressures can contribute to the abandoning of stem subjects at a young age however i would argue that these biases are experienced by both young men and women i ca n't recall there ever being a situation where a subject was viewed as or detrimental to the social of female students but not male students    what i think holds more weight is the idea you last mentioned which was the need for female students to be encouraged personally i believe that the outdated views of older is still spilling into younger in the form of parents and teachers counselors while the article is quite lengthy a big portion of it discusses how male students were encouraged to tough out classes subjects when they began to face difficulties whereas female students receive fewer arguments from their parents teachers or guidance counselors if they drop a physics class or shrug off an ap exam

from what i understand they basically hold on to your money while you stop paying your debt   they keep it in an account and negotiate on your behalf the longer you go without paying the less the debt collector is willing to take and at some point they will settle   so they take the money you 've been putting into their account and pay it down   repeat the process for all your accounts i basically did this without using a service i had $ 17,000 on one card and they bumped the interest rate to 29 and i had lost my job i did n't pay it for 7 months   i just planned on filing bankruptcy   they finally called me up and said if you can pay $ 250 a month until it 's paid off we will drop the interest to 0 and forgive all your late fees i did that and five years later it was paid off similar situation happened on my other cards   it seems once they realize you ca n't pay is when they 're willing to give you a break   it 'd be nice they just never jacked up your rate to 30 though so forget the service just do it yourself   call them up and ask and if they do n't budge do n't pay it of course your credit will be shot   but i 'm back in the so anything is possible over time

at no point is it ever a good idea to stop making payments to show them you mean business when you signed up for the credit card account you agreed to pay what you charged and any applicable interested accrued on the accounts you are legally responsible for that debt and you can be sued if they are so inclined many times settlement agencies are employed because a risk assessment operator or whatever they 're called at your cc company calculated that they are currently financially better off settling for a reduced balance than attempting to chase you for the full amount as soon as the terms of your refinance hits your credit history that changes to reiterate and make it clear this is a very dangerous approach to breaking credit card debt and i would not advise that anybody proceed with it edit if you offer 50 of the balance in a lump sum payment they decline and you continue with non payment they have reason to believe that you are financially capable of making payments and are much more likely to seek legal action

excellent question and it is a debate that is often raised   mathematically you are probably best off using option 1   any money that is above and beyond minimum payments earns a pretty high interest rate about in the form of saved interest payments the problem is you are likely to get discouraged   personal finance is a lot about behavior and after working at this for a year and still having 5 loans albeit a lower balance might take a bit of fight out of you paying off such a large balance in a reasonable time will take a lot of fight with the debt snowball you pay the minimum to the student loan save in an outside account and when it is large enough you execute option 2   so a year from now you might only have three loans instead of five   if you behaved exactly the same your balance would be higher after that year then using the previous method however often one does not behave the same   because the goals are shorter and more attainable it is easier to delay some gratification   the 8 dollars you are saving in your weekly gas budget because of low prices is meaningful when saving for a 4 k goal where it is meaningless when looking at it as a 74 k goal   with the 4 k goal you are more apt to put that money in your savings where the 74 k goal you might spend it on a latte for me the debt snowball worked really well with either option make sure that excess payments actually go to a reduction in principle not a prepayment of interest   given this you may be left with no option   for example if method 1 you only prepay interest you are forced to use option 2

gt;when a business entity is so large and powerful its failure threatens the safety and well being of the nation it is based present in   do n't you think we should approach this issue from the other side and say that the government should be enforcing these restrictions pre in other words firms should be prevented from attaining too big to fail status it seems a bit controversial to me for a government to go in after the fact and forcefully break up a private company where was the government beforehand   gt;the government should be able to forcefully break up the company into smaller groups or laws and regulations that promote competition and allow smaller businesses the ability to compete   how is management distributed across the new entities how is intellectual property distributed it is easy to say we should break these companies up but actually breaking them up is a nightmare each of the new companies will need a duplicate management structure and invariably they will have to source outside resources to fill these roles if one firm retains the more valuable management then it has an advantage over the other firm the same goes for intellectual property or any other rare or unique assets shareholders will not receive the same dividend yield from their shares because the two companies once split will lose out on some economies of scale should the government compensate shareholders for the lost value of their shares if not why not and how is this different from the government directly seizing assets of the shareholders even though they have not committed any crime bear in mind nearly every american citizen owns shares in these companies through their retirement funding and so any loss in market cap will affect normal people not just rich investors   preservation   once again i think we need to be asking a different question how did these firms come to exist in the first place its one thing to turn around and plead to the government to break the firms up but it as the government itself which was asleep on the job and allowed the firm to reach this point anyway should we really trust the government who let the firms come into being to break them up again

dan 's link he deleted his answer btw is fine it showed the components of the score fico offers   each input has data behind it a bell curve of the behaviors and risk of the person behind it for example we 've discussed utilization many time here the ideal utilization is not 0 but 1 19 this does not mean paying interest or carrying charges from month to month   say i had just one card with a $ 10 k limit i 'd want to be sure i never ran a bill above $ 2000 if i did i 'd see a slight drop in my score and next month it would go back to normal in my case i have enough available credit that going over 20 is rare and if it happened i 'd pay the bill down before the bill was issued just make a mid cycle payment   fico decided that those who go over 20 have a higher risk of default and it gets higher as it goes up same with every aspect of the score 's components   you are comparing us to non us use in the us it seems far more common to use our cards in my family 's case we use very little cash and run most of our spending through our cards   as far as the david is concerned one should separate those who carry a balance from those who pay in full the pay in full users are better off for their habits and responsible card use in the us it 's not easy to rent a car or book a hotel with no card cards offer a cash rebate that adds up fast and purchase protection from fraudulent vendors they also offer extended warranty coverage   the david and others claim that studies prove those using cards spend 10 15 more than cash buyers this is a proven fact from scientific studies only they do n't exist the best i 've seen proves that college kids given a $ 20 bill spend more carefully than those given a $ 20 credit card this does n't extrapolate to a family budget and never will but that quote has a way of being repeated as fact yes it 's non sense thank you for reading and quoting my blog i recognize the quote   the report also shows accounts that have gone to collection an electric bill is n't a regularly reported item it 's assumed your lights are on but if you stop paying the bill and they send your account to a collection agency you 'll see it hit your report   in response to the comment below journal of experimental psychology applied article titled monopoly money the effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior runs 13 pages but on the first page offers do consumers spend differently when using one payment mode relative to another mode for example do consumers spend more when they receive $ 50 in the form of a gift card than in the form of cash if indeed they do then why this research addresses these issues   $ 50 a $ 50 gift card is a nuisance i try to use it up within hours of getting one as i stated above the behavior of a person with such a card does n't scale to a many thousand per month budget such articles in my opinion are nonsense proving nothing   unfortunately this is a bit of a tangent to the original question and if i put up a stand alone is it a fact that people spend more if using a card than cash the question would result in being closed as one that 's seeking opinions not facts

dividends are a way of distributing profits from operating a business to the business owners why would you call it wasting money is beyond me decisions about dividend distribution are made by the company based on its net revenue and the needs of future capital in some jurisdictions the us for example the tax policy discourages companies from accumulating too much earnings without distributing dividends unless they have a compelling reason to do so stock price is determined by the market the price of a stock is neither expensive nor cheap on its own you need to look at the underlying company and the share of it that the stock represents in case of google according to some analysts the price is actually quite cheap the analyst consensus puts the target price for the next 12 months at $ vs. current $

i thought the other answers had some good aspect but also some things that might not be completely correct so i 'll take a shot as noted by others there are three different types of entities in your question   the etf spy the index spx and options contracts first let 's deal with the options contracts   you can buy options on the etf spy or marked to the index spx   either way options are about the price of the etf index at some future date so the local min and max of the underlying symbol generally will not coincide with the min and max of the options   of course the closer the expiration date on the option the more closely the option price tracks its underlying directly   beyond the difference in how they are priced the options market has different liquidity and so it may not be able to track quick moves in the underlying although there 's a reasonably robust market for option on spy and spx specifically second let 's ask what forces really make spy and spx move together as much as they do   it 's one thing to say spy is tied to spx but how   there are several answers to this but i 'll argue that the most important factor is that there 's a notion of authorized participants who are players in the market who can create shares of spy at will   they do this by accumulating stock in the constituent companies and turning them into the market maker   there 's also the corresponding notion of redemption by which an authorized participant will turn in a share of spy to get stock in the constituent companies see and meanwhile spx is just computed from the prices of the constituent companies so it 's got no market forces directly on it   it just reflects what the prices of the companies in the index are doing of course those companies are subject to market forces key point creation redemption is the real driver for keeping the price aligned   if it gets too far out of line then it creates an arbitrage opportunity for an authorized participant   if the price of spy gets too high compared to spx and therefore the constituent stocks an authorized participant can simultaneously sell short spy shares and buy the constituent companies stocks   they can then use the redemption process to close their position at no risk   and vice versa if spy gets too low now that we understand why they move together why do n't they move together perfectly   to some extent information about fees slight differences in composition between spy and spx over time etc do play   the bigger reasons are probably that a there are not a lot of authorized participants b there are a relatively large number of companies represented in spy so there 's some actual cost and risk involved in trying to quickly buy sell the full set to capture the theoretical arbitrage that i described and c redemption creation units only come in pretty big blocks which complicates the issues under point b. you asked about dividends so let me comment briefly on that too   the dividend on spy is more or less passing on the dividends from the constituent companies i think not completely sure that the market maker deducts its fees from this cash so it 's not a direct pass through   but each company pays on its own schedule and spy does not make a payment every time so it 's holding a corresponding amount of cash between its dividend payments   this is factored into the price through the creation redemption process   i do n't know how big of a factor it is though

the biggest question is do you want to be a landlord there are a lot of ups and down to managing property from bad tenants to having to fix a water heater or replace a fridge    if you are n't interested in being a landlord it is definitely a bad idea    if you do want to be a landlord then the question is how close do you want to be to your tenants    what if they are up late making noise etc    what if they watch tv all night and you hear it through the walls    what is your plan    you ask if people have trouble sharing a house    if you are the landlord and the other party the tenant then you are n't sharing you are leasing    it 's a different relationship with different strains

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

have you looked at conventional financing rather than va   va loans are not a great deal   conventional tends to be the best and fha being better than va   while your rate looks very competitive it looks like there will be a .5 fee for a refinance on top of other closing costs    if i have the numbers correct you are looking to finance about 120 k and the house is worth about   given your salary and equity you should have no problem getting a conventional loan assuming good enough credit    while the 30 year is tempting the thing i hate about it is that you will be 78 when the home is paid off   are you intending on working that long   also you are the clock on your mortgage   presumably you have paid on it for a number of years and now you will start that long journey over if you were to take the 15 year how much would go to retirement   you claim that the $ 320 in savings will go toward retirement if you take the 30 year but could you save any if you took the 15 year all in all i would rate your plan a   it is a plan that will allow you to retire with dignity and is not based on crazy assumptions   your success comes in the execution   will you actually put the $ 320 into retirement or will the needs of the kids come before that   a strict budget is really a key component with a stay at home spouse the a+ plan would be to get the 15 year and put about $ 650 toward retirement each month   its tough to do but what sacrifices can you make to get there   can you move your plan a bit closer to the ideal plan one thing you have not addressed is how you will handle college for the kids   while in the process of long term planning you might want to get on the same page with your wife on what you will offer the kids for help with college   a viable plan is to pay their room and board have them work and for them to pay their own tuition to community college   they are responsible for their own spending money and transportation    thank you for your service

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

it depends on when you 're setting the goal 1 when you have finished the year and you are filling out tax forms your goal is to get as large of a refund as possible 2 when the year begins and you are earning money and paying taxes your goal should be roughly to pay exactly the amount of tax owed so that at the end of the year you do n't have any refund or tax owed it 's the same as getting your tax refund right away rather than waiting until after you file taxes   so you want your w4 set up appropriately assuming you 're talking about the us i think 1 is obvious   for 2 imagine you start the year with the goal to get the largest possible tax refund at the end   well that 's simple fill out the w4 and on line 6 additional amount if any you want withheld from each paycheck tell them to withhold everything   then at the end of the year you 'll get a huge refund   of course in the meantime you 've made an interest free loan to the government and you 've probably had to take out a high interest rate loan from your bank or credit card   obviously this is bad an argument could be made that it would be even better to slightly underpay your taxes but not enough to owe a penalty   ignoring human weakness this is correct   if you have the discipline to set that money aside in a safe place that 's okay   if this would cause you to spend that money or even save less of your other money then this is a bad idea   so i 'd really want to highlight some of this depends on your own financial discipline is it better for you to have the money right away so that you can make good choices with how to use it now or is it better for you to put the money somewhere out of reach so that you wo n't spend it on impulse purchases   and recognize that there are ways to put it out of reach and earn interest on it rather than spending it one good choice for you would be a roth ira

most of the consumer products that you buy at retail these days are commodity priced and have been for a long time margins are thin so if there are retail salespeople about their compensation is n't coming from the tv or computer with a 6 gross margin it comes from the extended warranty programs which are not insurance and do not have regulated underwriting standards which are typically sold at a 65 95 gross margin so that $ 200 warranty most likely costs the retailer $ 50 the salesman gets $ 15 25 i paid for my college education working at a selling these things along with other high margin items that paid commission in most cases you are n't getting much coverage anyway most products carry a 1 year warranty and using most gold or platinum credit cards doubles a manufacturer 's warranty by up to 1 year so with most transactions you are already walking away with a 2 year warranty   warranties or service plans make sense for durable goods that cost alot and are expected to last a long time and/or require regular maintenance i think they especially make sense if your budget is really tight a fixed maintenance cost can be an asset to some people because they can plan around it examples of this include service plans for a furnace boiler or water heater or a car if you 're buying a manufacturer endorsed service maintenance plan from a dealer

there should be   the canadian pension plan investment board is one of the most well funded pension plans in the world your question is also their 1 faq unlike many other countries the measures were taken long ago in that the fund was set up to be sustaining from investments and contributions rather than just contributions that said the amount that cpp pays is not very much   the maximum benefit is about $ 11,000 per year and not many people i know can live on that little   so you really should be trying to do something to augment that if you are able

many of the custodians ie schwab file for an extension on 1099s   they file for an extension as many of their accounts have positions with foreign income which creates tax reporting issues   if they did not file for extension they would have to send out 1099s at the end of january and then send out corrected forms   obviously sending out one 1099 is cheaper and less confusing to all   hope that helps

payment history is probably the most significant contributor to your credit score   having a solid history of making at least the minimum payments on time will have a positive impact on your credit score   whether or not this specific transaction means anything to that equation is up for debate    if you have no credit lines now and 0 for 18 months on a computer makes sense to you then yes making this purchase this way and paying on time will have a positive impact on your credit score   paying interest does n't help your credit score   repay this computer before the 18 month period ends then be sure to pay your balance in full every month thereafter

flipping usually refers to real estate transaction you buy a property improve renovate it and resell it quickly the distinction between flipper and investor is similar to the distinction between trader and investor even though the tax code does n't explicitly refer to house flipping gains on house flipping can be considered as active business gain or passive activity income which are treated differently passive income goes on schedule e and schedule d active income goes on schedule c. the distinction between passive and active is based on the characteristics of the activity hours you spent on it among other things trading income can similarly be considered as either passive schedule d e treatment or active schedule c treatment here 's what the irs has to say about traders special rules apply if you are a trader in securities in the business    of buying and selling securities for your own account this is    considered a business even though you do not maintain an inventory    and do not have customers to be engaged in business as a trader in    securities you must meet all of the following conditions the following facts and circumstances should be considered in    determining if your activity is a securities trading business if the nature of your trading activities does not qualify as a    business you are considered an investor investor in this context means passive income treatment schedule d e however even if your income is considered active schedule c stock sale proceeds are not subject to the self employment tax as you can see there 's no specific definition but the facts and circumstances matter you may be considered a trader by the irs or you may not you may want to be considered a trader for example to be able to make a mark to market election or you may not you should talk to a professional tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state for more details and suggestions

buying pressure is when there are more buy orders than sell orders outstanding   just because someone wants to buy a stock does n't mean there 's a seller ready to fill that order   when there 's buying pressure stock prices rise   when there 's selling pressure stock prices fall there can be high volume where buying and selling are roughly equal in which case share prices would n't move much the market makers who actually fill buy and sell orders for stock will raise share prices in the face of buying pressure and lower them in the face of selling pressure   that 's because they get to keep the margin between what they bought shares from a seller for and what they can sell them to a new buyer for   here 's an explanation from about buying pressure buying pressure can basically be defined as increasingly higher demand for a particular stock 's shares this demand for shares exceeds the supply and causes the price to rise the strength or weakness of a stock determines how much buying or selling interest will be required to break support and resistance areas i hope this helps

if the savings rate is the same as the loan rate mathematically it does n't make any difference whether you pay down the loan more and save less or vice versa however if the loan rate is higher than the savings rate it 's better to pay it down as fast as possible the chart below compares paying down the loan and saving equally the gradual scenario versus paying down the loan quickly at 2 x $ and then saving 2 x $   the savings rate for illustration is 2 paying quickly pays down the loan completely by month 51   on the other hand in the gradual scheme the loan ca n't be paid down with the savings until month 54 which then leaves 3 months less for saving   in conclusion it 's better to pay down the higher rate loan first   practically speaking it may be useful to have some savings available

gt;for it departments internally billing is essential for managing expectations otherwise they are treated as an endless pool of free resources   it chargeback internal billing can and i have seen this in action also work the opposite way it can allow it to tax other departments and continue to operate   the devil is always in the details and the chief problem with chargeback systems is when things are   for example charging set rates to each department based on cpu count regardless of whether one unit in one department is a high power cad station or file server and the equivalent of a in other departments or likewise by the number of printers regardless of type charging a massive printer the same $ 500 per unit annual support cost as a label printer that only cost $ 50 retail etc   and likewise with the it should n't actually charge back labor you still create the endless pool of resources problem just in the form of labor rather than equipment   basically internal charge back systems can function if they are properly constructed and properly adjusted to take into account different and changing costs but far too many companies implement such a thing and then let it where it ends up creating the same kinds of unnecessary and troublesome distortions that it was purportedly put in place to solve

as a former consumer credit counselor who worked with struggling homeowners and first time homebuyers i would argue that it is a mistake for lenders to rely on gross income and assumptions on what an applicant spends their income on i think lenders do this because they believe it is efficient and may not understand the long term ramifications for the stakeholders e.g. the borrower the lender the servicer the investor the broker the taxpayer the marshall the foreclosure lawyers etc or lenders do know the impact of a superficial mortgage screening and intentionally want to enrich themselves in the short term while harming other stakeholders in the long term developing a budget that reflects what a person can realistically spend on their mortgage takes much longer than signing up for a rocket mortgage i would say an hour minimum for the first appointment to get a baseline and at least two follow up appointments to make soon after or whenever a borrower 's financial situation changes dramatically credit counselors factor in all of the factors mentioned above i.e. take home pay future pay vs current pay the ability to adjust deductions seasonal expenses multiple sources of income and their frequency debt load etc budgets are always fluctuating but when it is done right by a qualified professional the result is a much more accurate financial picture   the consequences for not doing this type of old school due diligence or for willfully choosing to skip it are varied first off mortgages will be given to homeowners who should never have qualified in the first place and likewise denied to homeowners who should qualify this will result in market distortion and this distortion was a primary contributor to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the wave of foreclosures that came with it another consequence is the stripping of wealth from minority communities since they are often targeted by the most unscrupulous of lenders additionally the securitization of mortgages based on poor diligence at the loan officer level means loan portfolio ratings are questionable investors will lose money and small banks who are heavily invested will fail as they did in the past depending on the federal enforcement of dodd frank act the taxpayers may or may not have to pick up the bill from a bailout of a big mortgage bank that was too big to fail via higher taxes lost jobs lost homes and other negative externalities that were not accounted for by the loan officer or willfully ignored   lastly borrowers also have a responsibility to provide accurate financial information which they do n't always do unfortunately in a capitalistic society where property is commoditized instead of communal there is always mistrust competition the fear that you will be left behind or the desire to get ahead this could incentivize cheating by either the borrower the broker lender or both in this example e.g. no doc negative loans this is just one of many other negative externalities so the only true fix would be a switch to communal land ownership in the interim i would push for universal borrower access to low cost consumer credit counselors and a change in loan officer training and incentive structure

senate vs. house health care bills   summarized from   1 reduces   subsidies from eligibility from 400 percent of the   federal poverty line which is a hair under $ 100,000 a year for a family of four to 350 percent of the poverty line which is about $   2 reduces premium subsidies which determines the subsidy level which should cover about 70 percent of anticipated health expenses to one with an actuarial value of 58 percent causing people to opt for plans with higher deductibles to offset effects on the elderly the bill   changes the subsidy formula to account for age   3 obamacare 's   growth subsidy cap on premium subsidies   changed from percent of gdp 0.4 percent of gdp meaning program cap   is more likely to hit cutting subsidies to some groups   4 eliminates the individual and employer mandates   may   destabilize the obamacare exchanges and subsidies   5 restricts the already small abortion coverage   6 ends the cost sharing reductions   that lowered out of pocket expenditures for people making less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line not   funded since republicans took over congress the bill pays the insurers the money they ’ve been owed ending the program makes obamacare significantly less attractive for the folks whose policies are so heavily subsidized   7 states given   a great deal more flexibility expedite waiver program with less interference from federal regulators   8) eliminates many obamacare taxes on everything from to high earners   the cadillac tax on pricey employer sponsored insurance postponed until ending an attempt   to our nation ’s hog wild tax subsidies for employer sponsored insurance   presumably senators are keeping the tax in after doing so reduces the apparent cost of a full repeal   9 market stabilization funds designed   to keep the dreaded death spiral from happening by dealing with the major problem driving costs on the exchanges very sick people   details on this are sketchy because states are expected to design programs to meet the goal   if it works it has the potential to substantially improve the sustainability of the exchanges   10 winds down the medicaid expansion funding but not as fast as the house bill    11 it also makes people below the poverty threshold eligible to buy exchange policies with subsidies this coverage is not as generous as medicaid it will probably involve substantial deductibles and but the premiums are capped at 2 percent of family income which for a single person making exactly the federal poverty line would be about $ 20 a month    12 converts medicaid to a per capita allotment rather than an open ended entitlement   like the house bill the senate bill changes the program to a per beneficiary grant based on previous spending levels   it ’s not the block granting of supply dreams but it ’s close this will give states heavy incentives to keep program growth in check especially with future payment growth will be indexed to general inflation rather than the higher medical inflation states can also apply to switch to a block grant formula or to implement a work requirement for medicaid recipients

from some background reading i 'm doing it sounds like the union has people by the proverbial balls anyway even in an agency shop where union membership is optional non members must pay for the collective bargaining done by the union and union shop just means that the employer can hire anybody but they must join the union in order to be employed all of those seem to indicate that every worker in the represented class must accept the terms of the collective bargaining wiki   part of the reason that i 'm curious is that once i 've decided that i 'm done being an engineer i think it might be fun to teach but every time i hear about union negotiations it makes me think that operating in that system would be lame going from a world where merit is the primary differentiator to a world where years in the system count for more would kinda suck

institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral meaning that for every options contract they buy or write they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset this as a theory is called max pain which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors this as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors the is that many times a stock gets to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days like or by closing bell at options expiration dates many options contracts are being closed and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades to keep liquidity so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset to remain delta neutral when the contract closes or get rid of the option they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset at mass volume of options traded this would cause noticeable downward pressure similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought the result is a stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest this tends to happen in more liquid stocks than less liquid ones to answer that question as they have more options series and more strike prices no this would not be illegal in the us attempting to mark the close is supposedly prohibited but this would n't count as it the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the sec 's current enforcement regime although an active area of research
