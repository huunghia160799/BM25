the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

as per the age of your son you mentions i would suggest yes charge them an interest amount but lesser than the market rate and give them a valid reason behind taking interest on given amount the reason you might grab from below real incident happen with me at the time of last year i am 26 and i am currently doing job and my salary is not so much that i can accomplish all my dreams of buying expensive watch and many things so i borrowed some strong amount from my mom she gave me the amount but she asked me to pay interest of 5 and when i asked the reason behind demanding the interest she said something which was valuable things she said me if i would not give you money then you will definitely ask money from some money lenders or your friends because now that watch is your first priority and in that case you need to pay the higher interest rate to them and in life there might be situation where we would not capable to help you in terms of financial so this is the time you should learn to pay interest and responsibility of borrowing amount and repaying it on time with interest rate this will help you also to learn a lesson and our money will be withing home i am not expert in parenting because i am still unmarried but i shared my point of view for your question thanks

someone entering a casino with $ 15 could employ a very simple strategy and have a better chance of walking out with $ 16   unfortunately the person would have a non trivial chance about one in 14 of walking out with $ 0 if after losing $ 15 the person withdrew $ 240 from the bank and tried to win $ 16 the person would have a better chance of succeeding and ending up ahead holding the original $ 15 plus the additional $ 240 plus $ 1 but would have at that point about a one in 14 chance from that point of losing the $ 240 along with the original $ 15   measured from the starting point you 'd have about a 199 out of 200 chance of gaining $ 1 and a one out of 200 chance of losing $ 240 market timing bets are like that   you can arrange things so you have a significant chance of making a small profit but at the risk of a large downside   if you have n't firmly decided exactly how much downside you are willing to accept it 's very easy to simultaneously believe you do n't have much money at risk but that you 'll be able to win back anything you lose   the only way you can hope to win back anything you lose is by bringing a lot more money to the table which will of course greatly increase your downside risk the probability of making money for the person willing to accept $ 15 of downside risk to earn $ 1 is about 93   the probability of making money for the person willing to accept $ 255 worth of risk is about   it 's easy to see that there are ways of playing which have a chance of winning and that there are ways of playing that only have a downside risk   unfortunately the ways of playing that have the smaller risk do n't have anything near a 99.9 chance of winning and those that have a better chance of winning have a much larger downside risk

nah what you 're seeing is pretty representative of subreddit and i agree with you that it 's a shame   i think about business ethics a lot to the point where i got my mba in sustainable business and i firmly believe that the only way to understand how to bring about positive change is to understand the goals and strategies of an organization and the barriers or reasons they may not want or even ca n't change to be more of a positive part of society    most people are satisfied imagining businesses as a sentient evil mustache villain because understanding businesses as a complex organization is too abstract to bother participating in take supply chains for example many users would rather believe that a ceo is giving his thumbs up to employ child slave labor so he can pay for a bigger yacht than understand the reality that supply chains are incredibly deep and complex networks that is hard to really track   all people really care about is farming karma repeating whatever john oliver says on tv and then themselves for participating in the improvement of society because they got mad about something it 's painfully and i do n't even bother posting my thoughts anymore because 9 times out of 10 playing devil 's advocate into someone accusing me of being a corporate shill   i actually do a much better job reaching out to people in larger subreddits like because people on there are n't automatically anti business like here also i do n't follow it closely but there do seem to be more supportive subreddits out there for small business ownership and management

that 's a pretty good writeup the conclusion is worth noting here   gt;he believes that when you add all the environmental impacts they still come out in favor of electric vehicles the union of concerned scientists agrees it found that even when you add in emissions from battery manufacturing evs generate half the emissions of a conventional car over the course of its life still consumers and investors should understand what it takes to make the materials that enable their green choices    electric cars still seem to come out on top though they could get better we need to be aware of the issues so we can hopefully push for better mining practices for greener energy and for awareness of potential trouble points such as recycling

things are in fact more complicated it really depends what you mean by ticker and who gave you this ticker there is several codes to identify a security the bloomberg code contains a code to identify the exchange as in fp the fp part refers to paris the code works the same way but with a different convention exchanges are identified by the mic are in fact divided in market segments with each market segment having a main market segment isin and sedol codes do not provide about the exchange so they are usually given with a mic there is no guarantee that reuters and bloomberg wo n't use the same company code to refer to different company   but they usually use the exchange ticker this ticker is requested by each company and can be anything they are accepted most of the time but sometimes to avoid confusion some requests are rejected for instance fbi ticker was refused for more info read the evolution of ticker symbols financial providers like bloomberg provides services to be informed when a security is added removed from a market

the problem with short would be that even if the stock eventually falls it might raise a lot in the meantime and unless you have enough collateral you may not survive till it happens   to sell shares short you first need to borrow them as naked short is currently prohibited in us as far as i know now to borrow you need some collateral which is supposed to be worth more that the asset you are borrowing and usually substantially more otherwise the risk for the creditor is too high suppose you borrowed 10 k worth of shares and gave 15 k collateral numbers are totally imaginary of course suppose the shares rose so that total cost is now at this moment you will probably be demanded to either raise more collateral or close the position if you can not thus generating you a 4 k loss little use it would be to you if next day it fell to 1 k you already lost your money   as keynes once said markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent see also another answer which other issues with short selling as noted by options may be a safer way to do it or a short etf like lists of those are easy to find online

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

you do n't generally pay capital gains taxes until you sell the stock if you bought it in 2013 and the price goes up in 2014 but you just hold on to the stock you wo n't have to pay any taxes on it if you then sold it in 2015 for a profit you 'd have to pay capital gains taxes on the profit note that this excludes dividends dividends may complicate the matter somewhat i 'm also assuming you are in the u.s. or canada or a country like one of those two it 's possible some other country does taxes differently though it 'd surprise me

i got a ba in econ from a mid tier public school in ca and i graduated near the trough of the great recession so my experience may not represent what current and future graduates can expect it took a couple of years of shit jobs but i eventually got into banking a matter of who you know and after almost 5 years i could n't stand it anymore so i am starting my ms in econ at an also mid tier public ca school i ca n't compare to cs and my advice will differ from 's   1 never assume that jobs will we thrown at you especially a job that you actually want like and will make a career the job market is strong and you ought to be able to get an entry level analyst position if you can show you have strong econometrics many schools require you to do a research paper for your senior seminar instead of a graduation exam i recommend to choose a topic with good data available   2 all the government jobs i 've looked at required at least a master 's that said the roi on a phd is rarely worth it if you have to take on debt to do it you might be able to get your foot in the door with a bachelor 's but you wo n't be able to progress up the job ladder i suggest being a little more open minded about potential employers there are way more options when you consider consulting or business development for larger corporations   3 economics majors make the most out of the social scientists by far last i checked it was 60 80k depending on local market but i imagine that trails cs majors significantly you should be able to afford a decent standard of living in either field so certainly consider more on the basis of what kind of work you get the most satisfaction from   4 with an undergrad degree you will start in local government you may then be able to jump to state and then federal levels after 5 10 years experience but still may find it difficult if you forgo the master 's i have not personally worked as an economist but i do know you will spend a lot of time searching for collecting data writing or using statistical analysis programs to process it and writing up your reports   5 go search analyst on and you 'll find myriad positions in everything from finance to marketing to supply chain etc which ask for degrees in business finance or other related field economics   in my opinion the prestige of the university from which you graduate is secondary to the work you do   assuming you do a research paper if it is kick ass it wo n't matter much if you went to harvard or not check your city county jobs site for internship opportunities since no matter what even getting an entry level job can be difficult if you 've never had any job experience in the field or related field   labor economics is big since there 's a lot of good data and it is a hot topic personally i 'm focusing on urban economics real estate planning and transportation the beauty of econ is that it is so broad you can almost do whatever you want but the drawback is that it is so broad it can be tough to show employers that you possess the specific skills and knowledge that make you desirable   hope this helps

firstly you have to know exactly what you are asking here   what you have if you own bitcoins is a private key that allows you to make a change to the blockchain that can assign a piece of information from yourself to the next person nothing more nothing less   the fact that this small piece of information is considered to have a market value is a matter of opinion and is to owning a domain name a domain name is an entry in a register that has equal weight to all other entries but the market determines if that information eg has any more value than say another less well know domain bitcoin is the same an entry in a register and the market decides which entry is more valuable than another   so what exactly are you wanting to declare to fincen are you willing to declare the ownership of private key of course not so what then an private key can be generated at will by anyone without even needing to own or transact in bitcoins and that same private key would be equally valid on any of the 1000 's of other bitcoin the point i want to make is that owning a private key in itself is not valuable therefore you do not need nor would anyone advise notifying fincen of that fact to put this into context every time you connect to online banking your computer secretly generates a new random private key to secure your communications with the bank theoretically that same private key could also be used to sign a bitcoin transaction do you need to declare every private key your computer generates no secondly if you are using any of the latest generation of hd wallets your private key changes with every single transaction are you seriously saying that you want to take it on your shoulders to inform fincen every time you move information bitcoin amounts around even in your own wallets the fact is fincen could never discover your ownership of bitcoins or any of the 1000s of alt coins other than by you informing them of this fact   you may want to carefully consider the personal implications of starting down this road especially as all fincen would need to do is subpoena your bitcoin private key to steal your so called funds as they have done recently to other more prominent persons in the community edit to clarify the points raised in comments you do not own the private key to the bitcoins stored on a foreign exchange nor can you discover it the exchange owns the private key you therefore do not either technically have control over the coins is a very good example here they went out of business because they allowed their private keys to be used by some other party who was able to siphon off the coins your balance is only yours when you own the private keys and the ability to spend any other situation you can neither recover the bitcoin to sell to pay for any taxes due so you do not either have the legal right nor the technical right to consider those coins in your possession   for those who do not understand the technical or legal implications of private key ownership please do not speculate about what owning bitcoin actually means or how ownership can be discovered holding bitcoin is not illegal and the us government who until recently were the single largest holder of bitcoin demonstrate simply by this fact alone that there is nothing here

am i allowed to transfer into nre account from paypal credits into nre accounts are restricted it has to be established that the funds being credited are income outside of india in case of paypal paypal uses local clearing to credit funds into bank accounts so essentially one can not credit nre account by domestic clearing network like it is best that you withdraw the funds into bank account outside india and use swift or remittance service to credit your nre account i do not want to transfer to an nro account since the money credited into it will become taxable this is not the right assumption credits into nro are not taxable by default if you establish that the funds are from outside india there is no tax on the income money transferred from abroad into the nro account however the interest that will be paid by the bank on the balance of the nro account is taxable income in india and is subject to tds in contrast interest paid on the balance in an nre account is not taxable in india and is not subject to tds as long as you maintain nri status however it does make sense to keep accounts segregated i.e. income generated in india credit the nro account and income generated outside india credit to nre

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

this is assuming that you are now making some amount x per month which is more than the income you used to have as a student otherwise the question seems rather moot all figures should be net amounts after taxes first figure out what the difference in your cost of living is that is housing electricity utilities the basics that you need to have to have a place in which to live i 'm not considering food costs here unless they were subsidized while you were studying basically you want to figure out how much you now have to spend extra per month for basic sustenance then figure out how much more you are now making compared to when you were a student subtract the sustenance extra from this to get your net pay increase after that is when it gets trickier basically you want to set aside or invest as much of the pay increase as possible but you probably have other expenses now that you did n't before and which you can not really do that much about this be particular types of clothes commute fares car gas bus pass or something entirely different anyway decide on a savings goal as a percentage of your net pay increase compared to when you were a student this might be 5 10 or if you are really ambitious 50 or more whichever number you pick make sure it 's reasonable giving your living expenses and keep in mind that anything is better than nothing find a financial institution that offers a high interest savings account preferably one with free withdrawals and sign up for one each and every time you get paid figure out how much to save based on the percentage you determined if your regular case is that you get the same payment each time you can simply set up an automated bank transfer put that in the savings account and for the moment forget about that money try your best to live only on the remainder but if you realize that you set aside too much do n't be afraid to tap into the savings account adjust your future deposits accordingly and try to find a good balance at the end of each month deposit whatever remains in your regular account into your savings account and if that is a sizable amount of money consider raising your savings goal a little the ultimate goal should be that you do n't need to tap into your savings except for truly exceptional situations but still keep enough money outside of the savings account to cater to some of your wants yes bank interest rates these days are often pretty dismal and you will probably be lucky to find a savings account that especially after taxes will even keep up with inflation but to start with what you should be focusing on is not to make money in terms of real value appreciation but simply figuring out how much money you really need to sustain a working life for yourself and then walking that walk eventually this may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year or more you should have settled pretty well on an amount that you feel comfortable with setting aside each month and just letting be by that time you should have a decently sized nest egg already which will help you get over rough spots and can start thinking about other forms of investing some of what you are setting aside whenever you get a net pay raise of any kind gross pay raise lower taxes bonus whichever increase your savings goal by a portion of that raise maybe give yourself 60 of the raise and bank the remaining 40 that way you are hopefully always increasing the amount of money that you are setting aside while also reaping some benefits right away one major upside of this approach is that if you lose your job not only will you have that nest egg you will also be used to living on less so you will have more money in the bank and less monthly expenses which puts you in a significantly better position than if you had only one of those let alone neither

first you must understand your marginal tax rate tax bracket   the exemptions you claim are like saying to your employer tax me on $ 4050 less or more for each change up or down of 1 exemption   say you look at the table 2016 tables at my main site and see you are in the 15 bracket and your refund is $ 2000 is $ so you want that $ 13 k to not be taxed raising exemptions by 3 = will get you close $ closer to your goal   for what it 's worth you can read through the instructions for the w4 of course but this answer skips through the details and gets you to your goal   one point to note since the exemption is in whole numbers and $ 4050 is it you will get close + $ if in the 15 bracket but to get dead on you 'd need a mid year adjustment not worth it a refund of under $ should be enough for a $ for a if you ready want to nail the taxes to a closer accuracy you can use the line requesting additional dollars be withheld   most w4 discussions miss this point   the exact number withheld by your employer comes from an irs document known as circular e but retrieved as publication 15 it will help you confirm the validity of my dirty shortcut method   what i do recommend is that you use a quick online tax calculator to do a dry run of you return early in the year if you see your withholding is off in either direction best to adjust as soon as possible   the numbers here now reflect 2016 's $ 4050 exemption recent question on money se have linked to this one prompting me to update for 2016

yes it can buy back the call but much before stock hits the $ 30 mark    let us say you got 1 $ from selling the call so the total money in your account is 4 $ + 1 $ = 5 $ when stock hits 10 $ your strike the maintenance margin is as soon as stock goes past 10 your maintenance margin is violated so broker will buy back your call at least ib does that it does not wait for a margin call now if the stock gapped up from 8 to yes broker will buy it back at 30 so your account will have a negative balance assume the call cost 20 $ when stock hit 30 your balance is 5 30 10 = -15 depending on broker i suppose they will ask you to bring your account balance back up to positive if they do n't do that they risk going out of business

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

every year you save your receipts track your expenses and when april comes around pay your taxes but what if you know of someone who is n't as honest as you are someone who on their income or information in order to be placed in a lower bracket   the internal revenue service irs estimates that americans underpay their articles tax by about $ billion every year according to barron 's the popular financial news website and magazine in fiscal 2009 the irs collected $ billion in enforcement revenue this process required the employment of thousands of revenue officers agents and special agents unfortunately this type of enforcement happens every year and often spans to multiple previous years in the end there is still a large amount of tax money that goes unpaid   there 's definitely a gap between the tax and the irs evaders are usually exposed due to a slip up on their part or a tip from a bystander if you 'd like to help close that gap you can but why should you and how is it done   why help the irs   nobody likes paying more than their fair share of taxes in order to compensate for others who intentionally evade theirs why should n't tax evaders give up a portion of their incomes to provide things that benefit the general good like roads and when you do reporting a tax cheat is like reporting a you 're just asking them to pay for something they 're trying to unfairly get for free   gather the evidence   the irs is not likely to pursue someone without good reason if the time and resources are going to be spent the odds need to be good that the efforts will result in a payoff besides determining who what where when and why the person his or her taxes the irs will need specific information type of violation availability of books or records having a hunch without supporting details just is n't good enough   also ensure that the evasion is financially significant enough for example stating that your neighbor failed to report a $ 50 babysitting earning is not going to interest the irs on the other hand if you work for a large business that you suspect is its income the irs will likely be very interested   blowing the whistle on a tax cheat   the irs may pay awards in exchange for valuable information that leads to the collection of taxes penalties interest or other amounts from the taxpayer according to the agency 's website there are various types of awards granted depending on the 's income level and classification business or individual the irs likely chooses to focus its efforts on these larger cases because they have a higher payoff it has also been suggested that higher income individuals have been found to cheat more frequently and for higher sums of money mostly because they tend to earn more self reported income   cover your assets   a complaint in order to spite an undesirable neighbor who does in fact pay taxes is not a good way to get revenge when you sign off on the irs form providing your report you are stating i declare under penalty of perjury that i have examined this application my accompanying statement and supporting documentation and that such application is true correct and complete to the best of my knowledge you do n't want to be found guilty of perjury   keep it legal   breaking into the cfo 's office at work to get evidence to support your claim is not a good idea the irs does n't want you to break the law to help find a tax cheat however if you are the bookkeeper for a company that is cheating on its taxes and part of your job involves working with documents that prove the company is cheating that paperwork would be acceptable to submit to the irs   while the irs wants to maintain your privacy if the case against the person you report ends up going to trial you could be asked to be a witness if you 're comfortable with that possibility go ahead and put your name on the report   reasons not to report a cheat   if your information is really just speculation it 's probably best to keep it to yourself as explained earlier in this article the irs does not have the resources to pursue your hunch   if you yourself are a tax cheat it might be best to stay in the clear there 's nothing that says that people who submit claims of cheating by others will have their own tax returns examined more carefully still it stands to reason that you would n't want to do anything to call irs attention to yourself if you 're not in compliance with its rules   if you helped plan or initiate the cheating of the person you are reporting it might be smart to think twice if you decide to report a crime in which you took part be prepared for the consequences and definitely do n't expect to receive a reward   as with many government processes there 's a lot of red tape to cut through therefore if you 're looking for fast cash you might want to look elsewhere it can take several years to complete an investigation of tax evasion and if there is no conviction there is no award not only does the irs have to determine guilt it has to actually collect the amount owed before paying you what 's more if the irs determines that your tip did not substantially contributed to the service 's detection and recovery of tax you will not receive an award   it 's also important to note that under some circumstances like attorney client confidentiality you may not be able to report tax cheating   other considerations   if you earn a whistle blower award it will need to be reported when you file your taxes if you 're blowing the whistle on your employer and you 're not planning to change jobs an irs audit could make your work situation extremely unpleasant this is n't to say that you should n't report someone who is cheating but it is something to consider   what 's next   if you decide to report the person or business you suspect of cheating use irs this form asks for basic information on the tax you are reporting the types of violations you believe to be committed the details of the violation and how you learned about it if you do not want to fill out this form you can also simply write the irs a letter if you are providing your name and want the possibility of receiving an award also submit irs form which is an application for the award   the bottom line   underpayment of federal income taxes and subsequently state income taxes is a serious problem the irs encourages people to submit tips by allowing anonymous submissions and offering generous rewards for who are willing to identify themselves if you can substantiate your claims and are willing to accept the potential consequences of reporting a tax cheat can be lucrative not only for the government but also for you   take control of your money    whether you ’re buying a home consolidating debt or planning a

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

gt i 'm not sure how to answer that it 's all just speculation the competition is waiting for the first big mover to do just what tsla is going being the first mover then coming in and wiping the floor with them   it 's very funny that you call an analysis of the current state of the industry speculation and then go on to talk about something you think is going to happen which by the way has had six years to happen and has n't yet   also it 's as if you do n't think first mover advantage exists   six years is a long time to build up a lead especially in automotive where product cycles and development times are so long   gt;if you want to argue that all of the last 30 years of free markets and the value of specialization is wrong go ahead   honestly look up the words vertical integration before continuing the conversation   and the word panasonic as well   gt;they are committing massive capital to old technology that 's a loser play but it will help the industry as a whole and those that are going to come in with the next generation of batteries while tsla is stuck with massive capital in lithium ion   but wait i thought you said they were wrong because actual battery companies are n't involved   and that actual battery companies know better than them   but i guess the actual battery companies do n't actually know anything and they should listen to an idiot on the internet who has so far proven himself to be wrong about everything he 's said   gt;it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are   well again if you listened to the call which is a pretty basic first step to talking about the quarterly results which for some reason you insist on continuing to do despite being completely ignorant of them then you might not be saying such stupid things   panasonic you see is a rather conservative japanese company   this is even mentioned in your article when they talk about plasma displays   this is why they are always measured in their public statements because that 's what japanese companies do   but as specified in the call panasonic 's actions as a partner to tesla have always been excellent   and if you actually bothered to read your own article you would see that they 've committed to 2 billion cells and 200 300 million for the factory   you know an actual battery company   and if you actually bothered to read any other article you would see that that very same quote of yours was followed up with however tesla is a very important partner to us and discussions are continuing we need to look very carefully at auto demand and respond appropriately so of course that means taking a step by step approach to investment   also there have been rumors of talks with lg and samsung should panasonic not decide to partner   i 'm not sure i believe the rumors and also i think they 're unnecessary because panasonic will be a full partner in the gigafactory   they know that tesla has been a huge source of profit for them and their automotive supply i.e. tesla has been one of the best performing parts of their company for some time now   mark my words panasonic 's investment will end up being approximately $ 1 billion all told   you can come back in a few years and check if you like   gt;to keep the sucks putting up money   you mean like an actual battery company   the ones putting up the money   so since your point was so reliant on actual battery companies having expertise and specialization and so on does that mean you 're now dropping that point because you realized your bullshit would n't fly and moving on to another sort of bullshit until one of them sticks   because if you 'd like to fix your ignorance i can help you with that   but if you would n't as seems to be the case it seems somewhat like a waste of time to continue trying to explain basic concepts to you

assuming you are paying into and eligible to collect regular employment insurance benefits for the job in question i do n't see how owning a side business would by itself affect your ability to participate in the program   many people own dormant businesses $ 0 revenue $ 0 income or businesses with insignificant net income e.g. a small table at the flea market or a fledgling web site with up front costs and no ad revenue yet i think what matters is if your side business generated income substantial enough to put you over a certain threshold then you may be required to repay a portion of the ei benefits received through the program   on this issue i found the following article informative how to make work sharing work for you from the globe mail 's report on business site   here 's a relevant quote if you work elsewhere during    the agreement and earn more than an    amount equal to 40 of your weekly    benefit rate that amount shall be    deducted from your work sharing    benefits payable that week the definitive source for information on the program is the service canada web site   in particular see the work sharing applicant guide which discusses eligibility criteria   section iv confirms the globe article 's statement above earnings received in any week    by a work sharing participant from    sources other than work sharing    employment that are in excess of an    amount equal to 40 or $ 75 whichever    is greater of the participant 's    weekly benefit rate shall be deducted    from the work sharing benefits payable    in that week finally here 's one more interesting article that discusses the program canada employment law march 30 2009

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

you do n't have to use an agent broker as you call it but it is strongly advised in some counties lawyers are required in some not check your local requirements similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and of money you will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service i 'm guessing here but it makes sense to me you will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company and it might be hard without an agent agents required by law to know all the details of the process and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into they have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports they know what to demand from the seller disclosures information etc they know how and from where to get the hoa docs and disclosures and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales comparable listings list vs sales statistics etc it is hard to do all that alone but if you do you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly i bought several properties in california and in other states and i would n't do it without an agent on my side but if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title mortgage insurance or resale then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent and there are people doing that

the home owner will knock 20 off the price of the house if the house is worth $ k then 20 is just a discount your landlord is offering   so your actual purchase price is $ 237 k and therefore a bank would have to lend you $ since the house is worth more than the loan you have equity   20 to be more accurate   another way to say is the bank only wants to loan you 80 of the value of the item securing the loan if you default on day one they can sell the house to somebody else for $ k and get a 20 return on their loan so this 20 you are worried about is n't actually money that anybody gives anybody else it is just a concept

sure just saying it does exist    also i do n't understand why people need to return stuff so much only thing i can see it being needed so much is people buying something solely to use it for a one time use then getting their money back or simply over shopping and not controlling their budget and need their money back after they realize they spent too much on shit they do n't need   i mean if i need to buy something i do some research find the best product for the price and get the best offer the first time unless it 's broken or defective i 've never had to return anything then again i 'm also not a compulsive shopper that blows my budget on shit i do n't need   i do n't know does n't seem like a make or break feature for me and wo n't sway which service i use either way

in general you will take home more in the us than in canada there are so many variables that is is impossible to provide a comprehensive answer that will cover all bases so here are a few hand waving statements two example calculator web sites for canada and the us chosen somewhat at random through google show that making $ 50,000 of either currency for the upcoming tax year in canada you would expect to pay about $ and for the us $   missing there are the state taxes however which also vary wildly the deductions adjustment and credits in both countries can really add up so if you have specific questions you should consult a tax specialist similarly both countries provide various tax sheltered investment structures that change the game somewhat over the long term

gift taxes kick in at around $ 13 k per giver per recipient per year that means that a straight up gift of $ 200 k as cash or a house will incur a tax it is possible however that if the father has a spouse he and the spouse could each give the mother and each child the full gift limit for a total of about $ 78 k per year and that money could be used by all 3 of them to buy the house jointly over a couple of years i think the children would have to be on the title since part of the gift money would be theirs and one is an adult as far as lending the money my in laws are our mortgage lenders and when we structured the loan it had to be at a market rate which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed rate mortgage independent of what we might actually qualify for or we could not deduct interest payments forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes if he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent free it might work but i 'm not sure it would in that case be an asset of his estate when he dies i do n't know anything about structuring it as a trust free rent could conceivably also be construed as a gift subject to the limits stated above disclaimer not a tax professional

that 's incredible i 'm a second year college student taking macro economics class a lot of these technical things are all news to me    thank you for the wealth of information    1 that 's an interesting thought does that basically translate to less tax on poor wealthy since there are a lot more of them in numbers to promote entrepreneurship    2 someone pointed that very thing out rich using money to grow their own wealth but would n't that mean as a byproduct jobs will be made i probably made another dangerous assumption here    3 i do n't think i understand this one at all what is compensation will you rephrase it for me   4 i hear that effective tax rate can be very misleading to the general public i learned how to calculate the average tax rate a few weeks ago and understood what the folks were talking about i did hear from my professor and the educational videos he had shown us that the capital   tax is one of the highest among the other oecd nations my question for that would be why ca n't we just close loop holes instead of choosing to slash capital tax i feel like the majority will be more than okay with closing the loopholes   5 i think citizens of the country aligning with the county 's companies without asking questions is a terrible and a dangerous idea asian depression in the mid 90 's really it for me since our family was practically evicted from korea major conglomerates held all the power and the federal government was really just a puppet i think it 's in each company 's best interest to further their own agenda and that agenda usually means bad for the majority let me know if i 'm way off base here but one person 's spending is another 's income so using that logic the company ca n't make money unless i spend money so we have a conflict of interest here because as a consumer i want to get the best deals be thrifty company wants to charge me as much as they can to maximize profits    thank you in advance for your time

i think that the answer by is good   i 'd add that the there 's a mathematically precise difference   gambling games are typically zero sum games which means that every dollar won by one person is lost by another if there 's a house taking a cut then it 's worse than zero sum but let 's ignore that for the moment    none of the markets that you mentioned are zero sum because it 's possible for both parties in the transaction to win since they typically have different objectives   if i buy stock i typically desire for it to go up to make money but if i sell stock i typically sell it because i want the money to do something else completely   the something else might be invest in another instrument if i think it 's better or i 'm rebalancing risk   it might also be to buy a house pay for college or if i 'm in retirement living on my investments to buy food   if the stock goes up the buyer won increased investment but the seller also won got the other thing that they wanted needed which they would not have been able to get had there not been a buyer willing to pay cash for the stock of course it 's possible that in some cases not everyone wins because there is risk but risk should not be considered synonymous with gambling because there 's varying degrees of risk in everything you do

gt let 's just say the insurance industry knows a lot more about underwriting than you do   i 'm sorry but that is a meaningless statement i work in insurance first as a consultant before retiring to work in insurance distribution a few years ago and i know that our industry frequently uses flawed or outdated methodologies due to the simple fact that insurance companies are very conservative and very resistant to change when it comes to changes to their core business unless you can show a direct negative impact on the bottom line caused by the currently used method you are unlikely to make any changes at all in this case if the entire us car insurance industry is using the same flawed system it wo n't affect a single company if they also stick to it    until 1996 before the current system was introduced insurance companies in germany used to rate liability insurance for cars almost exclusively by engine power output the industry had known that this method was fundamentally flawed since at least the late 1980s comprehensive and partial coverage had been rated by the new system for a few years at this point which had also taken years to work out but it took additional years of planning negotiations and cooperation by the entire industry to change to the new system for liability    so please do not ever assume that the insurance companies are the experts they know what they are doing it might very well be the case that they are stuck with flawed outdated systems simply because there is no sufficiently strong impulse to change what they do    the current tesla rate adjustment situation is a wonderful example of this it took aaa 5 years since the model s first came out to realise that their initial estimate was wrong it seems unlikely that the accident rate or repair costs have suddenly changed over the last year and take appropriate actions by late 2013 there were easily enough teslas on the road about 20,000 to get data yet nothing happened for nearly another 4 years

assuming the amount of your car payment and student loan are n't crazy you should be fine i would suggest starting with a baseline budget listing your monthly income and expenses be sure to include miscellaneous expenses like car maintenance insurance food clothes etc the common things that sometimes get overlooked in a budget after all of your necessary expenses fluff like entertainment does n't count if your employer has a 401k with a match i would contribute to that up to the match amount   next i would save an emergency fund to cover unforseen events such as car repairs etc $ 1000 is not an uncommon amount to see people suggest for this next i would knock out your car loan then student loan as fast as possible this will free up some cash flow which gives you more freedom to do what you want at this point you save more so you do n't have to finance the next car or have a down payment for a home or whatever   building your savings to be 3 6 months of income is a good idea this covers things like being laid off or other larger unexpected events after you get to that point how you handle your budget is pretty open

if you have decided to do the degree and are simply deciding whether to accept employer funding for it or not take the funding i see no difference between my employer does n't pay my tuition and my employer paid my tuition but i had to pay it back because i moved on therefore there is no downside to letting them pay the tuition if you want to move on before the two years or whatever is up you pay back that interest free loan you are still ahead over self funding the degree if you have not decided to do the degree and are letting the employer funded tuition figure into your decision process stop that right now doing a degree is hard work you will either work much longer hours than you do now or live on a lower salary or more likely both you might enjoy it you might be worth more afterwards and it might open the door to a of careers available only to those with the degree the actual cost of the tuition is unlikely to be significant in this decision process removing it by assuming the employer pays it should still not be done if it 's worth doing when you self fund then do it and relax knowing you wo n't feel trapped at your employer even if you let them pay it or lend you the money for it if you end up leaving

a stop loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order this means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price for relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares to mitigate this brokers also offer a stop limit order where you set not only a trigger price but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares this reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices especially if you are selling a very large position however in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price for securities that are liquid and not very volatile either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses for securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market but you may end up stuck with shares you do n't want for longer than originally planned it 's up to you to decide which kind of risk you prefer

if you want the cheapest online broker in australia you ca n't go past cmc markets they charge $ 9.90 upto a $ 10,000 trade and 0.1 above that there is no ongoing fees unless you choose to have dynamic data stock prices get updated automatically as they change however the dynamic data fee does get waived if you have about 10 or more trades per month you do n't really need the dynamic data unless you are a regular trader anyway they also provide some good research tools and some basic charting your funds with them are kept in a account so are safe they do n't provide the best interest on funds kept in the account so it is best to just deposit the funds when you are looking to buy and move your funds earning higher interest when selling hopes this helps regards victor update they have now increased their basic brokerage to a minimum of $ 11 per trade unless you are a frequent trader

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

if you look at a trade grid you can see how this happens if there are enough bids to cover all shares currently on the sell side at a certain price those shares will be bought and increased price quotes will be shown for the bids and ask if there are enough bids to cover this price those will get bought and higher prices will be shown and this process will repeat until the sell side has more power than the buy side it seems like this process is going on all day long with momentum either on the upside or downside but i think that much of this bidding and selling is automatic and is being done by large trading firms and high tech computers i also feel that many of these bids and asks are already programmed to appear once there is a price change so once one price gets bought computers will put in higher bids to take over asks it 's like a virtual war between trading firms and their computers when more money is on the buy side the stock will go up and vice versa i sort of feel like this high frequency trading is detrimental to the markets and does n't really give everyone a fair shot retail investors do not have the resources and knowledge in order to do this sort of high frequency trading it also seems to go against certain free market principles in my opinion

a good quick filter to see if a property is worth looking at is if the total rent for the property for the year is equal to 10 of the price of the property   for example if the property is valued at $ 400,000 then the rent collected should be $ 40,000 for the entire year   which is $ per month if the property does not bring in at least 10 per year then it is not likely all the payments can be covered on the property   it 's more likely to be sinking money into it to keep it afloat you would be exactly right as you have to figure in insurance utilities taxes maintenance repair mortgage payments new roof new furnace etc paint etc also as a good rule of thumb expect a vacancy rate of at least 10 or 1 month per year as a precaution if you have money sitting around look into real estate investment trusts   iirc the average dividend was north of 10 last year   that is all money that comes back to you   i 'm not sure what the tax implications are in australia however in canada dividends are taxed very   no mortgage property tax tenants to find or maintenance either

what you did is called a strangle it 's rather unlikely that both will be exercised on the same day but yes it can happen   that is if the market is very volatile on a given day so that the stock hits 13 in the morning the put gets exercised and then hits 15 later in the day so the call gets exercised or vice versa more to the point the prices are close enough that one might be hit on one day and the other on a different day in either case if one side gets hit you need to reevaluate your position in the other but basically any open position you have can be hit at any time the only way to avoid this risk is not to have positions

us checking accounts are not really secure though many people use them one form of check fraud has been highlighted by prof donald and carried out by frank as portrayed in the film catch me if you can basically anyone can write a check that would draw from your account merely by knowing your account number and your bank 's aba routing number   with those two pieces of information which are revealed on every check that you write anyone can print a working check either using a laser printer with micr magnetic ink character recognition toner or by placing an order with a check printing company   the only other missing element is a signature which is a pretty weak form of authentication when presented with such a check your bank would probably honor it before finding out too late that it is fraudulent a variant of this vulnerability is ach funds transfers   this is the mechanism through which you could have say your utility company automatically withdraw money from your account to pay your bill   unfortunately the transfer is initiated by the recipient and the system relies largely on trust with some statistical monitoring for suspicious patterns basically the whole us checking system is built with convenience rather than security in mind since other institutions are able to initiate withdrawal transactions by knowing just the aba number and account number   in practice it works well enough for most people but if you are paranoid about security as you seem to be you do n't want to be using checks the european system which has largely eliminated checks in favor of payer initiated push transactions is safer by design

the credit card may have advantages in at least two cases in some instances at least in the us a merchant will put a hold on a credit card without charging it   this happens a lot at hotels for example which use the hold as collateral against damages and incidental charges   on a credit card this temporarily reduces your credit limit but never appears on your bill   i 've never tried to do it on a debit card but my understanding is that they either reject the debit card for this purpose or they actually make the withdrawal and then issue a refund later   you 'll actually need to account for this in your cash flow on the debit card but not on the credit card if you get a fraudulent charge on your credit card it impacts that account until you detect it and go through the fraud resolution process   on a debit card the fraudulent charge may ripple through the rest of your life   the rent payment that you made by electronic transfer or in the us by check for example is now rejected because your bank account is short by the amount of the fraud even if you did n't use the debit card to pay it   eventually this will probably get sorted out but it has potential to create a bigger mess than is necessary personally i never use my debit card i consider it too risky with no apparent benefit

is evaluating stocks just a loss of time if the stock is traded very much not at all making sound investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of companies will help you to do decide whether a given company is right for you and your risk appetite investing is not a zero sum game and you can achieve a positive long term or short term depending on what you 're after outcome for yourself without compromising your ability to sleep at night if you take the time to become acquainted with the companies that you are investing in how can you ensure that your evaluation is more precise than the    market ones which consists of the evaluation of thousands of people    and professionals for the average individual the answer is often simply you probably can not but you do n't have to set the bar that high what you can do is ensure that your evaluation gives you a better understanding of your investment and allows you to better align it with your investment objectives you do n't have to beat the professionals you just have to lose less money than you would by paying them to make the decision for you

did n't lose your job you just had temporary employment   same as back in the late 1990 's when unemployment was really low a lot of people got jobs they really were n't qualified for and were paid far more at least on a scale relative to their co workers than they were really worth   the sad thing about that is that they came to believe they were truly worth that amount of money   the same with houses   my home bought in late 2000 increased in estimated market value by 75 i.e. to 175 of it 's previous sale price when i bought it and the bubble around here was n't anything like it was in other regions of the us and of course now it has ostensibly sunk back down to very nearly the price i paid for it   the problem for a lot of people with that is that even if they did n't buy during the peak bubble years they refinanced or based on that higher estimated value and so ended up basically removing and then spending the lion 's share of equity that they had built up in their house   for others it was much the same as the late 90 's employment they came to believe that their house was worth more and they have difficulty letting go of that illusory estimated market price   so they are experiencing the wealth loss effect just as they once experienced a wealth effect   i was saved from those things because    a i realized that the price of houses is always at the margin and is never guaranteed by what the place cost or what you have invested in it or even what the owner or mortgage company thought it was worth rather when you go to sell it will be determined by what the want are capable of paying    b i was far more concerned with what my total cost of buying would be including all of the interest paid on the mortgage this led me to first of all only buy what i needed in a house i.e. single guy = small place and secondly to pay the whole thing off asap which i did dramatically lowering the total lifetime cost of the place    and finally and probably most importantly though in part due to b above   c it does n't really matter to me whether the price goes up or down because i know that i will always need a place to live and that generally speaking due to overall market conditions the prices of all houses will tend to go up down together and though not necessarily in lock step there are always factors of neighborhood local economy housing trends etc but still should i desire to move i will essentially be able to trade my house for a similar one in a similar market with only a small 6 to 10 cost   d but i also know that if i move up market attempt to move to an area house that has a relatively higher demand higher price that i will then have to pay more or get an even smaller place smaller home less land no garage shop etc yet conversely if i for some reason decide to move down market to an area house with a relatively lower demand price i may be able to either pay less or to get slightly more house additional land etc   note i also took into account demographic changes when i bought and think i made the right choice even though it has n't played out yet with the typical household actually becoming smaller single parents fewer kids more retirees wanting to downsize etc i figured way back in 2000 that in 15 20 30 years circa 2015 2045 the big would be aging and in huge oversupply whereas smaller homes would be in relatively higher demand and given things like smart growth planning probably in lesser supply and so would be more likely to retain value   again this has n't played out yet though there definitely are signs that it is starting but i am also really not interested in selling so it 's a moot point at present and even if i am proved wrong it will probably merely prove to be the loss of an upside and not an actual loss per se

if you have just started an ira presumably with a contribution for 2012   you likely have $ 5000 in it or $ 10,000 if you made a full contribution for   2013 as well at this time i would recommend putting it all in a   single low cost mutual fund typically mutual funds that track an index such as the s&p 500 index have lower costs annual expense fees than actively managed funds and most investment companies offer such mutual funds with fidelity vanguard schwab to name a few having very low expenses even among index funds later when you have more money in the account you can consider diversifying into more funds buying stocks and bonds investing in etfs etc incidentally if you are just starting out and your roth ira is essentially your first investment experience be aware that you do not need a brokerage account for your roth ira until you have more money in the account to invest and specifically want to buy individual stocks and bonds instead of just mutual funds if you opened a brokerage account for your roth ira close it and   transfer the roth ira to your choice of mutual fund company else you will be paying annual fees to the brokerage for maintaining your account inactivity fees since you wo n't be doing any trading etc the easiest way to do this is to go to the mutual fund company web site and tell them that you want to transfer your ira to them not roll over your ira to them and they will take care of all the paper work and collecting your money from the brokerage ditto if your roth ira is with a bank or another mutual fund company then close your brokerage account

years ago a coworker to me how his tax guy got him a huge refund i told him my goal was to owe a couple thousand dollars and that i 'm glad i did n't have his guy   in the end your return should reflect the truth and a good tax guy will be little better than good tax software the bottom line is that a refund is money you lend the government interest free if you can owe a bit of money but avoid paying a penalty you 'll have gotten a free loan from uncle sam   given the fact that most it seems that way someone tell me if i 'm wrong families carry some balance on their credit cards they are paying out 12 or more on their highest interest debt lending the government even $ 1000 for the year comes at a cost if you file in time to get your refund by the end of march that 's an average 9 months you are out your money is $ 90 scale that up to $ 3000 the average refund and the max 24 rate i 've seen $ 540 lost   better to adjust your withholding and get the extra money each paycheck to pay off other debt   obviously for those with no debt their cost is minimal perhaps 1 but still better in your pocket for the year   if you pay in this money every paycheck only to feel good getting it back every march or april while paying 18 card interest every month that 's your choice and will support that decision or so it seems   edit the article steve linked titled big tax refunds really are good ignores this debt only focusing on the near zero rate banks offer now the article listed 8 reasons the author felt this way by the way the author is the chief tax officer jackson tax service inc which makes him a bit less than a disinterested third party and all 8 of his reasons are far from compelling in my opinion getting a $ 3,000 check is never a bad thing this was 1 and by now you know why i disagree next more than 75 percent of all individual taxpayers get refunds year after year it has been this way for decades it is unlikely that 75 percent of all taxpayers are all making bad financial decisions every year that 's enough rhetorical nonsense read the rest for yourself and decide if the next 6 reasons are any more compelling   keep in mind sellers of tax software or services have backed themselves into a corner with the largest refund claims i 'm sympathetic to the fact that we 'll shoot for no refund at all in fact our goal is for you to owe just $ 100 will not be their next campaign    edit 2 i gave this more thought as i started to write a near 1000 word post on this topic i came to find that 1 in 4 employees did not deposit enough in their 401(k to capture the full match this is the highest lost opportunity as the potential return is an instant 100 for matched deposits again it 's easy to dismiss the near zero bank rates but that 's not the alternative best use for the money

in most markets there are fixed fees known as commissions for instance with a retail broker in the stock market you can expect every trade to cost you $ 7.00 as an example it is $ 7.00 regardless of if you place a trade for $ 25 or $ 25,000 you will see that just opening the trade with a smaller amount will eat up all of your profits and a majority of your capital but if you opened the trade with more capital through the investment group then the $ 7.00 commission will be much less of a tax on your trade basically the only advantage is that the tax of commissions will be less if you have a larger account if the commission is a fixed dollar value which is not always true either regardless at $ 25 per month not many markets will be accessible there is also the possible educational aspect of investing with a group of people or it can simply be ideals

i could be wrong but i doubt you 're going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one the problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house   so the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan and keep the loan to value ltv low enough that the bank is secured so say you currently owe $ 40k on your mortgage and you want to build a house that will be worth $ 200k in order to avoid pmi you 're going to have to have an ltv of 80 or less which means that you can spend no more than $ 160k to build the house   if you want to roll the existing loan in now you have to build for less than $ 120k and there 's no way that you can build a $ 200k house for $ 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible otherwise you 're going to have to make up the difference in cash when you tear down a house you are essentially throwing away the value of the house when you have a mortgage on the house you throw away that value plus you still owe the money which is a difficult hole to climb out of a better solution might be to try and sell the house as is perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash if that is not a viable option or you do n't want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen add on a room remodel bathrooms etc so it all depends on what the house is worth today as is how much it will cost you to rebuild and what the value of the new house will be

i think the advice bob is being given is good bob should n't sell his investments just because their price has gone down selling cheap is almost never a good idea in fact he should do the opposite when his investments become cheaper he should buy more of them or at least hold on to them always remember this rule buy low sell high this might sound illogical at first why would someone keep an investment that is losing value well the truth is that bob does n't lose or gain any money until he sells if he holds on to his investments eventually their value will raise again and offset any temporary losses but if he sells as soon as his investments go down he makes the temporary losses permanent if bob expects his investments to keep going down in the future naturally he feels tempted to sell them but a true investor does n't try to anticipate what the market will do trying to anticipate market fluctuations is speculating not investing quoting benjamin graham the most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock market movements the speculator 's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations the investor 's primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices market movements are important to him in a practical sense because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell assuming that the fund in question is well managed i would refrain from selling it until it goes up again

late to the party but it 's just improving your cost basis in a defined risk trade even further if you want to put up less risk capital but want to test the waters this can be one way to do it another could be buying cheap otm or financing a further otm option with the basis reduction from the debit spread if you want to gamble a bit further and venture into 15 20 delta positions usually i am doing debit spreads with a buying atm and selling a couple strikes further otm or at least at the most liquid strikes but if it 's a high flier it can be disappointing but a good trade if you 're more of a contrarian in where you buy your calls puts it 's absolutely a good way to lessen your risk on a calculated bet

accounts track value at any given time a given account will have a given value the type of account indicates what the value represents roughly on a balance sheet a listing of accounts and their values at a given point in time there is typically only one equity account representing net worth i do n't know much about gnucash though income and expenses accounts do not go on the balance sheet but to find out more either someone else or the gnucash manual will have to describe how they work in detail equity is more similar to a liability than to assets the equation assets = equity + liabilities should always hold you can think of assets as being what my stuff is worth and equity and liabilities together as being who owns it the part other people own is liability and the part you own is equity see balance sheet accounting equation and double entry bookkeeping for more information a corporate balance sheet might actually have more than one equity entry the purpose of the breakdown is to show how much of their net worth came from investors and how much was earned that 's only relevant if you 're trying to assess how a company has performed to date it 's not important for a family 's finances

high frequency trades are intra day the would buy a stock for 100 and sell for multiple times so if you start with 100 in your broker account you buy something it takes 2 3 days to settle you sell for it takes 2 3 days to settle you again buy something for 100 it is the net value of both buys and sells that you need to look at trading on margin accounts most brokers offer margin accounts the exact leverage ratios varies what this means is that if you start with 10 or 15 or 25 in your broker you can buy stock of 100 of course legally you wo nt own the stock unless you pay the broker balance etc

the advantage of using a mortgage is that you pay for a house at today 's price using tomorrow 's money your question suggests that you rightly observed that it was not a good idea around 2006 the last peak in housing that was when prices were at their maximum and had nowhere to go but down some experts think that house prices still have further to go on the downside meanwhile wages have been going nowhere during that time this phenomenon seems to happen about every 40 years or so the 1930s the 1970s and around 2010 at most other times say the 1980s houses are likely to go up for the foreseeable future at those times you want to buy the house at today 's price then pay for it in future dollars when you are earning more money the irony is that what most people observe as teenagers is usually the wrong thing to do when they are say forty in it will probably make sense to have a large mortgage in a bull housing market which is the opposite of what you observed around 2010 so a better rule is to do at age 40 what made sense about the time you were born in your case perhaps the 1990s whereas the people born in the early 1970s that got caught recently observed the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s in their teens and twenties rather than the bear market of the 1970s that took place about the time they were born

in a word no diversification is the first rule of investing   your plan has poor diversification because it ignores most of the economy large cap stocks   this means for the expected return your portfolio would get you would bear an unnecessarily large amount of risk   large cap and small cap stocks take turns outperforming each other   if you hold both you have a safer portfolio because one will perform well while the other performs poorly   you will also likely want some exposure to the bond market a simple and diversified portfolio would be a total market index fund and a total bond market fund   something like 60 in the equity and 40 in the bonds would be reasonable   you may also want international exposure and maybe exposure to real estate via a reit fund you have expressed some risk aversion in your post   the way to handle that is to take some of your money and keep it in your cash account and the rest into the diversified portfolio remember when people add more and more asset classes large cap international bonds etc they are not increasing the risk of their portfolio they are reducing it via diversification   the way to reduce it even more after you have diversified is to keep a larger proportion of it in a savings account or other guaranteed investment btw your p2p lender investment seems like a great idea to me but 60 of your money in it sounds like a lot

the stock should fall by approximately the amount of the dividend as that is what is paid out if you have a stock trading at $ 10/share and it pays a $ 1/share dividend the price should drop to $ 9 as what was trading before the dividend was paid would be both the dividend and the stock itself if the person bought just for the dividend then it would likely be neutral as there is n't anything extra to be gained consider if this was n't the case would n't one be able to buy a stock a few days before the dividend and sell just after for a nice profit that does n't make sense and is the reason for the drop in price similarly if a stock has a split or spin off there may be changes in the price to reflect that adjustment in value of the company if i give you 2 nickels for a dime the overall value is still 10 cents though this would be 2 coins instead of one some charts may show a dividend adjusted price to factor out these transactions so be careful of what prices are quoted

vat = value added tax as an aussie think gst this is applicable in britain basically if you were in britain and if you could claim vat as a deduction that invoice is not sufficient proof to make the claim but you 're in oz so it does n't apply to you in any case for work related deductions like book purchases see   issues such as the books being second hand or purchased online are not cited in the instructions as relevant limiting factors in fact if you really want to get into the nitty gritty you could claim the work related proportion of your internet access fees as a deduction question instructions above cover that as well

nowadays some banks in some countries offer things like temporary virtual cards for online payments they are issued either free of charge or at a negligible charge immediately via bank 's web interface access to which might either be free or not this varies you get a separate account for the newly issued card the card being just a set of numbers you transfer some money there same web interface you use it to make payment(s you leave $ 0 on that card and within a day or a month it expires somewhat convenient and your possible loss is limited tightly check if your local banks offer this kind of service

there may be a third option the bank gives you the first mortgage of 80 and a second maybe a heloc for that missing 5 this way you get the lower rate and the money they 'd charge you for pmi goes to paying down the second loan   alternately do you have any other sources to tap to bridge this small gap a 401(k loan perhaps the rate low and for home purchase a 10 yr payback if these are n't viable options i agree that taking the pmi route while tracking the balance is the way to go

keep in mind that by fully paying off one of your loans you will reduce your minimum repayments this will make you feel richer than you actually are this will make you buy stuff that it seems like you can afford probably putting some of it on credit as you ca n't actually afford this this will leave you in a years time with the same amount of debt you have now or more but with a slightly bigger tv assuming your home loan has no penalties for paying off extra then put all 11k into there to keep your monthly repayments as high as possible

cash back from credit cards is handled separately than the rest of the purchase i.e. interest begins accumulating on that day and likely at a higher rate and usually comes out of a lower limit than the credit allotted to that card given all these differences and the obvious revenue generation situation for the lender it makes sense for them to give the store an incentive rather than penalize them further for the use of such a feature   note i am not privy to the inner workings or agreements between large stores and credit lenders so i can not guarantee any of this

there should be no problem getting a mortgage from a bank with 3 years in business they are going to use the average of the last 2 years of taxable profits to determine your income though i think the key words here are taxable profits and this is where the problem typically comes in for most self employed folks many times self employed people will have soft losses and deductions that make their income seem lower than it really is or unreported income   it has nothing to do with your business plan or your relationship with the bank unless it is a small community bank or credit union

not at all impossible what you need is fundamental analysis and relationship with your investment if you are just buying shares not sure you can have those i will provide examples from my personal experience   my mother has barely high school education when she saw house and land prices in bulgaria she thought it 's impossibly cheap we lived on rent in israel our horrible apartment was worth $ 1 m and it was horrible we could never imagine buying it because we were middle class at best my mother insisted that we all sell whatever we have and buy land and houses in bulgaria one house for example went from $ 20k to between 2001 and 2007 but we knew bulgaria we knew how to buy we knew lawyers we knew builders   the company i currently work for when i joined share prices were around 240 2006 they are now 2015 at 1500 i did n't buy because i was repaying mortgage at 5 i am very sorry i did n't everybody knew 240 is not a real share price for our company an established + 30 years software company with piles of cash we were not a hot startup outsiders did n't invest many developers and finance people who work in the company made a fortune again relationship knowledge   i bought a house in the uk in 2012 everyone knew house prices were about to go up i was lucky i had a friend who was a he told me buy now or lose money i bought a little house for 200k it is now worth not double but pretty good money   my point is take your investment personally do n't just dump money into something once you are an insider your risk will be almost mitigated and you could buy where you see an opportunity and sell when you feel you are near the maximal real worth of your investment it 's not hard to analyse it 's hard to make a commitment

japan has entered the next phase unlimited money printing   investors have been watching japan for over a decade now wondering what happens to a country that has a debt to gdp ratio of big   to realistically pay off we are starting to get the answer for review japan was the first country in the modern central banking era to begin a policy of   quantitative easing an unconventional form of monetary policy that is used when interest rates have already been lowered to the zero bound quantitative easing which involves the purchase of printed money to buy government bonds was widely viewed in japan as a failure but what most people do n't understand about japan 's early qe experiments is that they were very small less than $ 20 billion a month it took prime minister abe and boj governor   to ramp up asset purchases significantly in what was called      abe japan 's prime minister photographer bloomberg      the results of have been mixed but the stock market is certainly higher and the yen is certainly lower although it 's not clear that either of those two developments have really helped japan 's stock market is mostly foreign owned and the weaker yen did n't materially help the balance of trade still there are a lot of people who said that japan 's endless debt deflation would have been worse   without so it has remained firmly in place for five years   rapidly began to cause distortions as accelerated asset purchases caused the bank of japan to hold a huge percentage of outstanding government bonds at 40 and rising as well as being the majority holder of index etfs investors who traffic in have remarked that the market now functions very poorly since so much of the market is held by the boj it seems that will get worse not better last year the boj implemented a policy of yield curve targeting ostensibly to help the banks keeping the overnight rate negative but targeting a 10 year rate at zero percent the boj has been buying longer dated bonds for years but this was the first time it ever explicitly capped a rate at longer maturities some people wondered how committed the boj would be to maintain that cap in the event that were caught up in a global duration selloff which we experienced in the last two weeks   as 10-year yields rose above 0.10 last week the boj announced that it was prepared to buy an   unlimited amount of bonds to keep yields close to zero percent as you can imagine buying an unlimited amount of 10-year involves printing a theoretically unlimited amount of yen so the yen weakened significantly on the news   it still remains about ten percent stronger than it was in 2015 we are getting closer to the endgame for japan what happens if yields rise further what happens if the yen depreciates significantly how much could it depreciate could japan have a currency crisis what happens if the boj ends up owning the entire bond market these are the questions that investors are asking and nobody really knows the answers we are in territory i believe that a currency crisis is n't just possible it 's inevitable and it probably happens at about the time that the boj owns all or nearly all of the market and has to resort to   canceling the debt this sounds like a neat magic trick to make the debt go away but the laws of economics are not to be conned anything is possible a currency crash a bond market crash anything this is the very definition of debt monetization that resulted in hyperinflation in places like weimar germany and zimbabwe is japan different we shall see we will find out soon as japan has taken a major step in that direction   is the   author of all the evil of this world and the editor of the 10th man newsletter for economics subscribe here   forbes articles have 8 tracking cookies and 9 tracking scripts this comment has r

you pay tax on the entire amount not just the capital gains    when cashing out such a plan you would pay the top marginal tax rate on the full amount plus another 10 in penalties   it is very likely that the additional income of the balance withdrawal will increase your top marginal rate    it is impossible to come up with a precise answer as we do n't know the following however you can take a concept away from this that is important   you will be taxed and penalized on the entire 401 k balance not just the capital gain    in the best case scenario that is you had little or no income in a given year   under current tax law you would owe about 31 of your 401 k balance in taxes   as this is such an inefficient use of money most authors recommend against it except in the case of extreme circumstances

if both cards have the same interest rate there 's likely no practical difference here very likely the required minimum payment is calculated the same on both cards pay off one card and put the rest on the other or split the payment across both cards my personal preference would be to entirely pay off one card and put the rest on the other it feels like a bigger accomplishment if one card has a significantly different interest rate obviously you 'd try to pay that one down first alternatively if you owe less on one card you may choose to pay that off and then cut up the card if you are trying to recover from a poor financial situation this way you have achieved a specific goal but again in your case it sounds like your two cards are entirely interchangeable either way you do it well done on putting your money where it 'll make the most difference right now

inflation and stock returns are completely different things the cpi tracks the changes in the prices of a basket of goods a consumer might buy the s&p 500 tracks the returns earned by investors in the equity of large companies   the two are very different things and not closely linked example a world without inflation consider a world in which there was no inflation   prices are fixed   should stocks return zero   certainly not   companies take raw materials and produce goods and services that have value greater than that of the raw materials   they create new wealth   this wealth becomes profit for the company which then is passed on to the owners of the company equityholders either in the form of dividends or more commonly price increases example a world with no inflation and no economic growth note that i have not implied above that companies have to grow in order for returns to outperform inflation   total stock returns depend on the current and expected profit of the firm   firms can remain the same size and continually kick out profits   total returns will be positive in this environment even if there is no growth and no inflation   if the firms pay the money out as dividends investors get a cash flow   if they retain these earnings the value of the firm 's equity increases   total returns take both types of income into account   technically the s&p 500 is not a total return index but in our current legal and corporate culture environment there is a preference for retaining profits rather than paying them out   this causes price increases risk bearing in principle if profit was assured then investors would bid up stock prices so high that profit would have to compete with the risk free rate which often is close to inflation like right now   however profit is not assured   firm profit swings around over time and constitutes a significant source of risk   we can think of the owners of the firm as being the bondholders and equityholders   these assets are structured such that almost all the profit risk is born by equityholders   we can therefore think of equityholders as being compensated for bearing the risk that would otherwise   be born by bondholders   because equityholders are bearing risk stock prices must be low enough that stocks have a positive expected return above the risk free rate which is presumably not significantly below inflation   this is true for the same reason that insurance premiums are positive people have to be compensated for bearing risk see my answer to this question for a discussion of why risk means we should expect stock prices to increase indefinitely even if inflation the s&p is not a measure of firm size or value the s&p measures the return earned by investors not the size of us companies   true if constituent companies grow and nothing else changes the index goes up but if a company shrinks a lot it gets dropped out rather than dragging the index down by the way please note that dollars put into equities are not stuck somewhere   they are passed on to the seller who then uses it to buy something even if this is a new equity issuance and the seller is the firm itself   the logic that growth of firms somehow sucks money out of usage is incorrect

if you buy a townhouse you often are in a condominium arrangement in the us when you 're really in a in particular   so that 's a downside right away you have to have a hoa or at least some sort of common agreement though it might not have formal meetings   everyone who owns an interest in the entire group of townhouses gets some say in landscaping and such beyond that though townhouses and similarly are often easier to own as they do n't have as much maintenance that you have to do but more expensive because you pay someone to do it the landscaping the external repairs etc   you likely do n't have as much control over what the external looks like because you have to be in agreement with the other owners but you also do n't have to do the work unless your agreement is to collectively do the mowing landscaping which you should know in advance    i would n't underestimate the value of easier by the way it 's very valuable to not have to deal with as many repairs and to be able to go a week without thinking about mowing or watering   in that sense it can be a nice transition into ownership getting some but not all of the obligations   but if that 's something you really value doing the landscaping and mowing and whatnot that 's relevant too   you can always tell your realtor to look for townhouses where the owners do some all of the landscaping though that opens up a different can of worms where you rely on others to do work that they may not do or do well they 're also somewhat you may be sharing a wall but not necessarily air gap townhouses do exist and either way will be closer to your neighbors   does noise bother you   conversely are you noisy   in a college town this is probably something to pay attention to price wise of course stay well within your means if being close to the city center is important that may lead you to buy a townhouse in that area   if being further out is n't a problem you 'll probably have similar choices in terms of price as long as you look in cheaper areas for single family homes

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

there are a few main economic reasons given why investors show a strong home bias interestingly though if you ask investors about the future of their home country compared with other countries they will generally though not always significantly overestimate the future of their own country   it is difficult to definitively say what drives investors but this psychological home bias could be one of the larger factors edit in response to the bounty maybe this vanguard article on their recommended international exposure is what you are looking for though they only briefly speculate about why people so consistently show a home bias in investing   the wikipedia article mentioned above has some very good references and while there may be no complete answer with the certainty that you seek as there are as many reasons as there are investors a combination of the above list seems to capture much of what is going on across different countries

there is no zero risk option there is no safe parking zone for turbulent times there is no such thing as a zero risk investment   you would do well to get this out of your head now   cash though it will retain its principle over time will always be subject to inflation risk assuming a positive inflation environment which historically in the us anyway has always been the case since the great depression but i could n't find a pure cash no investment option what i mean by this is an option where my money is kept idle without investing in any kind of financial instrument stocks bonds other currencies forex etc etc whatever   getting back to the real crux of your question several other answers have already highlighted that you 're looking for a money market fund   these will likely be as close to cash as you will get in a retirement account for the reasons listed in 's answer investing in short term notes would also be another relatively low risk alternative to a money market fund   again this is low risk not no risk i wanted such kinda option because things may turn bad and i may want nothing invested in the stock markets bond markets i was thinking that if the market turns bear then i would move everything to cash unless you have a the innate ability to perfectly time the market you are better off keeping your investments where they are and riding out the bear market   cash does not generate dividends most funds in a retirement account do   sure you may have a paper loss of principle in a bear market but this will go away once the market turns bull again   assuming you have a fairly long time before you retire this should not concern you in the slightest again i want to stress that market timing does not work   even the professionals who get paid the big bucks to do this on average get it right as often as they get it wrong   if you had this ability you would not be asking financial questions on stack exchange i can tell you that i would recommend you read the four pillars of investing by william bernstein   he has a very no nonsense approach to investing and retirement that would serve you or anybody well in turbulent financial markets   his discussion on risk is especially applicable to your situation

in addition to the issues discussed in 's answer i think you need to consider your medium term saving needs and existing savings in particular do you have a sufficient rainy day fund a fund you will spend if things go wrong for example if you are dependent on a vehicle that is not covered by a guarantee or service plan you should have enough money saved for a couple of major repairs depending on how secure your job is whether it carries sick leave and long term disability and how easy or difficult it would be to find another job in the event e.g. of your employer going bankrupt due to a downturn in your industry you should have months to years of minimal living expenses in your rainy day fund if you do n't have those things covered you should urgently save as much as you can until they are covered if you do then the next savings priority is to put money by for retirement of course if all goes well the rainy day fund will ultimately get folded into retirement but it needs to exist now in a form you can access quickly

there will quickly come a time when buying to rebalance is impractical consider you save 10 and at some point you have 5x your income saved you earn $ 50 k and have accumulated $ 250 k a simple allocation 50/50 so $ 125 k stock $ 125 k bonds now in a year the market is up much over 4 your $ 5 k deposit will not be enough to balance earlier on the method may work just fine later on not so much edit the above is an example to show that there will come a time when deposits are not enough to rebalance the above single year produces a split and the rebalance deposits more than 2 years if the market continues to rise a reasonable amount 2 years later you are even more out of balance perhaps   i chose reasonable numbers as a starting point just 5x income saved and a 10 annual deposit in the end you can waive off any divergence from your target that 's your choice

quite a lot changed since back then so i consider it highly unlikely that you could point to one single cause you can think about it more clearly when you remove money from the equation know that money is only an intermediary in the exchange of goods and it is in fact the exchanged goods that matter so to your question you produce some goods and exchange them for the goods you consume the amount of goods that you can exchange what you produced for determines your quality of life so what parts could change   1 you could actually produce less the increase in productivity is really hard to accurately measure because even if you know for a fact that one worker 's increased when buying a machine maybe that comes at a cost of less productivity in other areas   2 not everything that you pay for does actually increase your quality of life for example speeding tickets do n't other stuff might increase your quality of life but in a manner that you do n't easily recognize for example more prisoners that you pay for might reduce your chance of being mugged however if you 're not being mugged on a regular basis you would n't notice   3 other people get a higher percentage most countries tax rates rise with rising income so when the currency is being devalued tax rates rise relative to your purchasing power in addition to other taxes and fees that might be introduced or increased but even without government your bosses might simply take a bigger cut of the company 's earnings   4 we might produce the wrong stuff if more stuff gets produced that you do not want the production of the stuff you do want will decline even if total productivity is increased   and that is only what i can think of from the top of my head you will probably find that all of those happen and most likely other causes as well

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

the second part of your question is the easiest to answer how much manual work is involved in settlement processes payment systems which handle low value i.e. high volume transactions work on the basis of net settlement each of the individual payments are netted across all of the participant banks so that only one real payment is made by each bank some days banks will receive money others they will pay money this is arbitrary and depends on whether their outbound payments exceed their inbound payments for that day    the payment system will notify each bank how much it owes will receive for the day the money is then transferred between all of the banks simultaneously by the payment system to remove the risk that some pay and others do n't if you 're going to make or receive a very large payment you 're going to want to make certain that its correct this means that if there 's a discrepancy you need operations people available to find out why its wrong    when dealing with this many payments answering that question can be hard did we miss a payment is there a duplicate etc   the vast majority of payments will process without any human involvement but to make the process work you always need human brains there to fix problems that occur this brings me to your first question on every day that settlement happens a bank will receive or pay a very large sum of money as a settlement bank you must settle that money the guarantee that every bank will pay is one of the main reasons these systems exist for settlement to happen every bank has to agree to participate and be ready to verify the data on their side and deliver the funds from their account so there is no particular reason that this does n't happen on weekends and holidays other than history but for any payment system to change it would require the support of at least a majority of participants to pay staff to manage the settlement process on weekends this would increase costs for banks but the benefits would only really be for you and me if at all that means it 's unlikely to happen unless a government forces the issue

anthony russell i agree with johnfx petroleum is used in making many things such as asphalt road oil plastic jet fuel etc it 's also used in some forms of electricity generation and some electric cars use gasoline as a backup form of energy petrol is also used in electricity generation outside of cars source can be found here but to answer your question of why shares of electric car companies are not always negatively related to one another deals with supply and demand if investors feel positively about petroleum and petroleum related prospects then they are going to buy or attempt to buy shares of x petrol company this will cause the price of x petrol company to rise ceteris paribus just because the price of petroleum is high does n't mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company petrol prices could be high but numerous electric car companies could be doing poorly now with that being said you could argue that sales of electric cars may go up when petrol prices are high but there are numerous factors that come into play here i think it would be a good idea to do some more research if you are planning on investing also remember after a company goes public they no longer set the price of the shares of their stock the price of company x shares are determined by supply and demand which is inherently determined by investors attitudes and expectations ultimately defined by past company performance expectations of future performance earnings etc it could be that when the market is doing well it 's a good sign of other macroeconomic variables employment gdp incomes etc and all these factors power how often individuals travel vacation etc it also has to deal with the economy of the country producing the oil when you have opec countries selling petrol to the u.s. it is likely much cheaper per barrel than domestic produced and refined petrol because of the labor laws etc so a strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market but it 's not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy i think this is a great research topic that can not be answered in one post check this article here from here you can track down what research the fed of cleveland has done concerning this my advice to you is to not believe everything your peers tell you but to research everything your peers tell you with just a few clicks you can figure out the legitimacy of many things to at least some degree

despite buffett 's nearly perfect consistent advice over the past few decades they do n't reflect his earliest days   his modern philosophy seemed to in the 1970s you can see that buffett 's earliest days grew faster at for those partners willing to take on leverage with buffett than the last half century at not only is buffett limited by size as its quite difficult to squeeze one half trillion usd into sub billion usd investments but the economy thus market is far different than it was before the 1980s   he would have to acquire at least 500 billion usd companies outright and there simply are n't that many available that satisfy all of his modern conditions the market is much different now than it was when he first started at graham because before the 1960s the economy thus market would collapse and rebound about every few years   this sort of variance can actually help a value investor because a true value investor will abandon investments when valuations are high and go all in when valuations are low   the most extreme example was when he tried to as quietly as possible buy up an insurance company selling for something like a p e of 1 during one of the collapses   these kinds of opportunities are seldom available anymore not even during the 2009 collapse as he became larger those investments became off limits because it simply was n't worth his time to find such a high if it 's only a bare fraction of his wealth   also he started to deviate from benjamin graham 's methods and started to incorporate philip fisher 's by the 1970s his investment philosophy was more or less   he tried to balance graham 's avarice for price with fisher 's for value all of the commentary that special tax or cheap financing are central to his returns are false   they contributed but they are ancillary as one can see by comparing the limited vs general partners leverage helps enormously but this is still a tangent buffett has undoubtedly built his wealth from the nature of his investments   the exact blueprint can be constructed by reading every word he has published and any quotes he has not   simply he buys the highest quality companies in terms of risk adjusted growth at the best available prices   quantitatively it is a simple strategy to replicate   nflx was selling very cheaply during the sells frequently at low valuations up and coming retailers frequently sell at low valuations etc the key to buffett 's method is emotional control and removing the mental block that price equals value price is cost value is revenue and that concept is the hardest for most to   quoting from the first link one here it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately to people or it does n't take at all it 's like an if it does n't grab a person right away i find that you can talk to him for years and show him records and it does n't make any difference they just do n't seem able to grasp the concept simple as it is a fellow like rick who had no formal education in business understands immediately the value approach to investing and he 's applying it five minutes later i 've never seen anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten year period to this approach it does n't seem to be a matter of iq or academic training it 's instant recognition or it is nothing and i 'm convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market these graham and investors have successfully exploited gaps between price and value when the price of a stock can be influenced by a herd on wall street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person or the person or the most depressed person it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally in fact market prices are frequently nonsensical and finally   success in investing does n’t correlate with once you ’re above the level of 25 once you have ordinary intelligence what you need is the temperament to control the that get other people into trouble in investing there is almost no information on any who has helped buffett internally or even managed berkshire 's investments aside from louis simpson it is unlikely that buffett has allowed anyone to manage much of berkshire 's investments considering the consistent stream of commentary from him claiming that he nearly does nothing except read annual reports all day to the extent that he may have neglected his family to some degree and that listening to others will more likely hurt performance than help with the most striking example being his father 's recommendation that he not open a hedge fund after retiring from graham because he believed the market was topping and he absolutely his father

gt there may not be anything shameful about doing that but that scenario is indeed a business people do not shutter a profitable successful business and then go to work for someone else   not necessarily   it may very well be a planned exit not all businesses will nor should they be expected to or planned to endure into perpetuity just because the corporate charter sets no specific limit to the duration of the corporate entity does not mean that it is and certainly not that it needs to be   and a business that may be quite profitable to run even if it 's final pre closing year is less so is not necessarily a failure in fact closing an operation down while it is still slightly profitable and before it begins losing money and/or selling it 's assets off while they still have substantial investment value may in fact be the wisest move especially financially speaking which counts as anything but a failure   plus there are several industries where a temporary existence of a firm is recognized as a positive thing take films as an example a new company with a pre planned limited lifespan will often be formed to craft and produce the film and cease to exist once that task has been completed   and i think the hand wringing about restaurants is especially if ever there was is a business niche that was subject to fad amp fashion and the even nature of people 's tastes it would be the boutique segment of the restaurant industry even the ones or chains that do manage to survive often do so by dramatically changing their menus brand amp character so that a decade later they barely resemble their former selves   sure there are also other segments of the industry that are generally stable but many of them tend to be slow or no growth as well   gt;i believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self employed and business owners in the same breath someone who 's self employed basically owns a job his income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself    it covers an entire spectrum and the lines are rather fuzzy   yes a lot of self employed people whether configured as sole proprietorships partnerships llc 's or full corporations are by intent and probably always will be simply job replacement businesses and again there is nothing wrong with that whether they endure for a year 5 years 10 years or an entire lifetime how or why people have come to view this as somehow of less merit than someone being gainfully employed for someone else has always puzzled me   but some of those just as some of the part time or on the side businesses can take on an unexpected unplanned life of their own and grow into substantial enterprises that employ hundreds and even thousands of people over multiple decades after the fact the owners will often at least publicly claim that it was all part of the plan but in several cases where i know the founder owner personally i know from private conversation that that simply was n't the case   gt;a business owner on the other hand has processes equipment staff ip in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning   you are speaking of someone who has achieved a certain level of success and a certain size of operations   gt;these are different people with different goals and can not be lumped into the same demographic block   any and all blocks are going to be subjective and in a very real sense the dividing lines placed at rather arbitrary segments a particular named block will be very true from one point of view with lots of things that correlate and appear to be uniformly applicable and yet fallacious from another where there is again a whole spectrum of distinctions

kentucky property tax is assessed as of the owner on january 1 of each calendar year   in april you should be notified of what ky considers you to owe them and you have a two week period in may to appeal those decisions though it appears that you can only appeal real property tax assessments   the final tax bill is then sent to you in the fall by october and you have until the end of the year to pay the bill see kentucky property tax calendar overview for more details thus if you owned the car on jan 1 2016 then you should owe personal property tax on it for 2016 due in the fall   you may not have owed the tax paid in november if it was indeed personal property tax unless the seller was asking you to them for the tax they paid in 2015 note that property tax is separate and distinct from usage tax the 6 tax for vehicles paid at purchase date once and only once

the uptick rule is gone but it was in 2010 applied to all publicly traded equities under the terms of the rule a circuit breaker would be triggered if a stock falls by 10 or more in a single day at that point short selling would only be allowed if the price is above the current national best bid a restriction that would apply for the rest of the day and the whole of the following day derivatives are not yet restricted in such ways because of their nature requiring a short to increase supply however this latest rule widens options spreads during collapses because the exemption for hedging is now gone and what 's more a tool used by options market makers shorting the underlying to offset positive delta now has to go to the back of the selling line during a panic bonds are not restricted because for one there is n't much interest in shorting because bonds usually do n't have enough variance to exceed the cost of borrowing and many do not trade frequently enough because even the cost to trade bonds is expensive so arranging a short in its entirety will be expensive   the preferred method to short a bond is with swaps swaptions etc

assuming my math is correct and that i 'm not missing something about roth investments it appears to me that either option will work out exactly the same if you will be in the same tax bracket in retirement this is true only if your average tax rate in retirement is the same as your current marginal rate i 'm surprised none of the answers mention this since it is the crux of your question   if you can deduct an ira against your income taxes it is almost always better option than the roth equivalent marginal rates should not be compared to average rates or you will form all sorts of inaccurate conclusions if you are in a lower tax rate in retirement traditional is better really means if your average tax rate in retirement is lower than your current marginal rate traditional is better which for the overwhelming majority of americans is the case consider the following let 's say your intend to contribute $ 1000 in one year making $ 2k and withdraw it the next that is your only income in that year your tax brackets look like this is quite simplified but for this purpose will illustrate precisely why comparisons like you are making are very misleading in this case you can put $ 1000 in and pay no income tax at all because you deduct it you then withdraw $ 1000 the next year the first $ 500 you withdraw you pay no taxes on and the next $ 500 has a tax rate of 15 for a total tax of of $ 75 however this is a tax against your entire withdrawal of $ 1000 so your average tax rate this is important average is different than marginal is only 7.5 and you are left with $ in this case you can only contribute $ 850 to the ira because you are taxed against the money at your marginal rate 15 when you withdraw it you do n't pay any taxes and are left with the entire $ 850 $ 850 this is less than the above because you are taxed the whole amount at your previous marginal rate if however your tax rate in retirement was 30 for everything above $ 500 only then are the two scenarios equal your marginal tax rate in retirement has to be very high relative to your current tax rate for the roth to ever catch up and be better if you are able to deduct an ira contribution it will almost always be the best option the average federal income tax rate on middle class families has not changed dramatically enough over the past 50 years to be above normal marginal tax rates even at the 15 federal tax bracket your marginal rate is still higher than the highest average tax rate for the past 50 years by at least 3 and normally significantly so the reason i make this point about middle class marginal rates is that the majority of taxes might be higher in retirement is very unlikely to be the case in a meaningful way given the past 50 years however if you are in the top tax rate you are paying historic low tax rates by a factor of nearly 3 but also observe you ca n't do either ira since you must make $ 400k year the difference for middle class is no where near as noticeable keep in mind if you ca n't deduct there is no reason to not contribute to the roth there are other factors contributing to the traditional roth decision this answer only addresses the specifics in your question

chris you realize that when you buy a stock the seller gets the money not the company itself unless of course you bought ipo shares and the amount you 'd own would be such a small portion of the company they do n't know you exist   as far as morals go if you wish to avoid certain stocks for this reason look at the socially responsible funds that are out there there are also funds that are targeted to certain religions and avoid alcohol and tobacco the other choice is to invest in individual stocks which for the small investor is very tough and expensive you 'll spend more money to avoid the shares than these very shares are worth   your proposal is interesting but impractical in a portfolio of say $ 100 k in the s&p the bottom 400 stocks are disproportionately smaller amounts of money in those shares than the top 100 so we 're talking $ 100 or less you 'd need to short 2 or 3 shares even at $ 1 m in that fund 20 30 shares shorted is pretty silly no offense   why not do the math and during the year you purchase the fund donate the amount you own in the bad companies to charity   and what littleadv said that too

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

if some one ever offers high returns and low risk they are either extremely stupid or scamming you if they did find a high return low risk investment a smart person would buy it then it as a low return low risk investment and then sell it to you people would still buy and they would make a ton    either they are lying scam or a as bad

i think you are asking a few questions here why is gold chosen as money in a free market there are five characteristics of a good money gold and silver meet all five characteristics   diamonds are not easily divisible which is why they are not normally used as money   copper iron and lead are not scarce enough you would need a lot of these metals to make weekly or daily purchases   paper is also way too plentiful to be used as money by the way historically silver has been used for money more than gold how does international trade work with gold as money is this what you are asking with your hypothetical example of 10 countries each with y amount of gold typically a government will issue a currency that is backed by gold   this means you can redeem your currency for actual gold   then when an american spends 5 us dollars usd to purchase a chinese good the chinese man now owns 5   the chinese man can either redeem the 5 usd for gold or spend the 5 usd in the us   if a government issues more currency then they have gold for then the gold will start to flow from that country to other countries as the citizens of the other countries redeem the over issued currency for gold   this outflow of gold restricts governments from over issuing paper currency who creates the procedures and who them in modern worldwide economy the federal reserve imf and bank of international settlements all are involved in the current system where the us dollar see bretton woods agreement is the reserve currency used by central banks throughout the world   some think this system is coming to an end   i tend to agree

first of all just for the sake of clarity the federal reserve does n't actually print money that 's the job of the what they do is they buy us treasury bonds i.e. loan money to the us government the money they do it with are created from thin air just by adding some numbers in certain accounts thus it is described as printing money the us government then spends the money however it wishes to the idea is that this money is injected into the economy since the only way the us government can use the money from these loans is to spend them on buying something or give it to some people that would spend them   as it is a loan sometime in the future the us government would pay these loans back and in this moment the fed would decide if they want to contract the supply of money back they just destroy the money they 've got by the numbers they created before they could also do it by selling the bonds they hold on the open market and then again destroy the money they got as proceeds thus lowering the amount of money existing in the economy this way the fed can control how much money is out there and thus supposedly influence inflation and economic activity   the fed could also inject money in the economy by buying any assets after creating the money for example right now they own about a trillion dollars worth of various mortgage based securities but since buying specific security would probably give unfair advantage to the issuers and owners of this security usually us treasury bonds if what they buy the side effect of increased supply of money denominated in dollars would be as you noted devaluation of dollars compared to other currencies

a firm is a separate legal person from its shareholders or owners but does n't get invited to parties much owners invest capital to get shares in the firm or may get shares for investing time effort etc but those shares are on a limited liability basis that means that shareholders are only liable up to the value of their shares and that the firm itself is responsible for any expenses or liabilities the firm will have working capital from its initial investors i.e. any capital invested to get shares and can borrow money on the bond market or issue new shares to cover outgoings share ownership simply entitles the owner to a proportion of the residual equity of the company and voting rights for non equity in a firm that i previously worked for for example one of the partners owned 51 of the firm but put up 100 of the firm 's equity capital the other partner owned 49 and provided 90 of the intellectual capital of the firm they both took decisions equally the distribution of ownership should therefore have no bearing on who finances deals the owners or managers in larger firms should decide together how to use the company 's capital for spending because it is exactly that the company 's capital not any one of the investor 's limited liability of owners is one of the major benefits of forming a company

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

of course there can always be some ways you can integrate some amounts of social responsibility into product but i do n't think that 's the point he 's making social responsibility would be called business best practice if it improved the bottom line it is inevitable that there are times when social responsibility and business goals diverge and at that point given two companies that are in the same market space the one who bets against society will win this is the sort of thing that must be handled in law and absolutely can not be handled by allowing the free market to work because the free market will not discover ethics it will discover that ethics do n't matter in an environment that does n't require them     it 's the reason any claim that business does best when there are no regulations is absolutely false if a company can make more by polluting and you do n't have regulation that says clearly it may cost more but we require you to compete by also being non then you should expect the market to converge on pollution as best practice   removing regulation wo n't allow business to sort this out it will allow business to not care that they are polluting   there is the notion of a b corp that is organized for the purpose of trying to be good guys without being sued but it does n't assure that they will have a fair stake int he market   it just allows them to fail without getting sued by stock holders   basically if everyone is not required to be that level of good guy though b corps are basically indulging unilateral sure they can make a case that ethics matter and that might work but they do n't need b corp protection for that if making the case that ethics matter was going to win in the market any corporation could do it   for more thoughts so i do n't have to drone on here see my articles fiduciary duty vs. the three laws of duty vs three laws of and losing the war in a quiet war in quiet

there are many flaws with your idea say i want to borrow $ to accrue interest on a 1.20 apy    account i promise that i can not withdraw nor touch the    account by legal contract if you break the contract and lose the money the lender is out the money they can take you to court and will win but if you do n't have the money then they do n't get paid you ca n't squeeze water out of a rock even if a judge orders you to by sharing the interest with me on a loan they keep a percentage that they 'd normally get if you 're investing the money at 1.2 and the lender gets some amount less than that then they are getting much less than they normally get lenders typically get somewhere from 5 15 on loans the money can also be used to fund a stock trading account regardless of whether i profit i pay interest on the loan and split the profit shares 24/7 how can the lender lose with legal enforcing again if you lose the money no amount of legal enforcing can force you to pay money that you do n't have even if you go to jail for fraud the lender still does n't get paid simply no bank would ever agree to this

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

if you are buying and selling mutual funds in the same family of funds e.g. vanguard then you can set up an on line account on the vanguard website and it is easy vanguard offers a transaction service that allows you to sell shares of vfinx say and buy shares of say from the proceeds of the sale all in one swell but if you are holding the vfinx shares through your on line account with say etrade then it depends on what services etrade provides to you will it allow doing all that in one transaction or will it wait for the cash to come from vanguard and then send the money back to vanguard to invest in in any case selling vfinx shares and investing the proceeds in shares say   can not be done on the vanguard site only vanguard will send the proceeds of the sale of the vfinx shares only to your bank account not anywhere else you   then need to tell t. rowe price where you presumably have an account already that you want to invest $ x in shares and to withdraw the cash from your bank account if you are doing it all through etrade then the money from the sale of vfinx goes from vanguard to etrade into something called a sweep account or maybe your cash account at etrade and you invest it in after appropriate delays in receiving the money from vanguard into etrade etc if your cash account bank or etrade has enough of a balance you could sell vfinx and buy on the same day where the purchase is made from the money in the cash account and replaced a few days later by the proceeds from vanguard bouncing of checks or inability to act on a hot tip to invest in something in the interim is your problem not the bank 's or etrade 's

say there are 5 people took loan of $ 100000 each those 5 people work in different jobs and have different capacity to payoff loan someone earning $ 40000 a year has higher risk to default on their payment then someone making $ a year    as bank wants to sell this cdo to investor but how would investor know what the risk factor for this cdo is this is where rating agency comes in picture they apparently look at the underlying asset and assign rating to this cdo say aaa b aa etc which give investor idea of underlying risk    problem here is rating agency gets paid by bank to rate their cdo so if a rating agency starts rating their cdo to higher risk bank will go to next agency round the corner to get better rating and agency will lose commission you can see the problem here    now if people start struggling to pay loan bank will not get money and it can not pay cdo holders if house that was worth $ 100000 when cdo was created is devalued to say $ 50000 today the underlying asset is not worth as much when cdo was sold that is what happened when market crashed in 2008 and gfc hit

my broker offers the following types of sell orders i have a strategy to sell half of my position once the accrued value has doubled   i take into account market price dividends and taxes both and taxes on dividends   once the market price exceeds the magic trigger price by 10 i enter a trailing stop order at 10   ideally what happens is that the stock keeps going up and the trailing stop keeps following it and that goes on long enough that accrued dividends end up paying for the stock   what happens in reality is that the stock goes up some goes down some then the order gets cancelled because the company announces dividends or something dumb like that then i get into trouble trying to figure out how to re enter the order maintaining the unrealized gain in the history of the trailing stop order   i screwed up and entered the wrong type of order once and sold stock i did n't want to lets look at an example a number of years ago i bought some jnj a hundred shares at   accumulated dividends are   my spreadsheet tells me the double price is and double + 10 is   so a while ago jnj exceeded and i entered a trailing stop 10 order to sell 50 shares of jnj   the activation price was   since then the price has gone up and down   it reached a high of setting the activation price at   then jnj announced a dividend and my broker cancelled the trailing stop order   i 've re entered a stop market order at   i 've also entered an alert for $ if the alert gets triggered i 'll cancel the market stop and enter a new trailing stop

so you are off to a really good start   congratulations on being debt free and having a nice income being an it contractor can be financially rewarding but also have some risks to it much like investing   with your disposable income i would not shy away from investing in further training through sites like or to improve weak skills   they are not terribly expensive for a person in your situation   if you were loaded down with debt and payments the story would be different having an emergency fund will help you be a good it contractor as it adds stability to your life   i would keep   £ 10 k or so in a boring savings account   think of it not as an investment but as insurance against life 's woes   having such a fund allows you to go after a high paying job you might fail at or invest with impunity    i would encourage you to take an intermediary step   moving out on your own   i would encourage renting before buying even if it is just a room in someone else 's home   i would try to be out of the house in less than 3 months   being on your own helps you mature in ways that can only be accomplished by being on your own   it will also reduce the culture shock of buying your own home or entering into an adult relationship i would put a minimum of £ 300/month in growth stock mutual funds   keeping this around 15 of your income is a good metric   if available you may want to put this in tax favored retirement accounts   sorry but i am woefully ignorant of uk retirement savings   this becomes your retire at 60 fund   starting now you can retire well before 68   for now stick to an index fund and once it gets to 25 k you may want to look to diversify for the rest of your disposable income i 'd invest in something safe and secure   the amount of your disposable income will change presumably as you will have additional expenses for rent and food   this will become your buy a house fund   this is something that should be safe and secure   something like a bond fund money market dividend producing stocks or preferred stocks    i am currently doing something like this and have 50 in a savings account 25 in a blue chip index fund and 25 in a preferred stock fund   this way you have some decent stability of principle while also having some ability to grow    once you have that built up to about 12 k and you feel comfortable you can start shopping for a house   you may want to be at the high end of your area so you should try and save at least 10 or you may want to be really weird and save the whole thing and buy your house for cash   if you are still single you may want to rent a room or two so your home can generate income    here in the us there can be other ways to generate income from your property   one example is a home that has a separate area and room to park a boat   a boat owner will pay some decent money to have a place to park their boat and there is very little impact to the owner   be creative and perhaps find a way where a potential property could also produce income good luck check back in with progress and further questions edit   after some reading isa seem like a really good deal

yeah i think what 's missing here is that amazon is an absolute last resort place to work   after my experiences with them i would just leave the industry and go hang before i 'd work there   there 's a lot getting lost in this 50,000 jobs these are n't shovel ready jobs these are jobs that amazon would likely just not fill if they could n't find exactly the right people    the average tenure for an amazon engineer is one year   people hate working there and nobody plans on staying long   they are the most dangerous and toxic workplace in the country right now and whatever formula they have for extracting value from human misery had better stay locked up in the vault with the kfc recipe or everyone in this business is screwed this is where you go work for a year after school get burnt and use the skills to go find a better place to work   think foxconn not cool startup with perks there are some cities who could benefit from this but i think they 're the least likely to get this   so far california offers the best mix of talent and tax incentives so far imo   whoever gets this will probably not benefit in any way that 's how bezos operates   this will flood your city with 50,000 dumb ass 22 year olds who do n't care about spending 60 of the income on this is the first time they 've paid it do n't have time for life outside of work and who plan on quitting when the lease is up   if you 're an uber driver of a condo tower builder you 'll benefit

this is normal for credit cards   as long as you make the credit card company 's cutoff time they will make the funds available on your credit card rather than make you wait for them to actually get the funds from your bank the amount of time this takes actually can vary significantly from bank to bank you do want to make sure funds are available in your bank account for them to withdraw when they do take them though if not the payment would get returned and can set red flags on your credit card account that take a while to drop off

i think for this a picture is worth a thousand words   this is a depth chart that i pulled from google images specifically because it does n't name any security   on the left you have all of the bids to buy this security on the right you have the asks to sell the security   in the middle you have the bid ask spread this is the space between the highest bid and the lowest ask   as you can see you are free to place you order to the market to buy for and someone else is free to place their order to the market to sell for   when the bid and the ask match there 's a transaction for the maximum number of available shares   alternatively someone can place a market order to buy or sell and they 'll just take the current market price retail investors do n't really get access to this kind of chart from their brokers because for the most part the information is n't terribly relevant at the retail level

i 've done exactly what you say at one of my brokers   with the restriction that i have to deposit the money in the right way and i do n't do it too often   the broker is meant to be a trading firm and not a currency exchange house after all   i usually do the exchange the opposite of you so i do usd > gbp but that should n't make any difference i put right in quotes not to indicate there is anything illegal going on but to indicate the broker does put restrictions on transferring out for some forms of deposits     so the key is to not ach the money in nor send a check nor bill pay it but rather to wire it in   a wire deposit with them has no holds and no time limits on withdrawal locations   my us bank originates a wire i trade at spot in the opposite direction of you usd > gbp wait 2 days for the trade to settle then wire the money out to my uk bank   commissions and fees for this process are low   all told i pay about $ 20 usd per and get spot rates though it does take approx 3 trading days for the whole process assuming you do n't try to wait for a target rate but rather take market rate

i can see that building credit is a valid reason i would also suggest another scenario when you have locked up money in long term savings with a substantial penalty for early withdrawal if you suddenly needed money then you might save money by borrowing against the long term deposit rather than pay the penalties this is especially true if you needed the money only for a short time

i agree that college does n't or should n't have to be all about job prep    however the caveat i will add is that if you go into debt for your education you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you    the last point about subsidized college being cheaper than the current system i do n't know i 'd have to see these reports you speak of and who made them and for what incentive   at the end of the day though these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to free aka subsidized education
# 190687
assuming your investments are n't in any kind of tax advantaged account like an ira they are generally not tracked and you indeed may pay more taxes   what will likely change however is your cost basis   you only pay tax on the difference between the value of the investment when you sell it and its value when you bought it there is no rule that says once you sell an investment and pay taxes on the gain you will never again pay any taxes on any other investments you then buy with that money   if you own some investment and it increases in value and then you sell it you had a capital gain and owe taxes depending on your tax bracket etc   if you use the money to buy some other investment and that increases in value and then you sell it you had another separate capital gain and again owe taxes however every time you sell you only are subject to capital gains taxes on the gain not the entire sale price   the value of the investment at the time you bought it is the cost basis   when you sell you take the sale price and subtract the cost basis to find your gain so suppose you bought $ 1000 worth of some etf many years ago   it went up to $ 2000 and you sold it   you have $ 2000 in cash but $ 1000 of that is your original money back so your capital gain is $ 1000 and that is the amount on which you owe or may owe taxes   suppose you pay 15 tax on this as you suggest that is $ 150 leaving you with $ 1850   now suppose you buy another etf with that   your cost basis is now $ 1850   suppose the investment now increases in value again to $ 2000   this time when you sell you still have $ 2000 in cash but this is now only $ 150 more than you paid so you only owe capital gains taxes on that $ 150   a 15 tax on that would be $ in that example you had one capital gain of $ 1000 and a second of $ 150 and paid a total of $ in taxes 150 +   suppose instead that you had held the original investment and it had increased in value to $ and you had then sold it   you would have a single capital gain of $ minus the original 1000 you paid   15 of this would be the same $ you paid under the other arrangement   so in essence you pay the same taxes either way   this example is simplified of course in reality the rate you pay depends on your overall income so you could pay more if you sell a lot in a single year since it could push you into a higher tax bracket so none of the money is tax exempt but each time you sell you reset the counter by paying tax on your gain and each time you buy you start a new counter on the basis of whatever you pay for the investment   assuming you 're dealing with ordinary investment instruments like stocks and etfs this basis information is typically tracked by the bank or brokerage where you buy and sell them   technically speaking it is your responsibility to track and report this when you sell an investment and if you do complicated things like transfer securities from one brokerage to another you may have to do that yourself   in general however your bank brokerage will keep track of cost basis information for you

i can not answer the original question but since there is a good deal of discussion about whether it 's credible at all here 's an answer that i got from bank of america note the fine difference between your account and our account which does not seem to be a typo the payment method is determined automatically by our system   one of    the main factors is the method by which pay to recipients prefer to    receive payments   if a payment can be issued electronically we    attempt to do so because it is the most efficient method    payment methods include electronic   payment is sent electronically prior to the deliver by date   the funds for the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date corporate check   this is a check drawn on our account and is mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds to cover the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date laser draft check this is a check drawn on your account and mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds for the payment are deducted from your account when the pay to    recipient cashes the check just as if you wrote the check yourself to determine how your payment was sent click the payments button in    your bill pay service   select the view payment link next to the    payment   payment information is then displayed   transmitted    electronically means the payment was sent electronically   payment    transaction number means the payment was sent via a check drawn from    our account   check number means the payment was sent as a laser    draft check each payment request is evaluated individually and may change each    time a payment processes    a payment may switch from one payment    method to another for a number of reasons   the merchant may have    temporarily switched the payment method to paper while they update    processing information   recent changes or re issuance of your payee    account number could alter the payment method in my case the web site reads a little different payment check 8 digits was sent to company on and    delivered on funds were withdrawn from your named    account on for one due on this must be the corporate check and for another earlier one due on this must be the laser draft check check 4 digits from your named account was mailed to company on    funds for this payment are withdrawn from your account    when the pay to account cashes the check both payments were made based on the same recurring bill pay payment that i set up manually knowing little more of the company than its address

i would not advise this for two reasons your point that the investment could be lower at the end of the 3 years is a concern although with a safe investment it is less so but this reduces the potential gain while your interest is not gaining interest your interest charged is based on the principal if you pay off the loans you reduce the principal and therefore you pay less interest in the long run even if the interest is n't capitalized all that this means is that you are basically being charged simple interest as opposed to compounding interest but reducing the principal helps in either case you are mistaken about the benefits of the tax deduction you reduce your tax bill by the marginal rate times the student loan interest you paid for the year so if you are in the 15 tax bracket and paid $ 100 in interest you save $ 15 this is not a reason to keep the loans because you have to pay $ 100 to get $ 15 but you are mistaken on the benefit it has nothing to do with shifting the tax brackets also speaking of taxes do n't forget that you pay taxes on investment gains

gt;what is your prediction for the next 12 months of the stock market   not good i 'm not seeing any of the factors that contributed to what happened in 2008 change which suggests imho that the market is still really unstable and prone to wild fluctuation and crashes if you like risk perhaps that 's okay but for most investors it 's a nightmare austerity seems to be winning out in government reaction to economic problems instead of stimulus which is only going to shrink demand across the board if you can find something for which there is a hungry consumer base willing and able to pay maybe that 's a good direction to go in but those are more and more rare these days i 'm almost completely withdrawn from the market save for my fun stocks investments i 've made not to make money but just to toy around with and my apple investments which logic and netflix which i support on principle    last year was a good year for investing in healthcare but i 'm not sure how that 's going to pan out this year

well i guess i 'm going to throw a from what others have said so far i have an entry level fp&amp;a job at a medium ish $ 600 m rev size company i use sql all the time we get a lot of data requests and instead of shoveling them over to our tiny it team who is more focused on development we ourselves have to create and validate loads of sql queries for any recurring data requests we throw the queries into a power bi dashboard and do analytics off of it my intuition is that smaller companies fp&amp;a departments are going to overlap more with it when it comes to data due to less defined internal structure so knowing some of the tools it uses can certainly help just knowing how to query company databases if you can get access saves days of waiting + back and forth with it   if you use sql and excel you 'll become familiar with power query which is a useful for automatically transforming raw data a natural extension to sql would then be analytical software or programming like r. companies like the one i work for are trying to figure out business intelligence and we 've implemented suites of which requires an understanding of dax which is only different enough from vb to be annoying imo   be a wizard at excel which i 'm sure you already know know how to apply conditional formatting 46 different ways know how to quickly create and manipulate pivot charts in addition to being a god of pivot table manipulation know how to automate repetitive tasks a big one for me is know how to do reconciliation quickly using excel fp&amp;a does a lot of recon at my work knowing how to cleverly apply and manipulate pivot tables and v can be the difference between spending 4 and 40 hours doing recon   note that these suggestions come from my experience alone

i think you are mixing two different concepts here the average investor in the quoted reference means an average single investor like you or like me the average investor consistently under performs the market however you then ask the question and you seem to refer to all investors as a group individuals institutions investment banks et al since together investors own 100 of the stock in every company every investor could match the performance of the market easily and at low fees by simply buying an s&p index fund and holding it in fact some investors can even beat the market with the addition of some stocks here is the ten year chart of berkshire hathaway b compared to the s&p 500    there are other examples however few of us have the discipline to do so we read questions here every week about the coming in the market about the next big trend about the next bubble etc the average investor thinks he is smarter than the market and buys on a whim or sells likewise and misses out on the long slow overall growth in the markets finally the title of your question is dalbar how can the average investor lose money i doubt that the average investor loses money in the past several years not making as much money as is easily possible is not at all the same as losing money

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

since these indices only try to follow vix and do n't have the underlying constituents as the constituents do n't really exist in most meaningful senses they will always deviate from the exact numbers but should follow the general pattern you 're right however in stating that the graphs that you have presented are substantially different and look like the indices other than vix are always decreasing the problem with this analysis is that the basis of your graphs is different they all start at different dates we can fix this by putting them all on the same graph   this shows that the funds did broadly follow vix over the period 5 years and this also encompasses a time when some of the funds started the funds do decline faster than vix from the beginning of 2012 onward and i had a theory for why so i grabbed a graph for that period my theory was that since volatility had fallen massively after the of the financial crisis there was less money to be made from betting on investing in volatility and so the assets invested in the funds had fallen making them smaller in comparison to their 2011 2012 basis   here we see that the funds are again closely following vix until the beginning of 2016 where they again lower as volatility fell probably again as a result of withdrawals of capital as vix returns fell a tighter graph may show this again as the gap seems to be narrowing as people look to bet on volatility due to recent events so if the funds are basically following vix why has vix been falling consistently over this time increased certainty in the markets and a return to growth or at least lower negative growth in most economies particularly western economies where the majority of market investment occurs and a reduction in the risk of european countries defaulting particularly portugal ireland greece and spain the pigs countries has resulted in lower volatility and a return to market conditions in summary the funds are basically following vix but their values are based on their underlying capital this underlying capital has been falling as returns on volatility have been falling resulting in their diverging from vix whilst broadly following it on the new basis

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

remember that the rental market and the property market are markets   for any given location and level of quality if it were a clearly superior choice to buy over rent then more people would buy and less would rent driving prices down for rentals   the value of owning as opposed to paying rent and never owning is priced into that at least at locations and levels of quality where owning is a possibility and that is nearly always a possibility even at very low levels of quality this is true even disregarding your personal circumstances unless you 're looking in an area that has a lot of people like you san francisco perhaps   given your personal circumstances you have strong incentives to be on the renting side unless there are major pressures on the housing market that cause property to be far cheaper than it should   this was true in 2009 2011 but is mostly not true anymore though some areas have yet to fully come out of the crash
