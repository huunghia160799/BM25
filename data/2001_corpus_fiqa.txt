it is a bit more complicated than whether it pays more or less dividends you should make your decision based on how well the company is performing both fundamentally and technically concentrating mainly on the fundamental performance for this question most good and healthy companies make enough profits to both pay out dividends and invest back into the company to keep growing the company and profits in fact a good indication of a well performing company is when their dividend per share and earnings per share are both growing each year and the dividends per share are less than the earnings per share that way you know dividends are being paid out from new profits and not existing cash holdings this information can give you an indication of both a stable and growing company i would rather invest in a company that pays little or no dividends but is increasing profits and growing year after year than a company that pays higher dividends but its profits are decreasing year after year how long will the company continue to pay dividends for if it starts making less and less profits to pay them with you should never invest in a company solely because they pay dividends if you do you will end up losing money it is no use making $ 1 in dividends if you lose $ 2 + because the share price drops the annual returns from dividends are often between 1 and 6 and in some cases up to 10 however annual returns from capital gains can be 20 50 100 or more for a stable and growing company

someone i forget who did a study on classifying total return by the dividend profiles in descending order by category the results were as follows 1 growing dividends these tend to be moderate say a year in today 's markets because their dividends are starting from a low level the growth of dividends is much higher than stocks in the next category 2 flat dividends these tend to be higher 5 and up but growing not at all like interest on bonds or very slowly less than a year 3 no dividends a neutral posture 4 dividend cutters just bad news

let 's say two companies make 5 profit every year company a pays 5 dividend every year but company b pays no dividend but grows its business by 5 and both spend the money needed to keep the business up to date that 's before profits are calculated   you are right that with company b the company will grow so if you had $ 1000 shares in each company after 20 years company a has given you $ 1000 in dividends and is worth $ 1000 while company b has given you no dividends but is worth a lot more than $ 2000 $ if my calculation is right which looks a lot better than company a.   however company a has paid $ 50 every year and if you put that money into a savings account giving 5 interest you would make exactly the same money either way

maybe i can explain a little clearer your llc is not a person and can not have taxes withheld on its behalf therefore anyone paying your company should not withhold taxes if they are paying you directly and withholding taxes they are treating you as an employee and will probably issue a w2 instead of a 1099   put it this way your llc is a separate company providing services to that company they should n't withhold taxes any more than they would when paying their isp or power company

i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

based on what you wrote you would be better off with no position to start and then enter a buy stop 10 above the market and a sell stop 10 below the market both to open positions depending on which way the market moves if the market does n't move that 10 you stay flat however a long option straddle position requires that the market moves significantly one way or the other just so you recover the premium that you paid for the straddle if the market does n't move you will lose money on your straddle due to theta decay and a drop in volatility alternatively you could buy a strangle with a call strike 10 out and a put strike 10 out the premiums would be much much lower and these take the place of the stop entries personally i would never buy a straddle but i do sometimes sell them especially when implied volatility is very high

you should not open bank accounts just to get additional credit cards you should be careful about carrying too many credit cards and incurring too much debt as you could find yourself in a situation whereby you may not be able to pay off your monthly interest much less the principal balance credit cards are not insurance with many years of experience under my belt i can tell you that the best approach is to live within or below your means and avoid carrying a balance on credit cards i carry only one credit card really a charge card and i pay off the balance every month treat a credit card as a 30 day interest free loan and pay your balance off in full every month as you progress through life you will save yourself a lot of and money if you take this approach

the notion that you can put product on the web and sit back and watch the money roll in is a myth plain and simple   if you put content on the web and expect people to pay money for your products t shirts etc you have to do the work to get your stuff seen by people and preferably the right kind of people who will buy your stuff that means you need to know your market and provide something that they are eager to pay for this does n't necessarily mean buying advertising to direct traffic to your site there are plenty of no cost ways to bring people to your web site but instead of costing $ $ the cost is in effort and time that you have to put into it also keep in mind that the more participants you have in your production and fulfillment pipeline the less you will make off every sale hands off production services like or cafe press do everything for you all you have to do is provide the artwork   however they also take all the income and pay you a rather percentage of sales   you can get a larger percentage of sales if you do more of the work yourself like handmade items sold on etsy   but then you 're doing work maybe you 'll get $ 1 for each t shirt you sell   if you just upload your artwork to the production service and type in some product description text into their web sales catalog how many sales will you make in the first month   most likely somewhere between zero and two   why should anyone buy your shirt over the tens of thousands of other designs carried by the same production service   it 's your responsibility to tell people about your stuff and send them to the site to buy it   and that means it 's not a passive income for truly passive income invest in bank cd 's treasury bonds or in stocks that pay dividends   the only problem with that is you have to have money to make money this way

ca n't vouch for la but property typically is taxed at either the appraised value the most recent purchase price if it was n't worth that much you would n't have paid that much or some combination of the two usually highest of the two to prevent $ 1 and other goods and services from lowering the tax to zero you have now explicitly paid a total of $ 125k for the property the fact that you bought it in two stages should n't be relevant but should and law are only tangentially connected i 'd recommend asking a tax accountant who know your local practices unless someone here can give you an authoritative answer

i am not sure whether this hold in all countries but at least in the netherlands my bank allows for investment in funds without charging transaction costs the downside is that these funds charge an annual fee of about 1 but for the amounts you are talking about this definitely sounds more attractive than the alternative as an alternative you could just take care of the transaction costs that way your child can see their funds develop as you put it into different stocks without being distracted by the details of course you feel the pain but i believe the main lesson stands out most this way

i love reddit but it is an extremely outdated business model modern social media platforms like youtube and instagram go out of their way to encourage user generated content and entrepreneurship their algorithms notice what you 've been watching in my case and push me similar albeit lesser known content like or every frame a painting    contrast that to reddit where on most subreddits original content is outlawed linking to a blog a video a podcast a website an app etc is labeled self promotion and results in a ban so without original content this is what you get memes la times articles cat videos and noob questions    i was recently told by a that original content was unnecessary because of all the great content put out by corporations i m suspicious if this is nt the notion more mods have and it 's an extremely outdated notion user generated niche content is clearly the way the internet is trending and reddit will likely never adjust

i am not an expert in this stuff but my understanding is that the debt is in the form of us treasury securities which mature at set rates and are paid at maturation   so technically the us treasury pays off a portion of its debt whenever the debt securities mature   thus if china or any country buys new treasury securities at a slower rate than its currently held treasury securities are maturing the amount of us debt held by china will decrease   this is what i hear china has been doing recently

first of all look for a savings account with a decent interest rate online banks are good at offering those and you can transfer your money back and forth from the checking account with a couple of business days delay ing direct offers 1.1 apy right now lame but much better than nearly nothing if you 'd like a little nicer rate of return you should also consider putting some of the money the part you need least in a short- or intermediate term bond etf or mutual fund you can sell them quite readily they pay more interest than a savings account and because of the shorter maturities involved the interest rate risk is limited that 's the one that makes your bonds less valuable now because the rates went up after you bought them i have some nyse that 's yielding 3.8 or so

the whole concept of spending a fraudulent check is misleading both in practice and legally there are two separate transactions you not receiving funds by depositing a fraudulent check and you sending a cash transfer further on regarding the fraudulent check generally your bank is responsible in the sense that it 's their responsibility to recover the money from you it will not receive any money from the bank that supposedly issued the fake check and if they give it to you you spend all that money and are unable to pay it back that 's their problem and not of the other institutions regarding the cash transfer from the bank point of view it 's solely your responsibility it was really you who made that payment you explicitly authorised instructed the banks to deliver money to the recipient and none of those banks have the duty to return it you have been defrauded by the recipient of this payment and may attempt to recover the money from the fraudster but that 's not particularly likely to happen even in the case of a successful arrest and conviction   very fast reaction with involvement of police may block the vendor 's account before they are able to withdraw the money if that is the case you might be able to recover your money or part of it

if the 6 credits per semester working part time schedule includes no loans consider this   yes it may take you twice as long to finish but you 'll have a lot of working experience and zero student loans when you 're done compare this to someone who graduates in four years and has 20k in student loans   if they set up a 20 year repayment for the loans they 'll still have 16 18k left to pay and 4 years of job experience    you 'll have 8 years of half time job experience and zero debt   the key would be to find a job in your area of interest   more ideal would be one that pays for classes as a benefit   then you might increase your class load and decrease the total time to graduate and have relevant job experience when you graduate

with regards to the stock market there are actually two markets involved here primary market value is created in the primary market where capital is exchanged for a residual interest in an opportunity   as a theoretical example if a person operating solo or with a small team were to discover or create a breakthrough product such as an retro aging pill that person likely would n't have the financial means to fully capitalize on his new found idea   others with more capital may also soon discover his idea or improve upon it and exploit it before he has a chance to for a real life example a person studying at a california university during the 1990s discovered a method to index internet webpages and was approached by some students after a talk on the subject   he returned to his native southern europe country seeking funds to develop the web indexing business and failed to do so   two of the students that approached him found capital readily available from investors in their campus sphere their business is today one of the biggest in the world   they had exchanged part of their residual interest for capital to develop their business the primary market of the stock market works mostly same in creating value   it is also dependent upon the secondary market secondary market the secondary market indicates the day to day value of an enterprise   that market allows shareholders to manage their risk appetites and the enterprise 's operators to execute their shareholders interest for gains   in most cases a secondary market reference will be used for pricing a primary market issuance   without that reference capital would be allocated less efficiently creating additional costs for all involved issuers and investors consider what would happen if you sought to purchase a house and the mortgage lenders had no indication what the property was worth   this would make capital very expensive or possibly deny you access to credit   by having an indication all involved are better off   that is value creating there are some large developed economies equity markets such as that in germany where many large enterprises stay privately held and credit financing mostly from banks is used   the approach has proven successful as well so why do some nations financial markets still rely on capricious stock markets when private credit financing may do just fine in many cases   it 's largely a matter of national culture   countries such as the netherlands the uk and the us have long had active equity markets in continuous use that investors have trusted for centuries conclusion when leaders of an enterprise wish to grow the business to a large size with investment from the stock market they are n't limited by the size of their banks capital   those leaders and their prospective investors will rely on the secondary market to determine values   in addition if the leaders raise equity instead of debt capital they are usually accorded more flexibility to take risks since shareholders usually have their own flexibility to transfer those risks to other investors if for any number of reasons they choose to do so stock markets create value in many other ways   the above are the main ways

i started my account with $ 500 so i know where you 're coming from   for the words of caution in about 2009 we entered a pretty significant bull market   during this period you could basically buy almost any big name company and do pretty well for yourself   so do n't be too about your ability to pick winners in the middle of a bull market   over the last few years you 'd have to try pretty hard to consistently pick losers i absolutely think you should put real money in the game when you have this sort of interest   however at your $ 400 600 level broker fees will eat any sort of active trading or short term profit you could muster   stock trading is not a great way to make money in the short term   if you 're looking to save for something specific you should put that money in a zero risk savings account    you should do more research on brokers   find the lowest possible trade commission at an organization where you can meet the account opening minimum   a $ 10 commission is 11 more than a $ 9 commission

i 'll echo many factors brand there are generally two levels of pricing major brand and discount brand you can generally expect the discount brand to cost about 5 10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as major brand gas this is for a number of sub factors chief among them is that not all are created equal a lot of the major brands shell chevron bp exxon have proprietary and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not they 're also generally closer to the real rating of the gas have less ethanol you 'll see the sign that says contains up to 10 ethanol the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top tier brands keep it lower and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance anyone who tells you that all gas is the same send em my way i tried to save a few buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of causing premature wear a couple of my co workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank was n't properly and they got water into their gas tanks market price yes this is of course a factor generally gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up then fall more slowly than the market price because the margins on gas sales for a c store are very slim when prices change the c stores lose either way when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last to buy the next one and when prices fall they do n't recoup the cost of their current tank by quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses they mitigate the losses both ways overhead a gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land both to buy lease it and in property taxes nicer newer cleaner stations generally have to pay more to stay that way the higher your operating costs the more you 'll have to charge for your gas you can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities taxation most states charge a tax on gasoline in addition to a federal tax on gas that revenue either goes into the state 's general fund or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance california 's gas prices are sky high across the state because they have the highest gas tax i 'm not sure colorado wyoming and have gas taxes at all proximity to other stations no matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities if there 's another station across the street you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet while predatory pricing taking a loss on sales in one area by profits elsewhere in order to drive out competition is technically illegal you see it all the time in the c store industry and it is very difficult to prove this is a primary cause of neighborhood to neighborhood changes a c store will look around the other stations on their street corner and the ones down the road a block or two each direction when determining what they can sell gas for that day the guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations population distribution with a lot of people in a particular area there 's a big pie of customer dollars for c stores to compete for this generally leads to increased prices because the stations do n't have to be as cutthroat regardless of how good your price is you have only so many pumps and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one the reverse is true in rural areas with only two stations in an entire small town those two stations will become extremely cutthroat however rural prices also vary more with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas they can charge you $ 6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want and you 'll pay it because the next gas station 's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices this along with overhead is generally why the states have the lowest average prices land 's cheap and people are scarce in wyoming but the price gouging can be seen in the rural southwest where there 's a lot of ground to cover between gas stations and so the last chance gas along major highways just outside of town each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station is a common stereotype transportation costs prices are higher on the east and west than in the gulf states for a very simple reason the bulk of the u.s. refinery capacity is along the gulf coast between and the florida border the further you are from there the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station and that cost is reflected at the pump in fact the east coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the united states is now a net exporter of gasoline because it 's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the gulf states and the eastern

after the deal which is expected to close by early next year burger king and tim horton said their newly combined company would have about $ 23 billion in sales and more than 18,000 locations the corporate headquarters will be in canada but burger king will still be operated out of miami   so it can be considered an inversion     do you understand how companies avoid taxes in these deals   the us taxes all your revenue at 35 and then gives you credit for foreign taxes paid   in many other countries they just tax you for domestic revenue not world wide    so previously burger king had to pay 35 tax on all revenue world wide and then got back credits for taxes paid in say canada or england    now they will pay 35 only on us income and the foreign tax in those countries it operates which can be much less than 35

generally if you are trend trading and if the market as a hole is going up strongly and an individual stock is falling sharply on the same day i would tend to stay away from buying that stock at the moment the market is showing strength whilst at the same time the stock is showing weakness the general rule of thumb for trend trading is to buy rising stocks in a rising market or you could look to short sell falling stocks in a falling market

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

we need to be careful what we are talking about here inflation on a economy level scale at an expected rate will not change consumer habits because the price increase is manageable you have to realize that prices are not increasing in isolation wages will have to rise along too   high inflation that is expected will increase consumption of durable goods as people attempt to get rid of their money before the price changes on them a good example of this was post wwi germany where hyperinflation was so bad that offices began to pay their employees twice daily so they could adjust their wages and so that their employees could go out during lunch and after work to buy something with the money before the price changed on them unexpected inflation may cause a temporary dip in spending until wages adjust however consumers still need to buy so they will likely push for higher wages leading to consumption to stay about level there is another effect to inflation as well people who have savings will have their savings eroded over time if the economy is inflationary to preserve their wealth they will invest it in a deflationary environment money will increase in value simply by being hoarded so they will be less willing to invest it deflation also increases the cost of interest on a loan while inflation decreases it so the overall effect is for an increase in spending under inflation and a decrease under deflation the person you have quoted is quite wrong price increases in a particular sector will cause consumer spending to decrease but this is a bad example as it is not inflation but rather a supply demand problem of a particular consumer good they are applying a micro economic model price increases of a single good to a macroeconomic problem price increases in the entire economy when price increases at a global scale have the opposite effects a good theoretical test of this is what would happen if everyone in the us suddenly had twice as much money ignoring international trade of course the answer prices will double and nothing else will change the reason is people will have more money to spend but will require more money for their services so in the end it all cancels out

if it helps you to think about it long is equivalent to betting for the upside and short is equivalent to betting for the downside if you are long on options then you expect the value of such options to increase   if you are long an option then you own the option   if you are short an option then generally you sold the option   someone who is short a call sometimes called the writer or occasionally the issuer has sold a call option to someone who is now long a call buying a call option that will increase in value is itself a form of investment just as it 's investment to buy stock or other instruments hoping they will appreciate in value   an option 's value will rise or fall with the underlying so being long an option is a way to be long in the underlying   someone can be long in a stock by buying the stock or long in a call by buying call options in the stock   the long call generally requires less initial investment than buying the underlying and lets the option holder avoid the asset downside during the option term   the risk is that the asset may not appreciate to the point that the call option will pay off in the conceptual sense a share of stock is a particular right to the profits and assets of a corporation both in form of dividends and in liquidation   an option is a particular right to the the share of stock   it 's just a further way to formalize and the various property rights that exist in a corporation   if you can buy a piece of paper with particular rights to corporate profits and assets then you can buy another piece of paper with particular rights to the former piece of paper

in addition to the higher risk as pointed out by you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short   if you own a stock you are shorting the irs could view the transaction as a sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to wash sale rules   this added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced you should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to re the uptick rule or some circuit breaker variant designed to prevent short sellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short   in the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time   in either case should such a rule be then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells    as to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of etf 's classified as inverse exchange traded funds etf 's for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question   one such example for a common broad market is ticker sh the short s&p500 etf which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the s&p500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly + 15 performance of the s&p500 over the last 12 months sh is down roughly -15 over the same period   the wikipedia article on inverse etf 's lists a number of other such funds covering various markets    i think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent   a more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like cd 's or treasury instruments   in that case you preserve your capital regardless of what happens in the market using an inverse etf otoh means that if the market went bull instead of bear you would lose money instead of merely holding your position

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

in the u.s. publicly traded companies are under the rules of regulation fair disclosure which says that a company must release information to all investors at the same time   the company website and social media both count as fair disclosure because every investor has access to those outlets but a press release service could also be the first outlet   what is forbidden by this regulation is the practice of releasing news first to the brokers who could inform certain customers of the news early i think that the first outlet for press releases could be different for each company depending on the internal procedures of the company   some would update their website first and others would wait to update the site until the press release hits the first

yes you can transfer money to your account any bank will do it the conversion charges will be there i.e. the diff between usd and the rate at which the bank sells it usually rs in addition transaction charge not very high as for taking from friends repaying in india check uae tax for taking money from friends is it considered as your income are you liable for taxes as for giving back get some documentation done as a loan otherwise your friends may be considered to be taking gift consideration income from you and taxed most straight forward way is to transfer the money from your mother 's account

i can describe the method for determining a price floor which may help it starts with looking at the cost of mining there 's a ridiculously small amount of gold in the best ore so it 's measured in tonnes of ore to produce a given ounce of gold mines will only operate at a loss for so long so for any mine which focuses on gold when the price of gold is below that price for long enough the mine will cease operation since not all mines have the same cost the supply will not appear as a step function it will reduce slowly as mines close   gold drops below cash cost approaches marginal production costs offers a marginal cost of production just over $ 1100 this is not a floor price as the market can act irrationally at times it 's just a number to consider   on the demand side the industrial use i am thinking gold plating in electronics manufacturing will serve to provide demand almost regardless of price when a $ 100 uses say 10 cents worth of gold at $ $ 1500 gold increases the final chip price by 1/2 the industry is still trying to move away from gold where they can but that 's a long process   as far as a ceiling goes i highly recommend the book extraordinary popular delusions the madness of crowds which offers insight on a number of mania that have occurred not just in the past few decades but over the centuries at $ the value of all the gold in the world is about us$ that 's 12 zeros given that a portion of it is in jewelry and not available as an investment it 's safe to say that the entire world can only easily bid on about 1/3 of this as the gold council cites 31 of gold going towards investments each year vs 57 jewelry and 11 industrial or us$ 2.5 t or so with total world wealth at us$ 125 t it would take a bit more to push gold from its current 2 of that value funny how that number lined up perfectly to much higher   note i provided a number of links as it 's too easy to just throw numbers around see the links and provide more current data if you 're so inclined data is n't real time

this is perfect for the eli5 posts that always come up on this topic   great article   i 'd be interested in seeing a little more on the regulatory aspects of derivative contracts   derivatives are complex because the associated risks are complex   when banks insurers and other entities large enough to have a chief risk officer enter into these contracts the assumption is that they know what they 're doing so to my knowledge they 're generally lightly regulated   additionally those that understand derivatives enough to regulate them are unlikely to work for the comparatively low wages that they 'd get in government that said i 'd be interested in seeing something discussing the challenges in regulating something like this   even before 2008 there were some pretty big failures involving derivatives where risk was not adequately managed that probably would n't have been avoided with stronger regulation

many good answers here especially that you have to consider that renting may be more expensive than you 'd think also keep in mind that rent is money that is completely lost even if the property has dropped in value if you keep paying you will be able to recuperate part of your mortgage payments when you sell the house normally this is about + -30 but you need to calculate this yourself by dividing the expected sales price of the house by the total mortgage payments you have to make to pack back everything so i 'd say walking away only makes sense if the rents around where you want to live are much lower than < + -30 your mortgage payment and stable in of walking away immediately perhaps you can refinance your mortgage with a new one in 2008 the rates were around 5.8 now they are around 3.6 or so i do n't know how it goes in the usa but in my country if the rates drop it is relatively to do this and it can save people who refinance thousands if not more

has provided a good answer i 'm only addressing my comment about the data quality the portfolio optimization technique you employed is very sensitive to the inputs in particular it relies entirely on the mean and assumptions i.e. the first two moments and the results could change drastically with very small amount of change in the inputs to see that you can make up some inputs for the solver you have and try adjusting the inputs a little bit and see the results therefore if you decide to take this approach data quality is very crucial edit what i meant by data quality i have no experience with this website but this should be easy to spot check the answer is usually yes for liquid assets illiquid assets can often be priced at a level with no volume and the bid ask spread could be huge   should i close my eyes on the fact that these are n't perfectly priced in my currency and use another one such as the dollar you seem to have concern about data quality in at least the price quoted in your currency and are thinking about using data quoted in usd but would it be any better the law of one price tells us that there should n't be any discrepancy between prices in different currencies otherwise there would be arbitrage in addition when compared to traditional assets cryptocurrency price data has a shorter data history and with lower liquidity in the market the short history means you have less data to infer the characteristics of the price behavior low liquidity means the volatility may well be underestimated so we have an input sensitive technique combined with not so perfect data i would n't allocate my money solely based on the result of this exercise edit i have quite some reservation about doing portfolio optimization for cryptocurrency personally i 'm not a fan of the technique as is the optimization has an underlying assumption that returns follow a certain distribution and correlation is fixed i do n't know if you can make such assumption for cryptocurrencies from what i read about btc for example it seems to have a high risk exposure concerning chinese monetary policy for that kind of assets perhaps a fundamental analysis approach is a better one   also if you would like to learn more about portfolio optimization try quant se

given that the laws on consumer liability for unauthorized transactions mean no cost in most cases the cvv is there to protect the merchant   typically a merchant will receive a lower cost from their bank to process the transaction with the cvv code versus without as far as the netflix case goes or any other recurring billing for that matter they would n't care as much about it because visa mc amex regulations prohibit storage of the cvv   so if they collect it then it 's only used for the first transaction and just use the rest of the card info name expiration date address does the presence of cvv indicate the merchant has better security   maybe maybe not   it probably means they care about their costs and want to pay the bank as little as possible to process the transaction

a statistical measurement is still more honest than no measurements at all for economics we do n't have a reference frame for the absolute truth there is no way to judge the absolute accuracy of a theory given that at least a theory that matches real observational data is more real than something that does not match observations    and quantitative easing has been in many ways one of the largest economic experiments there were competing theories on what it would do and one thing was certain monetary velocity is inversely related to wealth even kansas was an experiment something was predicted by gov. brown back and that something turned out to be wrong in the light of observations i find it astonishing to hold on to a theory whose predictions have just not panned out   monetary velocity may still be wrong but on a relative scale of it is still much less inaccurate than the laffer curve

for what it 's worth and i realize this is n't directly an answer to the question one of the advantages of sticking with mutual funds beyond their being inherently diversified is that it removes a lot of the temptation to try to time the market when you need money you sell shares in such a way that it maintains your preferred investment ratio and simply do n't worry about which stocks are   actually involved i 've gotten 15 apr this year across all my investments for absolutely minimal effort that 's quite good enough for me

investment is very uncertain so i believe that unless you have loads of money you should not play around with houses for the sole purpose of investing here are the questions which i would consider to judge the situation note that this is based on the current situation in the netherlands income your income is 1800 a month nett which means your gross annual income should be somewhere below allowed mortgage amount your maximum morgage amount is then roughly is it expensive given your maximum morgage buying a 200k appartment would consume pretty much all your cash there is some cost of buying the appartment so basically if you buy it you will not have much cash to decorate or deal with unforseen maintenance if you are conservative i would say that buying a appartment is financially much more relaxing in your situation what will be the monthly expense monthly mortgage payments will be about so your cashflow will suffer a bit   the amount you actually burn on interest in the early months is about 180 nett assuming an interest rate just below 2 and tax deductions there will be additional costs more heating long term maintenance etc so overall the amount of money you burn will be close to the amount of money you burn on rent of course over time there will be less interest so this should go down value change the value may go up or down in the very long term i would bet on it going up but on the short or medium term it is quite uncertain if you may live there for less than a decade value change is more of a risk than a benefit break even point as you mention that you will buy a house for 200k i will assume it is not in the heart of a major city and that renting it out may not be very attractive however i will also assume that it is not the middle of nowhere and that it will only take a reasonable amount of time to sell the house so if you want to move out you will probably sell it at a reasonable price in this case a rule of thumb is that living in an affordable house is usually a good idea when you live there for more than 5 years is it likely that you will find a partner in this period of time and will you live at your place then or somewhere else buying a 200k appartment would leave you completely cashless after you move in something i would not recommend unless you can depend on your parents for instance to bridge the gap when your cashflow dries up from a monthly expense point of view you are probably going to be ok as long as you survive the short run and financially it only makes sense if you are going to live there for a while and are fairly confident in your position in the labour market i would personally recommend you to think hard on your family situation and only buy a house if it leaves you with some cash in your pocket

your question indicates that you might have a little confusion about put options and/or leveraging   there 's no sense i 'm aware of in which purchasing a put levers a position   purchasing a put will cost you money up front   leveraging typically means entering a transaction that gives you extra money now that you can use to buy other things   if you meant to sell a put that will make money up front but there is no possibility of making money later   best case scenario the put is not exercised   the other use of the term leverage refers to purchasing an asset that proportionally goes up faster than the value of the underlying   for example a call option if you purchase a put you are buying downside protection which is kind of the opposite of leverage   notice that for an american put you will most likely be better off selling the put when the price of the underlying falls than exercising it   that way you make the money you would have made by exercising plus whatever optional value the put still contains   that is true unless the time value of money is greater than the optional insurance value   since the time value of money is currently exceptionally low this is unlikely   anyway if you sell the option instead of exercising you do n't need to own any shares at all   even if you do exercise you can just buy them on the market and sell right away so i would n't worry about what you happen to be holding the rules for what you can trade with a cash instead of a margin account vary by broker i think   you can usually buy puts and calls in a cash account but more advanced strategies such as writing options are prohibited   ask your broker or check their help pages to see what you have available to you

what makes the s&p 500 index funds have low expenses ratios is that the amount of money spent by the mutual fund company on research is zero standard and poors does the research the fund companies piggy back on that research   another big factor in keeping expenses low is the fact the companies that makeup the index do n't change very often if the fund frequently changes the makeup of the investments not only can that trigger tax considerations but there are costs associated with all those transactions the question is do the other algorithms overcome the additional costs due to higher expenses and taxes

excellent question and it is a debate that is often raised   mathematically you are probably best off using option 1   any money that is above and beyond minimum payments earns a pretty high interest rate about in the form of saved interest payments the problem is you are likely to get discouraged   personal finance is a lot about behavior and after working at this for a year and still having 5 loans albeit a lower balance might take a bit of fight out of you paying off such a large balance in a reasonable time will take a lot of fight with the debt snowball you pay the minimum to the student loan save in an outside account and when it is large enough you execute option 2   so a year from now you might only have three loans instead of five   if you behaved exactly the same your balance would be higher after that year then using the previous method however often one does not behave the same   because the goals are shorter and more attainable it is easier to delay some gratification   the 8 dollars you are saving in your weekly gas budget because of low prices is meaningful when saving for a 4 k goal where it is meaningless when looking at it as a 74 k goal   with the 4 k goal you are more apt to put that money in your savings where the 74 k goal you might spend it on a latte for me the debt snowball worked really well with either option make sure that excess payments actually go to a reduction in principle not a prepayment of interest   given this you may be left with no option   for example if method 1 you only prepay interest you are forced to use option 2

i do n’t know specifics of the situation but one possibility would be that buffett may have billions in various assets etc companies he owns stocks bonds but if he does n’t sell any of those stocks or cash in any of those bonds then on paper he did n’t make any money that year because he ’s letting the assets appreciate i would say net income is the amount of income you claimed that year so if you had sold some stock the amount of money you sold them for would be your income as opposed to net worth being if they wanted to if buffett sold all of his stocks and assets he would be able to get billions for it so while he technically is worth billions on his tax returns he does n’t claim much income

you really should consider sitting down with an independent financial advisor to run the numbers for the various options and discuss what risks you 're comfortable with and what your requirements goals are this is n't a simple decision   unfortunately advice i 've seen suggested that some portion of the money should stay in the market earning market rate of return exactly how much and invested in what is complicated an annuity is essentially an insurance policy   the company assumes the risks and promises you specific payments in exchange for keeping the money   they would n't do so if they did n't think that on average they 'll pay out less than the combination of your purchase price plus earnings so you really are paying a fee for this service whether it 's worth that cost and for how much of your money depends on how much you have saved and how risk tolerant you are i 'm going to steal a moment here to point out that many charities offer annuities these may or may not pay out less than commercial annuities   but the profits go to a better cause either way if you plan to leave part of your estate as donation to a charity anyway this basically lets them have the money earlier while you continue to receive income from it

as others have said please talk to a professional adviser from my quick research domain names can only be amortized as 197 intangible if it 's used for the taxpayer 's business for example if corp a pays $ 200,000 for and uses that to point to their homepage they can amortize it over 15 years as a 197 intangible please refer to this irs memo the above memo does not issue any guidance in your case where domains are purchased for investment or resale regarding domain names the u.s. master depreciation guide 2016 by says many domain names are purchased in a secondary market from third parties who register names and resell them at a profit these cost must be capitalized because the name will have a useful    life of more than one year the costs can not be amortized because a    domain name has no useful life so your decision to capitalize is correct but your amortization deductions may be challenged by the irs when you sell your domain the gain will be determined by how you treat these assets if you treat your domains as 197 intangibles and thus had ordinary deductions through amortization your gain will be ordinary if you treated them as capital assets your gain will be a capital gain very conceptually and because the irs has not issued specific guidelines i think holding domain names for resale is similar to buying stock of a company you ca n't amortize the investment and when you sell the gain or loss is a capital gain loss

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

what drives the stock of bankrupt companies such stock is typically considered distressed assets   technically what drives it is what drives every stock supply and demand a more interesting question is of course why would there be demand first who the buying pressure on the stock typically three types of entities the largest ones are financial institutions specializing in distressed assets frequently alternatives specialists hedge funds private equity firms etc usually they invest in distressed debt or distressed preferred equity but sometimes distressed equity as well why we will discuss their motivations separately in this answer second one are existing equity holders   why short answer behavioral psychology and behavioral economics many investors especially non professionals insist on holding distressed stocks due to variety of investment fallacies sunk cost etc usually constructing elaborate theories of why and how the company and the stock will recover sometimes people who buy into penny stock scams pump and dump schemes etc why there 's a sucker born every minute let 's find out why an investment professional would invest in distressed equity first the general process is always the same company 's assets are used to pay off its liabilities in accordance with applicable law there are two ways this can be done either through selling the company or through bankruptcy process the liabilities are paid according to seniority the seniority priorities rules are covered by 11 u.s. code priorities a company in bankruptcy can have one of 2 outcomes buyout some buyer might decide that the company 's assets are worth something to them as a whole and buy the whole enterprise rather than risk it being destroyed piecemeal in bankruptcy proceedings in that case the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the liabilities as discussed above this option is one of the possible reasons people might consider investing in distressed equity   for example if the company is in bankruptcy because it ca n't get enough financing right now but is likely to have good profits in the future the chances are some buyer will buy it for a premium that includes those future profits and that sale amount might possibly exceed the liabilities bankruptcy the assets are sold and liabilities are covered according to priorities in that case the investors in distressed equity might be hoping that there are un obvious assets whose value would also put the total assets above claimed liabilities additional possible beneficial factor is that unsecured debtors must file with the court in order to be paid and the claim must be validated some might fail on either count so total amount of liabilities might lessen once the bankruptcy process goes through assets now here 's where things get interesting of course companies have usual assets real estate inventory plants cash etc these are all able to be sold to cover liabilities and at first glance are possibly not enough to cover liabilities leaving equity holders with nothing and even that 's not a certainty bankruptcy is simply inability to service debt payments and while it correlates to assets not full asset valuation but some assets are less sure and are thus rarely included in such calculations these may include chances of winning appeals if specific existing liabilities are results of litigation e.g. tax appeals court judgement appeals etc and lawsuits against former executives especially in cases where the company 's financial distress resulted from executive malfeasance i was personally involved in one such case as an equity holder where the company assets were valued at $ x had liabilities of $ but had a real possibility of winning about $ in a lawsuit against former ceo accused of various malfeasance including fraud and insider trading as such the best case scenario was literally 100 profit on holding that distressed equity

i do n't think there 's anything to worry about   does n't really care who 's paying as long as the loan is being paid as agreed   of course you 're helping your dad 's credit history and not your own but i doubt would give back money just because it came from your bank account a business may claim a payment was n't made against the loan but you 'd have the records that you did in fact pay keep those bank statements   in theory they could sue you in practice you 'd send them the proof and they 'd investigate and find the misplaced money   that does happen sometimes the wrong account is credited   if it did end up in court again you 'd win because you have proof you sent payments   even if you put the wrong loan account number to pay to you 'd have proof you in fact sent the money    if you 're talking about something like a loan shark they can do whatever they like   they wo n't sue you though because again you 'd have proof   that 's why they 'd use violence   but probably a loan shark would n't falsely claim you did n't pay if you did as word would get out and the loan shark would lose business   and again as long as they get what 's agreed to they do n't care how they get it or who they get it from

first off you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is safe meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations   your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough   that rules out things like stock market investments secondly you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money   if you have an emergency odds are you do n't want to be waiting around for weeks months years for the money to become available   this rules out most fixed term investments bonds traditional cds etc if you are concerned that you will need near instant access to your emergency money then you probably want to keep it in a savings or money market account at the same bank as your checking account   most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly unfortunately your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the savings mma far below the inflation rate   this means your money will slowly lose value over time   be prepared to keep contributing to it for most people being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days < 1 week is sufficient   worst case you charge something on your credit card and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives if money within a few days is okay for you there are a few options money market mutual funds not to be confused with a money market account this is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund   these are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account   an example of such a fund would be fidelity cash reserves   are not fdic insured so they are not exactly zero risk   however they are considered extremely safe   they almost never go down in value only a few times in the past few decades and when they have the fund manager or the federal govt stepped in to restore the value   they usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account and are available in taxable and non taxable varieties online high yield savings or money market account these are a relatively new invention   it 's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers but it 's online only   no local branch means low overhead so they offer higher interest rates 2.0 vs 0.5 for your local bank   some of them used to be over 5 before the economy tanked   like your local bank it is fdic insured one bit of caution   some of these accounts have become lately   they have started to do things like promo rates for a few months only offering the high interest rate on the first few $ k deposited limiting the amount that can be withdrawn etc   be sure to read the details before you open an account no penalty cds certificates of deposit usually offer a better rate than a savings account but your money is locked up until the cd term is up e.g. 36 months   if you need to cash out before then you pay a penalty   some banks have begun to offer cds that you can cash out with no penalty at all   these can offer better rates than the savings account   make sure it really is no penalty though   also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time   this can be an issue if you want to deposit $ 100 from every paycheck rewards checking accounts these are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate 3 or more provided you generate enough activity   most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month   if you can stay on top of the requirements these can be a great deal   if you do n't stay on top of it your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful though personally we use the online high yield savings account for our emergency fund   i 'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use   the best deal changes almost week to week   instead i will say to check out bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and cds that you can sort   the bank deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes

assuming you 're talking about a property in the united states the answer generally would be no   you are n't actually paying any of the expenses for the property and yet you want to take the deductions for doing so   that 's a rather move i 'd say grin    it probably would lead to some real strife with your brother since he would have proper claim to those credit on the basis he 's the one footing the bills for the property   before you do anything like what you 're talking about it might be best to speak with him because both of you are running the very real risk of an audit and if that happens then i can guarantee the irs will slap the out of you for it   your brother i 'm sure is already claiming all of the deductions he can for what he 's putting into the property and on top of that you want to file for your half   what half are you referring to when your out of pocket is zero   so what you 're saying is you think that between you and your brother you should be able to take a credit of 150 of the actual deductions sounds like a recipe for disaster to me i strongly encourage you to talk to a tax professional but if you get a different answer to this than what i 've already given then i 'd be stunned    i hope this helps good luck

here 's my crude reasoning let 's say you have just one recently acquired credit card with a $ 5000 limit the company that issued the credit card set the $ 5000 limit based on however they assessed your risk now if you 're using a significant portion of of the $ 5000 limit it means at least for them that you are stretching your wallet even if you 've been paying monthly consistently and since you are heavily using your limit it also means that if you lose your primary source of money for even one month income etc then your risk to the lender increases sharply had you been making more money compared to this $ 5000 limit then either you 'd have used less of your available credit or you would've gotten your limits raised by asking your bank to re evaluate your risk and increase the limit also your statement why is a us credit score based on credit utilization is slightly incorrect as per fico credit utilization has 35 weight while your payment history has a weight of 35 to sum it up we can debate if the weight for credit utilization should be higher or lower but unfortunately as others have pointed out these scores are meant to help lenders not consumers so whether we like it or not the secret algorithms to calculate the scores and the actual weights variables and rules they use are completely out of our hands

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

firstly if you 've formed a limited company you do n't need to register as self employed   you 're an employee and shareholder of the company and your taxes will be handled that way registering as self employed is only necessary if you 're operating as a sole trader i.e. without a company secondly you absolutely do want to get set up correctly with hmrc as soon as possible whether you 're a company or a sole trader   ignoring the legal question your worry about paying taxes when you have no income is if you 're not making any money there wo n't be any tax to pay   furthermore it seems likely that the business is currently losing money   those losses if correctly recorded can be carried forward and offset against future profits so not only do you not have to pay tax now but you can reduce the tax you pay later when the money does start rolling in

options are generally viewed as having two types of value intrinsic value and time value   the intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price on the option and the spot price of the underlying   the time value is based on the volatility of the underlying and the amount of time left until expiration   as the days pass toward expiration the time value generally decreases and the intrinsic value may move up or down depending on the spot price of the underlying in theory time value could increase at some points if the volatility is also rising in your case it looks like the time value is decreasing faster than the intrinsic value is increasing this may happen because the volatility is also going down as suggested in the answer by cqm or may just happen because the time to expiration is getting shorter at equal volatility as noted by dumbcoder in a comment to the original question the black scholes formula will give you more analytical insight into this if you 're interested

i believe they manage a bit over 500 million   he is still the founder and probably has control of the company but he is not the ceo he has probably gotten the company to a stable position and wants to move on to other things big deal   if tradeworx is stable and making money it is not a big deal if narang does n't want to micro manage people and run day to day shit someone else can handle that while he can go explore other things   just like de shaw did de shaw got his fund up and running make a ton on money left to do research and the fund still makes money   you can read this to see why he article us markets tradeworx exclusive tradeworx founder narang leaves high frequency firm   narang declined to spell out why he was leaving red bank new jersey based tradeworx but said i had a few differences with the board about the direction of the company   narang said there were no losses or expected losses at closely held tradeworx which he said has a bright future and where he remains a shareholder tradeworx accounts for about 5 to 6 percent of daily u.s. equity market volume sources say   there was no immediate response from tradeworx management   narang has not decided on a future venture but he said he is likely to remain in the financial services industry is talking to people and is looking closely at the options market   i have a whole lot of ideas that excited about that i ’ve been wanting to pursue so now is the time to figure out which of those ideas i ’d like to pursue narang told reuters   particularly interested in options trading i have been for some time that ’s something tradeworx does n’t do many of my ideas are in that space said narang 45 who has degrees in computer science and mathematics from the massachusetts institute of technology     this all really has nothing to do with the original post about comment regarding hft

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

sure it is quite easy depending on income   if one receives a bonus that is high in relationship to their income it is very easy to max out a 401 k prior to when one intended   the later in the year such a bonus occurs the more likely that one will max out prematurely    if one only has a single employer in the year the custodial company will not accept amounts above the max so one need not worry about that case   if there is more than one employer a refund is typically issued with the appropriate tax withheld    assume that a person makes about 60 k per year   they intend to put 12k into their 401 k thus have their contribution set to 20   by the beginning of september they have 8 k into their retirement but they also receive a bonus of 50k.   their 401 k contribution for that bonus will be 10 k and thus they have maxed out their individual contribution for the year so they will not be able to contribute for the rest of the year including the first paycheck in september   they will miss out on any match that the company may supply   while that sucks it should be relieved by the bless of receiving such a large bonus

you have a good start estimated max amount you will pay estimated max down payment and term now go to your bank credit union and apply for the loan get a commitment they will give you a letter you may have to ask for it the letter will say the maximum amount you can pay for the car this max includes their money and your down payment the dealer does n't have to know how much is loan you also know from the loan commitment exactly how much your monthly payment will be in the worst case if you have a car you want to trade in get an written estimate that is good for a week or so this lets you know how much you can get from selling the car now visit the dealer and tell them you do n't need a loan and wo n't be trading in a car do n't show them the letter after all the details of the purchase are concluded including any rebates and specials then bring up financing and trade in if they ca n't beat   the deal from your bank and the written estimate for the car you are selling then the deal is done now show them the letter and discuss how much down they need today then go to the bank for the rest of the money if they do have a better loan deal or trade in then go with the dealer offer and keep the letter in your pocket if you go to the dealer first they will confuse you because they will see the price interest rate length of loan and trade in as one big ball of mud they will pick the settings that make you happy enough yet still make them the most money

are there any advantages to layaway there are two main advantages first when you pay the initial deposit the seller reserves the item for you at a given price this is helpful with unique products like a high end custom made watch if there is only one of those watches in the entire world then it 's nice to know that the seller wo n't sell it to anyone else while you 're getting together the remaining funds and the price you 're paying is locked in second layaway agreements often allow for a payment plan this is helpful for people who have a hard time saving up money for many it 's easier to make smaller monthly payments than a large one time payment of course the cost of layaway is that you 're $ 30,000 short for up to 6 months this money could be generating a significant amount of interest during a half year period you 'll need to make sure that reserving the item and locking in the price are worth this cost

one piece of documentation that might help here is a confirmation of your benefit selections through your employer for each year since the expenses in question were incurred assuming you have a job with eligibility for benefits   if you can prove which accounts you maintained through your your spouse 's if applicable then it is relatively simple to go back through the records for those specific accounts and see if a specific expense was ever reimbursed   obviously you ca n't prove through documentation that you did n't have accounts that do n't exist this seems like it would be more important for the accounts elected by a significant other since i believe reimbursements from an account in your name would typically be reported to the irs on your behalf anyway also keep in mind that the irs wo n't care about each line item individually   their focus will be on whether for any given snapshot in time your total reimbursed amount exceeded your total eligible expenses

i 'll just add this in the best hedge funds and proprietary trading funds stock selection is approached very scientifically in order to minimize losses maximize gains researchers think of a trading idea and carefully test it to see which methods of stock selection work and how well and finally they combine them every day researchers update their models based on the past performance of each indicator   all this is just too much work to be done manually firms use machine learning methods to understand markets they try to figure out what is normal what did not happen correctly at a specific time what will happen in future for instance they use deep learning networks to look at data and figure out what is normal and what is not these networks can analyze an of noise and separate out the signal this is very relevant to finance and markets because finding the patterns and anomalies in market data has been the bread and butter of traders for decades deep learning networks give us applications like feature learning by features i 'm referring to certain attributes in data that indicate an event by anticipating them we can help predict future price movements new technology is allowing us to break new ground in managing risk to be a typical and manage risk in ever improving ways it 's the responsibility of every trader whether working for themselves or others to take advantage of this technology to improve the collective investing experience i care very deeply about this i have many close friends in the finance world and without who have lost large amounts of money to poor trade tools and lack of transparency

i think the part of your question about not wanting to mess up more is the most important element you say you know someone with good credit who is willing to co sign for you but let 's be honest your credit is n't bad for no reason   your credit 's bad because you have a history of not paying on your obligations putting someone else 's credit at risk even though they may be willing to try and help could be doing exactly what you said you 're trying to avoid messing up more   this person 's heart is in the right place but you really have to ask yourself if you should put them in jeopardy by agreeing to guarantee your debts so the vehicle you bought is older and has a lot of miles you knew that when you bought it   so you 're paying a high interest rate because of your bad credit history you knew that when you bought it   why you think the vehicle 's only going to last another year is what confuses me   there are many vehicles out there with much higher mileage that are still on the road and with proper preventative maintenance there 's no reason your truck ca n't do the same the fact is you just do n't like what you 're paying or what you 're driving even though you were good with both when someone was willing to extend you credit so now you see this other person 's willingness to co sign for you as your ticket out of a situation you no longer want to be in my suggestion is that you stay with the loan you have take care of the vehicle to make it last and prove that you can pay your obligations   hopping from loan to loan is n't going to do your credit any favors   one of the big factors for your credit score is the average age of accounts   going and signing a new loan now will only drag that number down and hurt your score not help it   and there 's no guarantee the next car you buy with your friend 's help is going to last the length of that loan either i would be careful about this grass is greener on the other side attitude and just bear through your situation if only to prove to yourself that you can do it    there 's nothing saying your friend wo n't still be willing to co sign for you later on down the line of something does happen to the truck but you can show them that you 're trying to be responsible in the meantime by following through on what you already agreed to

i recommend reading what 's the catch in investing in real estate for rent and making a list of expenses   you have a known expense the rent and the assumption that it will rise a bit each year if not each year eventually the landlord will bump it and on average the rent should track inflation   the buy side is the complete unknown especially to us here the mortgage and taxes are just the beginning my ongoing issue in the buy rent debate is that it 's easy to buy too big or at least far bigger that what you are renting   one extreme a couple moves from their one bedroom apartment into their purchased home with far more space than they ever use no need to paint the full picture of numbers the house is a money pit and they live for the house   other end couple already renting a nice sized home and they buy a similar one they rent out the two spare bedrooms for 5 years until they have kids and want their privacy back they bought smart for less than market price and from day one the mortgage was lower than the rent they paid by year 5 having sent the extra income to pay down the mortgage they 've paid down half the loan as the kids come along they refi to a new 30 yr fixed at 3.5 and the payment is tiny compared to the rest of their budget   simply put the ratio of house price to rent for that same house is not a constant when the ratio is high it 's time to rent when it swings very low it 's worth considering a purchase but the decision is never clear until every detail is known the time may be perfect and the day after you close you lose your job or in a good scenario get a raise and are just because you bought low yesterday does n't mean the market will pay you a good price today it takes time for out of whack pricing to come back to normal   a simple question maybe but we first need a lot of details to help you understand what you are considering

for most people home ownership is a long term lifestyle strategy i.e. the intention is to own a home for several decades regardless of how many times one particular house might be swapped for a different one   in an economic environment with steady monetary inflation taking out a long term loan backed by a tangible non depreciating permanent asset e.g. real estate is in practice a form of investing not borrowing because over time the monetary value of the asset will increase in line with inflation but the size of the loan remains constant in money terms   that strategy was always at risk in the short term because of temporary falls in house prices but long term inflation running at say 5 per year would cancel out even a 20 fall in house prices in 4 years downturns in the economy were often correlated with rises in the inflation rate which fixed the short term problem even faster car and student loans are an essentially different financial proposition because you know from the start that the asset will not retain its value unless you are investing in a vintage car rather than buying a means of personal transportation a new car will lose most of its monetary value within say 5 years or there is no tangible asset at all e.g. taking out a student loan paying for a vacation trip by credit card etc   the over home loans was the widespread realization that the rules of the game had been changed permanently by the combination of an economic downturn plus national or even international financial policies designed to enforce low inflation rates with the consequence that being underwater had been changed from a short term problem to a long term one

gt we make a trade off between time to execute and market impact   is your time frame any longer than intraday i imagine you would n't want to carry that risk overnight if you 're a broker or selling a route   gt we will join the bid for some fraction of our size and also hit the offer when it looks like the price might be moving away from us   so say for instance you join a bid a few levels down you are n't really get filled you start hitting the offer and eventually you realize you 're competing with someone for the shares offered so you take out the price level and bid on all the exchanges so that you 're first on the bid at that level then repeat until someone that can match your appetite starts to fill you on the bid   gt in some certain situations we will even sweep the book several levels deep to avoid tipping off market makers and having them adjust in anticipation of the rest of our order   right so say you need 100k shares there are 10k offered at 9.98 25k offered at 9.99 and 65k at 10.00 you might just enter an sweep order of 100k 10 limit and hope that you can get most of the shares off before everyone can cancel   i imagine there has to be a lot of bidding it up to attract sellers and then letting people take out your bids all day   i have a few other questions i would appreciate your insight on just trying to ascertain how orders are filled when as you put it time is more important than market impact to the client when they need to take a large amount of liquidity as quickly as possible and as orderly as possible   let me know if you 'd rather i pm you about this or the additional questions i work in the industry as well so i know privacy is paramount

keep in mind that credit takes time to build    your best short term solution is to save enough cash to put enough of a down payment that the lower loan to value ratio outweighs the lack of credit history   if there 's enough equity to ensure that the bank will get their money back if they have to foreclose you will have a better chance of securing financing in addition the stability and consistency of your employment may also be a factor that makes it difficult for you to get a loan without a substantial down payment finally do n't ignore the risk present in resting a property that you have a loan on   make sure you have a plan in place to pay your payments if the other half goes for several months or you risk losing the entire property my advice is to rent somewhere else for enough time that you can save up a lot of cash to purchase a duplex rather than getting in a rush and doing something unwise like apply for a bunch of credit cards you do n't need

i have a related issue since i have some income which is large enough to matter and hard to predict start with a best guess check what tax bracket you were in last year and withhold that percentage of the expected non withheld income adjust upward a bit if desired to reflect the fact that you 're getting paid more at the new job adjust again either up or down to reflect whether you were over withheld or under withheld last year whether the irs owed you a refund or you had to send a check with your return repeat that process next year after next tax season when you see how well your guess worked out you could try pre calculating the entire tax return based on your expected income and then divide any underpayment into per paycheck additional withholding but i do n't think it 's worth the effort i do n't worry about trying to get this exactly correct i do n't stress about lost interest if i 've over withheld a bit and as long as your withholding was reasonably close and you have the cash float available to send them a check for the rest when it comes due the irs generally does n't grumble if your withholding was a bit low   it would be really nice if the irs paid us interest on over withholding to mirror the fact that they charge us interest if we 're late in returning our forms oh well despite all the stories the irs really is fairly reasonable if you are n't deliberately trying to get away with something the process is annoying but should n't be scary the one time they mail audited me it was several thousand dollars in my favor i 'd forgotten to claim some investment losses and their computers noticed the error though i still say the motto of the next revolution will be no taxation without proper instructions

the advice is always to not get a big refund from the irs because that is giving them an interest free loan you actually have an opportunity to get an interest free loan from them   when you file your taxes for 2013 note how much you paid in taxes not the check you had to send in with your tax form or the refund you received but the total amount in taxes you paid multiply that amount by 1.1 or 110 for example $ 8,000 1.10 = $ when you get your paychecks in 2014 you goal is to make sure that your federal taxes not state social security or medicare taken from your paycheck will get you over that number $ or a paycheck keep in mind that the later you start the more each check needs to be you will owe them a big check in april 2015 but because of the 110 rule you will not owe interest penalties or have to deal with quarterly taxes the 110 rule you from these if you end them 110 as much a you paid in taxes the previous year note that no matter how you pay your taxes for 2014 big check now extra per paycheck or minimum now you will have to watch your withholding during 2015 because the 110 rule wo n't protect you

at no point is it ever a good idea to stop making payments to show them you mean business when you signed up for the credit card account you agreed to pay what you charged and any applicable interested accrued on the accounts you are legally responsible for that debt and you can be sued if they are so inclined many times settlement agencies are employed because a risk assessment operator or whatever they 're called at your cc company calculated that they are currently financially better off settling for a reduced balance than attempting to chase you for the full amount as soon as the terms of your refinance hits your credit history that changes to reiterate and make it clear this is a very dangerous approach to breaking credit card debt and i would not advise that anybody proceed with it edit if you offer 50 of the balance in a lump sum payment they decline and you continue with non payment they have reason to believe that you are financially capable of making payments and are much more likely to seek legal action

former software developer at an insurance company here not state farm though all of the above answers are accurate and address how the business analysts come up with factors on which to rate your quote i wanted to chime in on the software side here specifically what goes into actually crunching those numbers to produce an end result in my experience business analysts provide the site developers with a spreadsheet of base rates and factors which get imported into a database when you calculate a quote the site starts by taking your data and finding the appropriate base rate to start with usually based on vehicle type quote type personal commercial etc and zip code for the us the appropriate factors are then also pulled and are typically either or additive relative to the base rate the most creative operation i 've seen other than add multiply was a linear to get some kind of gradient value usually based on the amount of coverage you selected at this point you could have upwards of twenty rating factors affecting your base rate marriage status reports basically anything you might 've filled into your application in the case of reports specifically we 'd usually verify your input against an providing service to check that you did n't omit any violations but we would n't penalize for lying about it we did n't get that creative then we 'd apply any fees and discounts before out the final number with all that said these algorithms that companies apply to calculate quotes are confidential as far as i 'm aware insofar as they do n't publish those steps anywhere for the public to access the type of algorithm used could even vary based on the state you live in or really just when the site code is arbitrarily updated to use a new rating system underwriters and agents might have access to company specific rating tables so they might have more insight at the company level   in short if there 's an equation out there being used to calculate your rate it 's probably a huge string of with some base rate additions and linear in based on factors and base rates that are n't readily publicized your best bet is to not go through the site at all and talk to a state farm agent about agency specific practices if you 're really curious about the numbers

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

at that point i was between relationships and not really looking for one so there was no spot formerly known as wet to sleep in i do n't know if she ate breakfast or not she would still be asleep when i left for the center at then off to breakfast and class    my friend who lived down the hall the voice noticed and would sometimes come over to hang out for a bit when she came over we 'd kick him out when it was time to sleep though   it was a cali king sized bed i made from two long together sheets during the winter and on the floor made my the place to hangout for my friends everyone called it the bed of every once in a while we 'd have 4 5 people sleeping in it after a weekend night   no i recall i would fall asleep first and was the big spoon i 've never been able to sleep face to face with anyone including my wife of 16 years    the arrangement came to a halt when the voice and i moved out of the grad dorm the next year for a apartment off campus came over a few times to sleep but not often because she could n't just walk across campus she had to drive and by that time i was starting to get serious with a young lady from my art classes who was the most beautiful girl i 'd ever been out with   that 's when i got a they would n't let me put one in the dorm even though i was on the ground floor i asked

do you want to split expenses of the new apartment or split your income assets equally too as for instance with a marriage where no sort of yours mine and ours are split out i 'm going to assume you have beliefs similar to me in my answer in that you desire to split expenses of the new place but do n't suddenly want to split all of your assets and income 50/50 too so here 's how i 'd approach this i am somewhat unsure of what you mean by living expenses for your flat does this mean the cost of ownership per month what it takes to not get rid of the place and no portion of this is interest mortgage to make the calculations a little simpler i 'll assume that all the money you pay out as expenses is just gone none of it remains as equity or is dis proportionally accumulating value in some other such way so you move in with your girlfriend the cost for her place the place itself taxes utilities whatever is per month so since you are both getting equal use of the place you would split this into 3946 per month for each of you that 's it well i do n't see how that really matters at all anymore than if you owned a company or stocks and bonds if you rent it out for less per month than it costs you i do n't see why your girlfriend should take any part of the loss conversely if you make more money per month than it costs you that is your investment profit the payment you get for owning the apartment and dealing with renting it out now if your girlfriend is going to partner with you in handling renting out the apartment you own and you want to look at this as an investment partnership then you should pay all expenses out of the income first and then you can split the profit if you really want one question to ask would be what if you just sold your apartment completely would you give your girlfriend have the money from the sale if not then i do n't see why you would split the investment profit from holding on to the place while this is what i recommend and would feel comfortable with personally and if the situation was reversed and it was my girlfriend that owned a place and was moving in with me ultimately this is about your personal values beliefs and relationship you are very wise to seek something that both of you will find fair and so you should discuss a proposed arrangement with your girlfriend and see if you are on the same page if you are both fine with the agreement and feel ok with it then great none of us have to like or agree with it because we are n't a part of your relationship psychologically and financially this situation seems the most reasonable to me but ymmv after some more thought and from comments i realize that it 's probably best to explore a few possibilities numerically so i 'll run a few sets of numbers which may help pick which one is right for your relationship this is approximately the same as paying her rent for getting to live with her you pay her for sharing her place splitting the expense 3946 paid to you she pays the other 3946 for her place financially it 's like being room mates you can do whatever you want with your place rent or sell hold on to it for security etc this deal makes your girlfriend financially better off by 3946 the financial advantage to you is wholly dependent on what you do with your place   this option would give you each the most financial independence which is why i like it but you might be keen on being more interdependent   which leads us to the next option here you behave as before in splitting her expenses but you include renting out your place as part of the deal let 's say you get 10k a month for it you pay the expenses on that place from the rent then you have left as profit you split the profits monthly to each of you   there 's a bit of problem here though what happens when the place is vacant do you share the full expense of the rent so she 'd actually be paying you each month while it sits open what about repairs taxes costs and credits etc   i would recommend instead what you do if you go this way to account for the apartment as an investment and do n't pay out any of the profits right away all rents stay in their own account and you pay expenses from that same account for you both it 's like it does n't exist accept it is a nice earning asset when you decide it has accumulated more than enough to pay for itself and has enough money to cover vacancy repairs etc then when you pull out money for the duration you are together you just pay it out to both of you equally you might also pull this equity out and spend it on something for both of you like a nice vacation etc something you both enjoy so you are still sharing the profits i do n't object to this and it could be a nice arrangement i would only note that this makes you have a personal relationship you live together as roommates and now you are co landlords business partners that 's a lot of types of relationships and i can tell you from personal experience each type has it 's own stresses and this sort of stress can stack or if you do n't handle it well multiply so just make sure you are both clear what sort of responsibility you are really both signing up for up front and what you 'd do if you part   combine your apartment expenses which would equal so that 's cost to each of you a month if you rent your place then whatever money you get you split and whatever costs come up repairs cleaning etc you would also split so if you get an average of 10000 a month for the apartment you each are paying living expenses of total   but notice that this is n't exactly equal either you will pay less per month than you are now and she will pay less than she was before   there 's nothing morally wrong with this or anything it 's a 100 partnership across the board yet advantage is still not equal you actually will see a larger benefit to your budget than she will but if you seek equal benefit you will have to pay a month more than she does   this sort of thing is basically the model marriage uses a pure 50/50 partnership or communal property and note that one of you will either be paying more than the other will be benefiting more than the other no matter what you do it 's impossible to balance both costs and benefits because your income and expenses are not the same going in if you go this way you 'll need to choose what is most important splitting the expenses income equally or benefiting financially equally so i say again ultimately you have to choose based upon your individual and shared values and also on just what sort of relationship and layers of commitment you want to have together you could start slow with option 1 then progress to sharing more that 's what i 'd recommend because i like the idea of developing things one layer at a time rather than jumping in head first like i have personally done in the past haha once bitten twice shy i might just be more risk averse or careful than you desire to be but that 's a personal choice   i personally believe the relationship can be far more valuable than any investment but at the same time i 'll take $ 1 over a relationship that has turned sour any day of the week this is why i suggest the more gradual careful approach to let your love bloom and grow deeper one layer at a time without the complexities of fully shared finances or investment partnership relationships are hard enough so this is why i favor trying to protect them aggressively from unnecessary complexity some favor the sink or swim model of seeking out trials and challenges while i favor the relationship as tender growing model i hope seeing these options laid out more is helpful to you and good luck to you your relationship and lastly to your investments

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

one of the of free trade is that there is now a global labor market so companies routinely review their operations and think strategically about where the company is going standard options are because the disincentives that once existed in the past are gone the need for humans to do work tariffs regulation poor infrastructure in the developing world the available supply of labor is greater and demand lower thus wages are falling in real terms think in the simplest terms in an office environment   in 1980 to make you needed a xerox machine that required a technician on site every couple of weeks to make adjustments change toner etc there was probably a local rep you called to schedule break fix now technology has replaced that copy machine with a cheap multi function device that requires no maintenance and any technical support is delivered by a person sitting in a indian call center so to answer your question the incremental money from rising prices goes to a number a places alot of it goes to oil producers and other commodity producers much of it consists of indirect costs that fulfill other mandated services when you buy something buried in that cost are things like health insurance prescription drugs and school taxes

that is called substitution of collateral and yes it can be done but only with consent of the lender the best case for this kind of maneuver is if the second house is larger and more valuable than the first another possibility is that you have two mortgages on the first house and none on the second and you want to move the second mortgage on the first house to the second one effectively making it a first mortgage in these instances the lender has a clear incentive to allow a substitution of collateral because the second one is actually better than the first one the potential problem in your case is if the second house were more expensive than the first house you could not use the sale proceeds of the first house as to buy the second house without borrowing additional money in that case a possible solution would be to go back to the lender on your first house for a larger mortgage with the proceeds of that mortgage being used to retire the earlier mortgage depending on your credit payment record etc they might be willing to do this

as other people have indicated traditional iras are tax deductable for a particular year please note though that traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free accounts meaning that you 'll have to pay taxes on any money you take out later regardless of why you 're making the withdrawal a lot of people mistakenly call them tax free which they 're not there is no such thing as a tax free retirement account really in terms of roth vs. traditional iras it 's pay now or pay later with the exception of special circumstances like this i recommend investing exclusively in roth iras for money that you expect to grow much or that you expect to produce substantial income over time just to add a few thoughts on what to actually invest in once you open your ira i strongly agree with the advice that you invest mostly in low cost mutual funds or index funds the advantage of an open ended mutual fund is that it 's easier to purchase them in odd increments and you may be able to avoid at least some purchase fees whereas with an etf you have to buy in multiples of that day 's asking price for example if you were investing $ 500 and the etf costs $ 200 per share you could only purchase 2 shares leaving $ 100 uninvested minus whatever fee your broker charged for the purchase the advantage of an etf is that it 's easy to buy or sell quickly usually when you add money to a mutual fund it 'll take a few days for it to hit your account and when you want to sell it 'll similarly take a few days for you to get your money when i buy an etf the transaction can occur almost instantly the fees can also be lower if the etf is just a passive index fund also there 's a risk with open ended mutual funds that if too many people pull money out at once the managers could be forced to sell stocks at an unfavorable price

say there are 5 people took loan of $ 100000 each those 5 people work in different jobs and have different capacity to payoff loan someone earning $ 40000 a year has higher risk to default on their payment then someone making $ a year    as bank wants to sell this cdo to investor but how would investor know what the risk factor for this cdo is this is where rating agency comes in picture they apparently look at the underlying asset and assign rating to this cdo say aaa b aa etc which give investor idea of underlying risk    problem here is rating agency gets paid by bank to rate their cdo so if a rating agency starts rating their cdo to higher risk bank will go to next agency round the corner to get better rating and agency will lose commission you can see the problem here    now if people start struggling to pay loan bank will not get money and it can not pay cdo holders if house that was worth $ 100000 when cdo was created is devalued to say $ 50000 today the underlying asset is not worth as much when cdo was sold that is what happened when market crashed in 2008 and gfc hit

robinhood seems interesting some say it 's a site with a nice ui not an investing or trading platform from investopedia 1 for now the app stays afloat for mainly two reasons first the business itself is extremely lean no physical locations a small    staff no massive public relations campaigns and only one operating    system platform to maintain robinhood also generates interest off of    unused cash deposits from user accounts according to the federal funds    rate 2 second venture capitalists such as index ventures capital    google ventures social leverage and many    others have invested more than $ 16 million in the app 3 according to barron ’s robinhood plans to implement margin trading in    2015 eventually charging 3.5 interest for the service e*trade    charges for accounts under $ 25,000 phone assisted trading will    also be available at $ 10 per trade in the future 4 originally robinhood planned to make money off of order flows a    common tactic used by discount brokerages in the to generate    revenue according to the company 's faq robinhood on the    idea because it executes orders through a clearing partner and as a    result receives little to no payment for order flow the company is    willing to return to its original plan in the future if it receives    order flows directly or begins to generate a lot of revenue from them

these days almost all risky assets move together so the most difficult criterion to match from your 4 will be not strongly correlated to the u.s. economy   however depending on how you define strongly you may want to consider the following be careful you are sort of asking for the impossible here so these will all be caveat emptor type assets edit a recent wsj article talks about what some professional investors are doing to find uncorrelated bets an emerging markets strategist for boutique brokerage knight capital group is encouraging clients to bet against israeli bonds his theory investors are so focused on europe that they are risks in the middle east such as a up in relations between israel and iran or greater conflict in egypt and syria once they wake up to those risks israeli bonds are likely to tumble mr. reasons in the meantime the investment is n't likely to be pushed one way or another by the european crisis he says

if the price of the property 1 increases a lot you will just break even on the huge expenses of home owning if the price of the property 2 increases a huge amount you will make lots of money due to the leverage if the price of the property 3 stays even you will lose a tremendous amount of money it 's much like owning a car constant expenses that 's all there is to it it 's well worth bearing in mind that property prices for your area your property need to be constantly increasing for you to merely break even note that over long periods of time prices tend to go up most anywhere but not everywhere many people basically base their thinking on that it will be ok in the long run which is fair enough i believe one huge factor is that it is enforced saving that is the number one advantage for most note too that in most all jurisdictions there are tremendous tax advantages even if it turns out to be situation 1 i.e. a waste of time you only break even note finally that there are indeed tremendous social financial advantages to having the equity it gets incredibly easy to get other loans for business or the like once you own a house this is undeniably an advantage perhaps press your husband on that one

the key to understanding where your money is going is to budget   rather than tracking your spending after the fact budgeting lets you decide up front what you want to spend your money on   this can be done with cash envelopes on paper or on excel spreadsheets however in my opinion the best most flexible and easiest way to do this is with budgeting software designed for this purpose as i explained in another answer when it comes to personal budgeting software there are two different approaches those in which you decide what to spend your money on before it is spent and those that simply show you how your money was spent after it is gone   i recommend the first approach   software designed to do this include ynab mvelopes and everydollar my personal favorite is ynab   you 'll find lots of help video tutorials and even online classes with a live teacher on ynab 's website    using one of these packages will help you manage spending whether it is done electronically or with cash   when you pay for something with a credit card you enter your purchase into the software and the software adjusts your budget as if the money is already spent even if you have n't technically paid for the purchase yet as far as strategy goes here is what i recommend   get started on one of these and set up your budget right away   assign a category to every dollar in your account   do n't worry if it is not perfect   if you find later on that you do n't have enough money in one of your categories you can move money from another category if you need to   as you work with it you 'll get better at knowing how much money you need in each category my other recommendation is this do n't wait until the end of the month to download your transactions from the bank and fit everything into categories   instead enter your spending transactions into the software manually every day as you spend   this will do two things first you 'll have the latest up to date picture of where your accounts are in your software without having to guess   second it will help you stay on top of your spending   you 'll be able to see early on if you are overspending in a particular category   ynab has a mobile app that i use quite a bit but if i do n't get a chance to enter a purchase right when i spend it i make sure to keep a receipt and enter the transaction in that evening   it only takes a couple of minutes a day and i always know how i stand financially

when people even people in the media say the stock market is up because of x or the stock market is down because of y they are often engaging in what nicolas taleb calls the narrative they see the market has moved in one direction or another they open their newspaper pick a headline that provides a plausible reason for the market to move and say oh that is why the stock market is down very rarely do statements like this actually come from research asking people why they bought or sold that day sometimes they may be right but it is usually just story telling in terms of old fashioned logic this is called the post hoc ergo proper hoc fallacy now all the points people have raised about the us deficit may be valid and there are plenty of reasons for worrying about the future of the world economy but they were all known before the s&p report which did n't really provide the markets with much new information note also that the actual bond market did n't move much after hearing the same report in fact the price of 10 year us treasury bonds actually rose a tiny bit take these simple statements about what makes the market go up or down on any given day with several of salt

i would check to see what the fee schedule is on your previous employer 's 401k depending on how it was setup the quarterly annual maintenance fee may be lower higher than your current employer another reason to rollover not rollover is that selection of funds available is better than the other plan and of course always consider rolling over your old plan into a standard custodial rollover ira where the management company gives you a selection of investment options at least look at the fees and expense ratios of your prior employer 's plan and see if anything reaches a threshold of what you consider actionable and worth your time note removed reference to self directed ira as vehicle is more complicated account type allowing for more than just stocks bonds and mutual funds not for your typical retail investor

i know of at least one case where a person was convicted of structuring   the person was depositing his own money into his own bank account and was found guilty of structuring since he made several deposits under $ 10k.   the man did nothing illegal   he just felt it was safer to make several small deposits instead of one large deposit from the article prosecutors did not offer evidence of any other motive for behavior they said at trial that should have known better the point of the law is to make sure we do n't have people who try to fool the bank federal prosecutor told last week the fact that he was trying is against the law the law states the bank has to report any transactions over $ 10 k so the government can investigate any monetary activity   of course if you make several deposits under $ 10 k you 'll also be investigated and you could actually be breaking intent of the law for depositing your own money into your own bank account

the title accepts as fact the attempted smear campaign by goldman against smith   only read the summary of the report over at bloomberg not the report itself but the argument appears to be that smith did not raise these concerns about goldman at any time while employed there except at the very end just after he had written the nyt op ed   goldman is trying to pawn off smith as a disgruntled former employee   however the fact that smith did n't get the raise he sought does not necessarily mean his assertions about the culture at goldman are incorrect   the point being that goldman has not proven smith is a fraud   they have only proven he has an axe to grind

this is the kind of scenario addressed by reddit 's /r personalfinance prime directive or i have $ x what should i do with it it follows a fairly linear for personal spending beginning with a budget and essential costs the gist of the is to cover your most immediate costs and risks first while also maximizing your benefits it sounds like you would fall somewhere around steps 1 and 3 step 2 wo n't apply since this is not pretax income if you do n't already have at least $ 1000 reserved in an emergency fund that 's a great place to start after that you 'll want to use the rest to pay down your debt your credit card debt is very high interest and should be treated as a financial emergency besides the balance of your gift you may want to throw whatever other funds you have saved beyond one month 's expenses at this problem as far as which card since you have multiple debts you 're faced with the classic choice of which payoff method to use snowball lowest balance first or avalanche highest interest rate first avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately personally since your 26 apr debt is so large and so high interest i would recommend focusing every available penny on that card until it is paid off and then never use it again again per the that means using everything left over after steps 0 2 are fulfilled

not really this just shows you might be able to fill huge orders a little less cheaply now but then somebody else gets to fill it at a better price and the hft market maker took on some risk for some profit that 's pretty much the definition of providing liquidity how is this raising prices it 's not raising prices would be if hft bought like worth of stock and just held it for some time then tried to sell it to you later at a better price but that 's just investing
