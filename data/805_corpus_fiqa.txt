i 'm not sure how this gets entered in turbotax but this income from the company should be included in the schedule c or c ez line 1 gross receipts total along with all of your 1099-misc income from your business and any other income that your business took in you do n't need a 1099 from them and the irs does n't care at least from your perspective if you got a 1099 or not in fact they probably expect you to have some income   we do n't know why the company chose not to issue 1099 forms but luckily it is n't your concern you can fill out your tax return properly without it   note this answer assumes that you did n't have any tax withheld from your checks from this company if you did have tax withheld you 'll need to insist on a 1099 to show that

the short answer to your question is yes   index funds are about the easiest and most efficient diversified way to invest your money   vanguard 's are among the cheapest and best be aware though that passive income does n't mean you do nothing for your money   in the case of investing what you are doing is bearing risk   that is you are being paid on average to put your money in a situation where you may lose money   if you keep your eye on the long term prize then when not if you sustain losses in your investment account you will have the patience to leave the money in there i 'm a little confused by your wording about increasing your salary   normally we think of index funds as a way to increase our wealth   if you are making new investments presumably you have more salary than you need right now   normal index funds will reinvest dividends automatically so you will see the value of your investments rise but will not see any cash flows per se unless you are selling your holdings   if you want actual cash coming out of your investment you can use etf 's to achieve the same type of investment and treat the dividends as a supplement to your income   note however that some gains in your etf will be in the form of capital gains and some will be dividends   think more like 2 year per in dividend payments and the rest in capital gains if your objective is to save for retirement please consider investing through an ira roth ira or through your 401(k   no need to give uncle sam a gift from your hard earned money

you are young so you have time on your side this allows you to invest in more aggressive investments i would do the following 1 contribute at least what your company is willing to match on your 401k if your company offers a roth 401k use that instead of the normal 401k when this becomes available to you 2 open a roth ira contribute the maximum to this account 3 live below your means setup a budget and try and save invest a minimum of 50 of your salary do not get used to spending more money with each bonus or salary increase a minimum of 75 of it should go toward your savings investment this will keep you from rapidly increasing your spending budget   3 invest in real estate this could be its own post being young and not too far out of college you have probably been moving every year and have not accumulated so much stuff that it makes moving difficult i would utilize your fha loan slot to buy a multifamily property 2 4 units for your first property using only 3.5 down payment you can put more down if you like learn how to analyze properties first and find a great realtor mentor then i would continue as a investor where you move every year into a new owner occupied property and turn the previous into a rental this allows you to put 3 5 down payment of properties that you would otherwise have to put 20 25 and since you are young you can afford the risk you should check out this article website as it is very informative and can show you the returns that you could earn young professional good luck i am in a very similar situation

you can get no load annuities through some no load financial companies like vanguard so to start with i 'd see how what she is being offered compares with something that comes free of a sales load i 'd also question that fixed rate seems pretty impossible to me which makes me think there is some catch or gotcha that we are not seeing that either brings down that rate or makes it delusional they are kidding themselves or deceptive in some way   in any case it 's setting off my too good to be true alarm at full volume along with the shark attack alarm as well i would strongly suspect the advisor is advising the product that makes the most money for him not what is in your mother 's best interest   a fixed annuity is an insurance product not a security because the insurance company must credit the annuity holder ’s account with the specified interest rate for the contractually stipulated time period regardless of market fluctuations in actual interest rates it is the insurance company that bears the investment risk which it does by investing the annuity holder ’s purchase proceeds in fixed income instruments that the company hopes will provide sufficient return to fulfill its contractual representations to the holder   this is why there is no prospectus it 's not a security they are not required to provide one by sec because the risk is entirely with the company obviously as pointed out in the comments the company could easily go out of business especially of they sell a lot of these and ca n't find a way to get that kind of return on the invested money   now ask yourself if i was the insurance company would i be comfortable guaranteeing that level of return over that much time if i intend to make a profit from it pay sales and stay in business    in terms of will they stay in business i 'd have a hard look at their ratings and go compare where that is on the total range for am best they are lowest secure rating next thing down is in the vulnerable category and standard and poors 4 places down from their best rating next thing down is marginal followed by poor    you might also want to see if you can get any idea of historical ratings is this company 's ratings falling or rising    personally for the amount of money involved i 'd want a company with much higher ratings than these guys   then maybe someone could say no risk but with those ratings   an no i do n't think so btw i 'd check over what this um sorry that 's not fair to clowns is recommending she do with her own funds as well   for example is he recommending she take something that is already tax sheltered such as an ira and investing the stuff inside that in an annuity kind of pointless to double shelter the money or lock it up for a period of time when she may be required to make withdrawals make sure you do n't see something there that is actually against what is in her best interest and is only done to make him a comission

i gift my daughter stock worth $ 1000 no tax issue she sells it for $ 2000 and has a taxable gain of $ 1000 that shows up on her return   yes you need to find out the date of the gift as that is the date you value the fund for cost basis the $ 3500 is n't a concern as the gift seems to have been given well before that it 's a long term capital gain when you sell it   and in a annoying aspect of our code the dividends get added to basis each year as you were paying tax on the dividend whether or not you actually received it depending on the level of dividends your basis may very well be as high as the $ 6500 current value   pls ask if anything here needs clarification

as an insider who experienced both i can confirm walmart 's culture is very rough the executives i have met just act like their soul was stolen there s no real interest in the company 's future or its people it feels like nobody really cares   meanwhile at amazon the company has taken the relatively new silicon valley business model to heart amazon not only invests in expansion and growth but it invests significantly in its personnel there are millions of dollars rolling around being invested in employee development and growth through programs like their tuition assistance and employee assistance amazon shows its employees that the company cares by investing in them and that makes a huge difference in employee retention and productivity i know people who have worked at one warehouse for over 10 years and never considered leaving because the company makes them feel wanted that culture is built from the very top all the way to the lowest supervisor

lots of questions in general no market capitalization and equity represent 2 different things   equity first the equity of a firm is the value of the assets what it owns less its liabilities what it owes and consists broadly of two components share capital what the firm gets when it sells to investors as part of an ipo or subsequent share issue and retained earnings what the firm has as a result of making profits and not paying them out as dividends this is the theoretical liquidation value of the firm what it is worth if it stops trading sells all its assets and pays all its debts market capitalization is the current value of the future cash flow of the firm as perceived by the market the value today of all the dividends that the firm will pay in the future for as long as it exists this is the theoretical going concern value of the firm what it is worth as a functioning business in general market capitalization is bigger than equity if it is n't the firm is worth more as scrap than as an operating business um no if you do n't have any shares then you are by definition not an owner having shares is what makes you an owner what i think you mean is is it possible for the owner(s of a private company to sell all of its shares when it goes public the answer is yes it is uncommon for a start up owner to do this but it is standard practice for corporate raiders who buy failing companies take them private restructure them and then take them public again they have done their job and they are not interested in maintaining an ownership stake nope see above and below not at all equity is an accounting construct and market capitalization is about market sentiment consider the following hypothetical firm it has $ 1 m in equity it makes $ 4 m in profit and will do for the foreseeable future it pays all of that $ 4 m out as dividends if we work on a simple roi of 10 then this firm is worth $ 40 m dollars way more than its equity

i had a similar situation when i was in college the difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history the dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork i told them that i would not pay that and i dropped the car off at the lot with a letter the sale they were n't happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a $ 1000 discount from the previously agreed upon purchase price what i learned through that experience is that i did n't do a good enough job of negotiating the original price i would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time if the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it he owes nothing further if the dealer has not cashed the check he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer this only works if your son keeps his nerve and is willing to walk away from the car

as joetaxpayer says it 's a very rare circumstance where an early 401(k withdrawal actually makes any real economic sense your statements that one year 's salary for you is $ 60 k and the combination of your spouse 's income and yours puts you into the highest income tax bracket together lead to the conclusion that your spouse 's income is considerably higher than yours if this income will continue past your death e.g. you two are not in a joint venture that will collapse when you pass away because she can not do the work by herself then it is very definitely to your joint advantage to leave your money in a tax deferred account for as long as possible her income should be enough to cover the mortgage payments   also rather than take the money out and paying taxes at a high rate right now your   spouse can roll over the 401k money into an ira and withdraw only small amounts per year paying taxes spread over the years rather than in a lump sum

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

you have actually asked several questions so i think what i 'll do is give you an intuition about risk neutral pricing to get you started   then i think the answer to many of your questions will become clear physical probability there is some probability of every event out there actually occurring including the price of a stock going up   that 's what we call the physical probability   it 's very intuitive but not directly useful for finding the price of something because price is not the weighted average of future outcomes    for example if you have a stock that is highly correlated with the market and has 50 chance of being worth $ 20 dollars tomorrow and a 50 chance of being worth $ 10 it 's value today is not $ 15   it will be worth less because it 's a risky stock and must earn a premium   when you are dealing with physical probabilities if you want to compute value you have to take the probability weighted average of all the prices it could have tomorrow and then add in some kind of compensation for risk which may be hard to compute risk neutral probability finance theory has shown that instead of computing values this way we can embed risk compensation into our probabilities   that is we can create a new set up probabilities by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes downward and increasing the probability of bad market outcomes   this may sound crazy because these probabilities are no longer physical but it has the desirable property that we then use this set of probabilities to price of every asset out there all of them equity options bonds savings accounts etc   we call these adjusted probabilities that risk neutral probabilities   when i say price i mean that you can multiply every outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate to find its correct price     to be clear we have changed the probability of the market going up and down not our probability of a particular stock moving independent of the market   because moves that are independent of the market do not affect prices we do n't have to adjust the probabilities of them happening in order to get risk neutral probabilities anyway the best way to think of risk neutral probabilities is as a set of bogus probabilities that consistently give the correct price of every asset in the economy without having to add a risk premium if we just take the risk neutral probability weighted average of all outcomes and discount at the risk free rate we get the price   very handy if you have them risk neutral pricing we ca n't get risk neutral probabilities from research about how likely a stock is to actually go up or down   that would be the physical probability   instead we can figure out the risk neutral probabilities from prices if a stock has only two possible prices tomorrow u and d and the risk neutral probability of u is q then price = + the exponential there is just discounting by the risk free rate   this is the beginning of the equations you have mentioned   the main thing to remember is that q is not the physical probability it 's the risk neutral one   i ca n't emphasize that enough   if you have what u and d can be then there is only one unknown in that equation q. that means you can look at the stock price and solve for the risk neutral probability of the stock going up    the reason this is useful is that you can same risk neutral probability to price the associated option   in the case of the option you do n't know its price today yet but you do know how much money it will be worth if the stock moves up or down   use those values and the risk neutral probability you computed from the stock to compute the option 's price   that 's what 's going on here   to remember the same risk neutral probability measure prices everything out there   that is if you choose an asset multiply each possibly outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate you get its price   in general we use prices of things we know to infer things about the risk neutral probability measure in order to get prices we do not know

once upon a time not all that long ago british cheques used to say something like pay to the order of or bearer the sum of   emphasis added and could be cashed by anyone unless the cheque writer drew two parallel lines in the upper left corner of the cheque these lines converted the instrument into a crossed cheque which could only be deposited into a bank account of the payee a bearer of the cheque could not walk into the bank and out with the cash equivalent perhaps british banks no longer use this styling indian banks still do but if that cheque for 60k is not a crossed cheque it better be sent securely with lots of insurance an cheque is the same as cash since it can be cashed by anyone that being said i am with in thinking that all this is just a scam with the op mug being asked to send 3600 bucks to girlfriend   scammer to cover the cost of sending the check with full insurance and when the check arrives and is deposited by op into his bank it will turn out to be a dud and girlfriend will be long gone   the description of how the girlfriend signed a contract for 90k and received 60k of this amount upfront but in the form of a check payable to boyfriend op reeks of scam is this scenario realistic   in the past i   have received offers usually from nigeria from women wanting to be my girlfriend and i am sure that such offers will continue to come in the future

in the us stocks are listed on one exchange but can be traded on multiple venues   you need to confirm exactly what your data is showing a trades on the primary listed exchange or b trades made at any venue also the trade condition codes are important   only certain trade condition codes contribute towards the day 's open high low close and some others only contribute towards the volume data   the consolidated tape association is very clear on which trades should contribute towards each value but some vendors have their own interpretation or just simply an erroneous interpretation of the specifications it may surprise you to find that the majority of trading volume for many stocks is not on their primary listed exchange   for example on 2 mar 2015 nasdaq aapl traded a total volume across all venues was shares but trading on nasdaq itself was shares trades can be cancelled   some data vendors do not modify their data to reflect these busted trades    some data vendors also snapshot their feed at a particular point in time of the data   some exchanges can provide data mainly corrections 4 5 hours after the closing bell   by the data too early and throwing away any subsequent data is a typical cause of data discrepancies    some data vendors also round prices volumes but stocks do n't just trade to two decimal places so you may well be comparing two different sets of trades with their own specific inclusion rules against the same stock   you need to confirm with your data sources exactly how they do things disclosure premium data is an end of day daily data vendor

if your primary goal is no minimized fees there are 3 general options as i see it   based on the fact that you want some risk interest only investments would not be great consider 2 interest equals only $ 1,500 annually and since the trust can only distribute income that may be limited based on the fact that you seem to have some hesitation on risk and also limited personal time able to govern the trust which is understandable i would say keep your investment mix simple by this i mean creating a specific portfolio may seem desirable but could also become a headache and in my opinion not desirable for a trust executor   you did n't get into the personal situation but i assume you have a family close connection to a young person and are executor of a trust set up on someone 's death that not be the case for you but given that you are asking for advice rather than speaking with those involved i assume it is similar enough for this to be applicable you do n't want to set yourself up to feel emotionally responsible for taking on too much risk impacting the 's life negatively therefore investing in a few limited index funds seems to match what you 're looking for in terms of risk reward and time required one final consideration if you want to maximize annual distributions to the 's consider that you may be best served by seeking high dividend paying stock although again probably do n't do this on a stock by stock basis unless you can commit the time to fully manage it returns in the form of stock increases are good but they will not immediately provide income that the trust can distribute if you also wish to grow the corpus of the trust then stock growth is okay but if you want to maximize immediate distributions you need to focus on returns through income dividends interest rather than returns through value increase

you also may want to consider how this interacts with the stepped up basis of estates   if you never sell the stock and it passes to your heirs with your estate under current tax law the basis will increase from the purchase price to the market price at the time of transfer    in a comment you proposed    thinking more deeply though i am a little skeptical that it 's a free lunch say i buy stock a a computer manufacturer at $ 100 which i intend to hold long term it ends up falling to $ 80 and the robo advisor sells it for tax loss harvesting buying stock b a similar computer manufacturer as a replacement so i benefit from realizing those losses however say both stocks then rise by 50 over 3 years at this point selling b gives me more capital gains tax than if i had held a through the losses since a 's rise from 80 back to 100 would have been free for me since i purchased at 100 and then later thought   although thinking even more sorry thinking out loud here i guess i still come out ahead on taxes since i was able to deduct the $ 20 loss on a against ordinary income and while i pay extra capital gains on b that 's a lower tax rate so the free lunch is $ of tax bracket capital gains rates that 's true   and in addition to that if you never sell b which continues to rise to $ 200 was last at $ 120 after a 50 increase from $ 80 the basis steps up to $ 200 on transfer to your heirs    of course your estate may have to pay a 40 tax on the $ 200 before transferring the shares to your heirs   so this is n't exactly a free lunch either   but you have to pay that 40 tax regardless of the form in which the money is held   cash real estate stocks whatever   whether you have a large or small capital gain on the stock is irrelevant to the estate tax    this type of planning may not matter to you personally but it is another aspect of what wealth management can impact

i assume the op is the us and that he is like most people a cash basis tax payer and not an accrual basis tax payer suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was reported   as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms but the corresponding income   tax was not withheld   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 nor is the company entitled to withhold tax on this income for 2010 and 2011 at this time the tax on that income has already been paid by the op directly to the irs and the company has nothing to do with the matter anymore suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was not reported as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 should the op have declared the value of the rental of the unit as additional income from his employer that was not reported on the w-2 form and paid taxes   on that money possibly but it would be reasonable to argue that the op did nothing wrong other than not checking his w-2 form carefully he simply assumed the income numbers included the value of the rental and copied whatever the company issued w-2 form said onto his 1040 form at least as   of now there is no reason for the irs to question his 2010 and 2011 returns because the numbers reported to the irs on copy a of the w-2 forms match the numbers reported by the op on his tax returns     my guess is that the company discovered that it had not actually declared the value of the rental payments on the op 's w-2 forms for 2010 and 2011 and now wants to include this amount as income on subsequent w-2 forms now reporting a lump sum benefit of $ 38 k but no actual cash   would have caused a huge amount of income tax to need to be withheld and the op 's next couple of paychecks might well have had zero take home pay as all the money was going towards this tax withholding instead the company is saying that it will report the $ 38 k as income in 78 equal installments weekly paychecks over 18 months   and withhold $ 150 as the tax due on each installment if it does not already do so it will likely also include the value of the current rent as a benefit and withhold tax on that too so the op 's take home pay will reduce by $ 150 at least and maybe more if the current rental payments also start appearing on the paychecks and tax is withheld from them too i will not express an opinion on the legality of the company withholding an additional $ 150 as tax from the op 's paycheck but will suggest that the solution proposed by the company have the money appear as taxable benefits over a period have tax withheld and declare the income on your   2012 2013 and 2014 returns is far more beneficial to the op than the company declaring to the irs that it made a   mistake on the 2010 and 2011 w-2 's issued to the op and that the actual income paid was higher not only will the op have to file amended returns for 2010 and 2011 but the company will need to amend its tax returns too in summary the op needs to know that he will have to pay taxes on the value of the waived rental payments    for 2010 and 2011 the company 's mistake in not declaring this as income to the op    for 2010 and 2011 does not absolve him of the responsibility    for paying the taxes what the company is proposing is a very reasonable solution to the    problem of recovering from the mistake the alternative as points out is to amend    your 2010 and 2011 federal and state tax returns to declare the    value of the rental during those years as additional income    and pay taxes and possibly penalties on the additional    amount due this takes the company completely out of the picture    but does require a lot more work and a lot more cash now rather    than in the future

nothing necessarily has to benefit right now what primarily drives demand for gold is its perceived use as a hedge against the inflation of fiat currency i.e. when inflation strikes the price of gold goes up rapidly thus for a given currency gold decreasing in price is almost always a signal that the currency is increasing in value however it may be that at some point in time people everywhere just decide that gold is no longer worth using as an inflation hedge and thus the price collapses simply because demand collapsed no corresponding benefit

in your particular condition could buy the condo with cash then get your mortgage on your next house with less than 20 down i.e. with mortgage insurance but it would still be an owner occupied loan   if you hate the mortgage insurance you could save up and refi it when you have 20 available including the initial down payment you made i.e. 80 ltv ratio total   or perhaps during the time you live in the condo you can save up to reach the 20 down for the new house   or perhaps you can just rent somewhere then get into the house for 20 down and while there save up and eventually buy a condo in cash later   or perhaps buy the condo for 50 down non owner occupied mortgage ianal but some things that may come in handy you do n't have to occupy your second residence owner occupied mortgage for 60 days after closing on it   so could purchase it at month 10 i suppose   in terms of locking down mortgage rates you could do that up to 3 months before that even so i 've heard    it 's not immediately clear if rent backs could extend the 60 day intent to occupy or if so by how long 1 month might be ok but 2 dunno also you could just buy one or the other or both of your mortgages as a 20 down conventional non owner occupied mortgage and generate leeway there ex buy the home as non owner occupied and rent it out until your year is up though non owner occupied mortgage have worse interest rates so that 's not as appealing   or buy one as a secondary residency mortgage   consult your loan officer there they like to see like geographic distance between primary and secondary residences i 've heard if it 's hud fha mortgage the owner occupancy agreement you will sign is that you will continue to occupy the property as my primary residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy unless extenuating circumstances arise which are beyond my control ref i.e. you plan on living in it for a year so you 're kind of stuck in your case   maybe you 'd want to occupy it as quickly as possible initially to make the year up more quickly apparently you can also request the lender to agree to arbitrarily rescind the owner occupancy aspect of the mortgage half way through though i 'd imagine you need some sort of excuse to convince them   might not hurt to ask

two parties will agree to pay each other 's interest obligations this is generally for one of two reasons    one party wishes to swap a fixed interest rate eg coupons on a bond for a floating interest rate eg payments on a loan if their counterparty wishes the opposite and the rates are acceptable to both they will agree to swap their obligations   there are two firms based in countries a and b. each firm has a branch in the other 's country and these branches each have a loan denominated in that other countries currency to reduce each firm 's exposure to fx risk they can swap their obligations so a will pay interest on b 's loan which is in a 's currency and b on a 's loan which is in b 's currency   edit removed bracket

yes using debt appropriately is a huge part of what 's called optimal capital structure theory in the finance world debt is generally cheaper than equity financing due to the tax deductibility of interest and using it appropriately can really juice the profitability of a business as long as the rate of return on equity in the business exceeds the interest rate on the debt

yes many people operate accounts in usa from outside usa you need a brokerage account opened in the name of your sister and then her username and password remember that brokerages may check the location of login and may ask security questions before login so when your sister opens her account please get the security questions also note that usa markets open 7.00 pm or 8.00 pm ist depending on daylight savings in usa so this means when they close at 4:00 pm et it will be or am in india this means it will affect your sleeping hours if you intend to day trade also understand that there are some day trading restrictions and balances associate normally brokerages need 25,000 $ for you to be a day trader finally cfa is not a qualification to be a trader and desire to become a trader does n't make one a trader to give an analogy just because you want to be a does n't make you one it needs a lot of practice and discipline also since in bangladesh you will always convert the usa amount to currency and think of profits and losses in those terms this might actually be bad

it is not a better world when all we 've done is trade one set of victims for another    there is nothing fair about forcing one citizen to do what the mob thinks they should   life liberty and the of happiness and all that does not include being able to force other people to do what you want with their property   this is theft by any reasonable definition   the only civil rights that are ever morally justified are before the law as a   your government should treat all its citizens equally   there is no sense in which this ought to translate to the private sector except under voluntary conditions not by the state shoving a gun in your ear and forcing you to do so

this comment is too long to put in comments sorry i suggest you also do a dry run of your taxes with the rental as part of it when you rent a house you take depreciation each year this means that even if you are breaking even the rent paying the mortgage property tax etc you may still show a tax loss in which case planning and knowing this might suggest you adjust your withholding so instead of a large refund you get better cash flow each month   also pull a copy of schedule e and the instructions you 'll be wiser for having read them   last if you have decent equity in the existing house it may pay to refinance to save a bit there or even pull some cash out when you buy the new one you want to be in the best position you can be and not risk cutting it too close

first check with your lender to see if the terms of the loan allow early payoff   if you are able to payoff early without penalty with the numbers you are posting i would hesitate to refinance this is simply because if you actually do pay 5k month on this loan you will have it paid off so quickly that refinancing will probably not save you much money back of the napkin math at 5k month has you paying 60k pounds a year which will payoff in about 5 years   even if you can afford 5k month i would recommend not paying extra on this debt ahead of other high interest debt or saving in a tax advantaged retirement account if these other things are being taken care of and you have liquid assets cash for emergencies i would recommend paying off the mortgage without refinancing

i 've had stock options at two different jobs    if you are not getting a significant ownership stake but rather just a portion of options as incentive to come work there i would value them at $ 0     if you get the same salary and benefits but no stock options at another company and you like the other company better i 'd go to the other company i say this because there are so many legal changes that seem to take value from you that you might as well not consider the options in your debate that being said the most important question i 'd want to know is what incentive does the company have to going public or getting bought     if the company is majority owned by investors the stock options are likely to be worth something if you wait long enough    you are essentially following someone else 's bet     if the company is owned by 2 or 3 individuals who want to make lots of money they may or may not decide to sell or go public

you can become an activist share holder with as little as one share depending on your strategy an example of this was excellent name vs tesco a huge supermarket think walmart he purchased one share which gave him the right to table a resolution at the agm then used the media to beat tesco into submission over his particular issue however very few of the institution share holders think large banks pension funds insurance companies voted in favor so he failed miserably but tesco later slightly through fear of bad press also carl icahn is pretty well noted for doing things like this   regarding the amount of money you would need to raise a hell of a lot to buy enough shares to have anything like enough of a block to influence the company directly but to attend the agm ask questions and generally be a pain in the ass you only need modest amount of shares in some cases just one share

then we do agree in a sense pensions are an in the modern economy and likely were never a good idea that said i do not agree with putting those owed and promised pensions behind other creditors you would not bring down the credit system you would simply kill what is left of the seriously broken pensions system and punish any company that was fool enough to play games with their pension system    all that said i am not against a bankruptcy court discharging pensions and saying tough to the employees i just want that consideration by the court to happen when whatever is left of the cash pile is still big enough to matter to the pensioners   if you are a company dumb enough to operate such a system today i see no reason why your creditors should not be aware of the promised debt load you carry that is bound up in your employees and take it into account does it make credit more expensive for them it better

firstly you should yourself with your options for your pension fund they changed as of 6th april 2015 so it 's all quite new the government 's guidance on it is here if you have n't already taken a tax free lump sum from your pension fund you can take up to 25 totally tax free immediately that makes getting a house for 40 k very accessible beyond the 25 you can take any of it out whenever you want access drawdown or lump sum payment depending on whether you take the 25 out up front or not that 'll be taxed as if you earned it as income so if you did n't have any other income you can take another £ without tax this tax year and then another £ or whatever the allowance goes up to next tax year and so on above that you 'd have to pay 20 tax until you reach the higher rate tax threshold at about £ 40k year you say you do have other income so you 'll have to take that into account as well when calculating what tax you 'd have to pay if you 've reached state pension age that will add some more income of course or as you suggest you can buy an annuity you can do that with some or all of the money and you can still take the 25 tax free first if you do buy an annuity the income from it will all be taxed but again your personal allowance will apply essentially an annuity is the least risky option particularly if you get one that is with inflation with inflation makes the initial income even lower but protects you against cost of living rises as you get older in exchange for avoiding that risk you probably lose out on average compared to some more risky options you might choose to get an annuity large enough to cover your basic needs and take more chances with the rest

fair statement but two points    1 slow change in politics is one of the primary intentions of the design of our system from the beginning   2 these reference points are all over the map pairing economic trends with wars makes things seem more drastic than they are we all knew from the beginning and other regulations were n't going to change shit the reality is that the market is back to all time highs we 're up something like ~12 already this year alone    beyond that i do n't agree with using the market as a proxy specifically for the reason that while the market is crushing it us average joes do n't feel that the more important metric would be incomes and net worth of the middle class which according to buffet is at all time historical highs though i 'm not sure i agree with that either

the fact you are asking this question the number of up votes the real cause of the banking crisis     answers which mention that shareholders will fire a public company board are on the bottom it is obvious that a company owners are interested in company value and should have direct and easy impact on a directors board if management does n't increase shareholders wealth   with large number of passive shareholders and current stock market system that impact is very limited hence your question   so bank directors upper management are n't that interested in company value they are mostly interested in theirs bonuses their wealth increase not shareholders and that 's the real problem of capitalism public companies slowly drift to function like companies in former socialistic countries these is no owner everything is owned by a nation

is this true though i mean say if you increase taxes for the wealthy to 50 you 'll end up with the state that certainly has significantly more money but the trouble is the state has n't been very good at spending it look at the kind of stuff they get up to with the cash they have now they fight wars build massive and involve themselves where it 's none of their business do you really want them to have more money i 'd be less concerned if they proposed higher taxes for stuff like basic income but i do n't see higher taxes just by themselves as really being helpful

modigliani miller theorem   the modigliani miller theorem of modigliani merton miller is a theorem on capital structure arguably forming the basis for modern thinking on capital structure the basic theorem states that in the absence of taxes bankruptcy costs agency costs and asymmetric information and in an efficient market the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed since the value of the firm depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt the modigliani miller theorem is often called the capital structure irrelevance principle   the key modigliani miller theorem was developed in a world without taxes     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r finance about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

the all index consists of the 500 largest companies by market capitalisation listed on the australia stock exchange   each stock in the all index is given a weighting based on its market capitalisation as the price of the stocks within the all index change so does the points on the index itself   the index is more sensitive to changes in the larger stocks due to their larger weighting in the index example if a company has a weighting of 10 and its price goes up by 10 and all other stocks in the index do n't go up or down then this will cause the all index to go up by 1 10 of 10

welcome to personal finance and money this answer will depend a lot on what is most important to the buyer for example whether it is important to always be in a newer car to save money or strike a balance between the two there are trade offs and i do n't think there is one right answer for all circumstances leasing leasing does make financial sense for at least two types of people i 'm aware of the company i work for provides company cars to sales executives which we lease we lease because it would n't be appropriate for a salesperson to meet a client in a car that clearly appears used similarly i know people who value being in a newer car all the time and for them leasing makes more financial sense then buying a new car every 2 3 years and selling their old car which is now 2 3 years old and has depreciated significantly they understand that they are paying more to always be able to be in a newer car i used to work with a manager who every time the new model of the car he owned came out would see the car and buy it on the spot even though he already owned last year 's model and he did n't need two cars he just could n't help himself he felt he had to have the new model it 's no use about how he should learn to save money by just being content with what he had in reality if he is going to buy the new model every year no matter what he should lease rather than buy from my experience i would only recommend leasing if you would otherwise be buying a new car on a regular basis and the lease would be less expensive this is probably the most cost effective way to maintain the highest possible quality but would cost much more than buying and holding a new car or buying a value used car i do n't see reliability as much of a factor here since the seller will have a very good idea of how much maintenance will cost but you will pay a premium to be able to pay a fixed cost for maintenance instead of risking a worse than average experience buying new according to edmunds and only a relatively small number of people are ever in the market for a new car at a given point in time while you do pay quite a bit more to own a brand new car instead of the same car that is 2 3 years old there are several reasons i 'm aware of why people buy new cars number 4 is probably the biggest reason and many people are willing to pay for the certainty of knowing that the miles are correct the parts are new the car is in good working condition etc additionally some makes of cars have much higher resale values than others such as meaning that there is n't as large of a drop in price between a new car and a used car many people consider buying a new car the best way to ensure they get the best reliability since they know the initial condition of the car and can care for it meticulously from that point on this can especially make sense when the buyer intends to keep the car for the like of the car as the buyer will then benefit from having no car payments once it is paid off buying used buying a used car is the most affordable option but for a given quality of car the reliability can be a significant potential pitfall it can be very difficult for a non professional to tell whether they are getting a good value additionally it is hard for an owner who wants to sell a used car in excellent condition to get the true value of the car and much easier for an unscrupulous seller to to get the market price by selling to an unaware buyer the lemons problem in economics you could buy an inspected car with a limited warranty from a retail seller like carmax or a dealership but you often pay a significant premium that cancels out much of the biggest reason to buy used saving money however there is an opportunity to save money when buying used if you 're willing to compromise on the condition of the car if you do n't care whether a car has hail damage for example or if you are able to wait until you find a motivated distressed seller who needs to sell quickly and is willing to sell at a discount if cost is your primary priority buying a used car is likely the best option but i would recommend the following in all circumstances if the seller is n't willing to offer both of these i would walk away when buying used you will also need to consider maintenance which will vary significantly based on the make and model of the car as well as the condition which is another risk you need to be willing to take on if you choose to buy used

there are good reasons to not go the cash route here see jay 's answer if one insists however at 30 k€ anti money laundering regulations have to be considered and are not mentioned by the existing answers so far depositing amounts larger than 10 k€ will trigger questions about the source of the money to fight tax evasion and organized crime splitting the amount may still trigger the process so prepare good proof concerning the origin of that money and a paper trail that shows it is legal money and that it has been taxed already   i.e. the latest anti money laundering directive is supposed to be implemented by national laws thus including spain the european union fourth anti money laundering directive is the most sweeping aml legislation in europe in several years on 25 june 2015 the eu fourth directive was enacted which replaces the previous third directive with a two year window for implementation all eu member states must be compliant with the new mandates by 26 june 2017 source

if financial modelling projections and market research were effective enough that they could predict with certainty what the price would do tomorrow then everyone would use those techniques buy now and make relatively risk free profit tomorrow though right the point of an efficient market is that the price at any particular point in time incorporates all of the information available to the market at that moment given that the price should be just as likely to go up tomorrow as go down    whether it 's reasonable to assume that the market is efficient is another question at the very least though i think it 's reasonable to assume that people armchair investing at home do n't have access to information that professional investors do n't

there 's a few layers to the momentum theory discussed in that book but speaking in general terms i can answer the following kind of assuming you understand that historically the nasdaq has seen a little more volatility than the s&p. and more importantly that it tends to track the tech sector more than the general economy   thus the pitfall is that it is heavily weighted towards and often tracks the performance of a few stocks including apple google alphabet microsoft amazon intel and   it could be argued this is counter intuitive to the general strategy you are trying to employ this could be tougher to justify   the reason it is potentially not a great idea has less to do with the fact that gold has factors other than just risk on off and inflation that affect its price even though it does but more to do with the fact that it is harder to own gold and move in and out of positions efficiently than it is a bond index fund    for example consider buying physical gold   to do so you have to spend some time evaluating the purchase you are usually paying a slight premium above the spot price to purchase it and you should usually also have some form of security or insurance for it   so it has additional costs   possibly worth it as part of a long term investment strategy if you believe gold will appreciate over a decade but not so much if you are holding it for as little as a few weeks and constantly moving in and out of the position over the year the same is true to some extent of investing in gold in the form of an etf   at least a portion of their gold comes from paper or futures contracts which must be rolled every month   this creates a slight inefficiency   while possibly not a deal breaker it would not be as attractive to someone trading on momentum versus fundamentals in my opinion in the end though i think all strategies are adaptable   and if you feel gold will be the big mover this year and want to use it as your risk hedge who am i or anyone else to tell you that you should n't

if you do n't want to take any risk and you want your money to be liquid then the best place to invest such money is in an insured bank deposit such as a high interest savings account however you are n't likely to find a savings account interest rate that comes close to that charged by your mortgage so the better decision from a numbers perspective is to pay down more on your mortgage or other debt paying down your debt has almost no risk but has a better payoff than simply saving the money in a bank account however if you choose to pay down more debt i suggest you still keep aside enough cash to have an adequate emergency fund   since you want safety and liquidity do n't expect high returns from such money

the main reasons are that investment are deducted from your gross income and earnings are not taxed until withdrawal this applies to both traditional iras and 401ks roth accounts have different rules but valuable benefits my effective income tax rate is around 35 this means that for every $ 1000 i earn in wage i only get to keep $ 650 since my 401 k contributions are deferred reductions from my income i can invest 35 more money into my 401 k than i would be able to invest in a non tax advantaged account where i can invest $ 1000 into my 401 k i would only be able to invest $ 650 into a non advantaged account with the same wages if i put $ 650 into an account yielding 10 then my one year return on my income is $ 65 the 10 return on my $ 1000 is $ 100 compared to what i would have been able to take home in the first place this makes my roi $ = 15.3 interest earned in non advantaged accounts incurs taxes every year interest earned in advantaged accounts does not incur taxes until withdrawn compounding 10 annually for 20 years is significantly more than 6.5 compounded annually for 20 years imagine 10 on a 1000 investment with no additional cash flows over 20 year the result is $ or imagine your income tax rate does not reduce below 35 your after tax return is or return now imagine you pay taxes every year on 10 take so your take annually is only 6.5 now over 20 years you have $ but you 've already paid all taxes on this and your return is you have earned 24 more money because taxes were deferred until withdrawal edit some info for the commenters your take home from the investment is $ because you have paid your taxes every year on the earnings now with the tax deferred until withdrawal you then owe 35 tax on the withdrawal so you keep = $ $ versus $ means you have made an additional $ or 28 from the compounding against tax advantaged earnings but matthew you say annual proceeds from your investments are not taxed at your income tax rate this is true for now but the political winds are pushing this direction however even if you use a reduced rate in the first situation let 's say 30 instead of 35 if you 're a california resident then the effect is $ rather than $ less of a gain but still a gain in fact your capital gains rate would have to be as low as 22 to even this difference out versus a 35 income tax rate and remember that this assumes you 're in the same bracket at retirement which more people are not you may also note that i used $ 1000 as the principle in both calculations this was intentional to show the effects of compounding the taxable earnings alone if you replace the taxable principle with $ 650 instead of $ 1000 then the effect is even more pronounced and only balanced out if your capital gains rate is actually zero

is it true that you can not amend a tax return to include both a    futures loss carry back and a schedule c at the same time no it is not true you can include all the changes necessary in a single amended return attaching statement explaining each of the changes however you 're talking about two different kinds of changes futures loss is a sec and not a correction of an error adding schedule c would be a correction of an error i 'm guessing your cpa wants to separate the two kinds to avoid the situation where the irs refuses to accept your correction of an error and by the way also does n't accept the sec on the same return or the cpa just wants to charge you twice for amendments

yes and there are almost no checks no pun intended on people pulling money from your account using a routing number it is an extremely insecure system if you want a real halloween scare read this article easy check fraud technique draws scrutiny unfortunately you just have to live with it if you are curious why this loophole is allowed to continue consider how hard it is to close it without undermining the convenience of checks short of you going to the bank with each person you write a check to and showing id to validate the transaction i do n't see how you could continue to use a negotiable instrument like this without such a security hole   the ultimate answer is going to have to be replacing checks with other means of payment

in practice it would not work if you put a bid in that was really out of line even if it got filled the exchange would reverse it   other than that it really depends on what the current bid ask spread it and what volume its trading as well as how the market feels say the current bid is 11 and you put an order in with bid 11.5 it would soak up all the orders on the market up to the volume your buying but once your order is filled the market will be determined by what the next order 's bid ask is it might stay where you moved it too if others feels that s a fair price but if every other order on the market is still at 11 then the price is nt gon na move   unless your a market maker you could not realistically affect the price

it is important to first understand that true causation of share price may not relate to historical correlation just like with scientific experiments correlation does not imply causation but we use stock price correlation to attempt to infer causation where it is reasonable to do so and to do that you need to understand that prices change for many reasons some company specific some industry specific some market specific companies in the same industry may correlate when that industry goes up or down companies with the same market may correlate when that market goes up or down in general in most industries it is reasonable to assume that competitor companies have stocks which strongly correlate positively with each other to the extent that they do the same thing   for a simple example consider three resource companies oil ltd. 100 of its assets relate to oil oil and iron inc. 50 of its value relates to oil 50 to iron and iron and copper ltd. 50 of its value relates to iron 50 to copper for each of these companies there are many things which affect value but one could naively simplify things by saying value of a resource company is defined by the expected future volume of goods mined drilled the expected resource price less all fixed and variable costs so one major thing that impacts resource companies is simply the current projected price of those resources this means that if the price of oil goes up or down it will partially affect the value of the two oil companies above but how much it affects each company will depend on the volume of oil it and the timeline that it expects to get that oil for example maybe oil and iron ltd. has no currently producing oil rigs but it has just made massive investments which expect to drill oil in 2 years and the market expects oil prices to return to a high value in 2 years   in that case a drop in oil would impact oil inc. severely but perhaps it would n't impact oil and iron ltd. as much in this case for the particular share price movement related to the price of oil the two companies would not be correlated iron and copper ltd. would be unaffected by the price of oil this is a simplification oil prices impact many areas of the economy and therefore there would be no correlation at all between this company 's shares it is also likely that competitors face similar markets if consumer spending goes down then perhaps the stock of most consumer product companies would go down as well there would be outliers because specific companies may still succeed in a falling market but in generally there would be a lot of correlation between two companies with the same market   in the case that you list sony vs samsung there would be some factors that correlate positively and some that correlate negatively a clean example would be blackberry stock vs apple stock because apple 's success had specifically negative ramifications for blackberry and yet other tech company competitors also succeeded in the same time period meaning they did not correlate negatively with apple

the crucial insight is that the alternative to early exercise of an american call is not necessarily to hold it to expiry but to sell it and selling it at its value is always better than exercising it   note that this holds only for options on assets that do n't pay dividends here 's the proof using put call parity we know that at expiry t we have using a call and a put both struck at k = k if this is not clear to you consider the case where s is less than equal to or greater than k at maturity and go through each of them if the stock s does n't pay any dividends and there is no cost of carry etc we can replicate both sides now at time 0 we just buy one call sell one put that gives us the left hand side buy the stock and borrow money so that at time t we have to repay k that gives us the right hand side that means that now we only need to borrow df k where df is the discount factor and is less than one assuming the good old world where interest rates are positive thus c(0 = df k.   rearranging gives c(0 = df k +   that 's the value of the call if we sell it or hold it however if we exercise we only get = k now we see that c(0 > because we subtract less < k and add

if you are like most people your timing is kind of awful   what i mean by most is all   psychologically we have strong tendencies to buy when the market is high and avoid buying when it is low   one of the easiest to implement strategies to avoid this is dollar cost averaging   in most cases you are far better off making small investments regularly having said that you may need to save a bit in order to make subsequent investments because of minimums    for me there is also a positive psychological effect of putting money to work sooner and more often   i find it enjoyable to purchase shares of a mutual fund or stock and the days that i do so are a bit better than the others    an added benefit to doing regular investing is to have them be automated   many wealthy people describe this as a key to success as they can focused on the business of earning money in their chosen profession as opposed to investing money they have already earned   additionally the author of i will teach you to be rich cites this as a easy free and key step in building wealth

this election only applies to payments that you make within 120 days of your having received loan money these would n't be required payments which is why they are called early payments for example let 's say that you 've just received $ 10,000 from your lender for a new loan one month later you pay $ 500 back this election decides how that $ 500 will be applied   the first choice apply as refund means that you are essentially returning some of the money that you initially borrowed it 's like you never borrowed it instead of a $ 10,000 loan it is now a $ 9,500 loan the accrued interest will be recalculated for the new loan amount   the second choice apply as payment means that your payment will first be applied to any interest that has accrued then applied to the principal while you are in school you do n't need to make payments on student loans however interest is accruing from the day you get the money this interest is simple interest which means that the interest is only based on the loan principal the interest is not compounding and you are not paying interest on interest after you leave school and your grace period expires you enter repayment and you have to start making payments at this point all the interest that has accrued from the time you first received the money until now is capitalized this means that the interest is added to your loan principal and interest will now be calculated on this new larger amount to avoid this you can pay the interest as you go before it is capitalized which will save you from having to pay even more interest later on   as to which method is better just as they told you right on the form the apply as refund method will save you the most money in the long run   however as i said at the beginning this election only applies if you make a payment within 120 days from receiving loan funds since you are already out of school and in repayment i do n't think it matters at all what you select here   for any students reading this and thinking about loans i want to issue a warning student loans can ruin people later in life if you truly feel that taking out a loan is the only way you 'll be able to get the education you need minimize these as much as possible borrow as little as possible pay as much as you can as early as you can and plan on knocking these out asap great lakes has a few pages that discuss these topics

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

during market hours there are a lot of dealers offering to buy and sell all exchange traded stocks dealers do n't actually care about the company 's fundamentals and they set their prices purely based on order flow if more people start to buy than sell the dealer notices his inventory going down and starts upping the price both his bid and ask there are also traders who may not be dealers but are willing to sell if the price goes high enough or buy if the price goes low enough this keeps the prices along smoothly during normal trading hours if you buy something and turn around and sell it two minutes later you 'll probably be losing a couple cents per share outside normal market hours the dealers who continue to have a bid and ask listed know that they do n't have access to good price information   there is n't a liquid market of continuous buying and selling for the dealer to set prices he considers safe so what does he do he widens the spread he does n't know what the market will open tomorrow at and does n't know if he 'll be able to react quickly to news so instead of bidding $ and offering at $ he 'll move that out to $ 33 and $ 36 the dealer still makes money sometimes off this because maybe some trader realized that he has options expiring tomorrow or a short position that he 's going to get a margin call on or some kind of event that pretty much forces him to trade or maybe he 's just panicking and to some news so why not trade after hours because there 's no liquidity and trading when there 's no liquidity costs you a lot

what if there is only one trading day and the volume is smaller than    the open interest on that one trading day this is assuming there is    no open interest before that day i pulled this from a comment this ca n't happen we have zero open interest on day one on day 2 i buy 10 contracts volume is 10 and now open interest is also 10 tomorrow if i do n't sell open interest starts at 10 and will rise by whatever new contracts are traded    this is an example i removed the stock name this happens to be the expiration the 10 contract traded on the $ 3 strike happen to be mine you can see how open interest is cumulative representing all outstanding contracts it 's obvious to me the shares traded as high as $ 5 at some point which created the interest i.e. the desire to trade this strike most activity tends to occur near the current price

i 'm afraid you have missed a few of the outcomes commonly faced by millions of americans so i would like to take a moment to discuss a wider range of outcomes that are common in the united states today most importantly some of these happen before retirement is ever reached and have grave consequences yet are often very closely linked to financial health and savings not planning ahead long term 10 20 + years is generally associated with not planning ahead even for the next few months so i 'll start there the most common thing that happens is the loss of a job or illness injury that put someone out of work 6 in 10 adults in the us have less than $ 500 in savings so desperation can set in very quickly as the very next paycheck will be short or missing many of these americans have no other source of saved money either so it 's not like they can draw on retirement savings as they do n't have that either even if they are able to get another job or recover enough to get back to work in a few weeks this can set off a desperate cycle those who have lost their jobs to technical obsolescence major economic downturns or large economic changes are often more severely affected people once making excellent middle class or above wages with full benefits find they can not find work that pays even vaguely similarly in the past this was especially common in heavy labor jobs like manufacturing meat packing and so on but more recently this has happened in financial sectors and real estate construction during the 2008 economic events the more resilient people had padding switched careers and found other options the less resilient did n't especially during the 1970s and 1980s many people affected by large losses of earning potential became sufficiently desperate that they fell heavily or lost their functioning status into substance abuse including alcohol and drugs cocaine and being especially popular in this segment of the population life disruption made even more major by a lack of savings is a key trigger to many people who are already at risk of issues like substance addiction mental health or any ongoing legal issues another common issue is something more simple like loss of transportation that threatens their ability to hold their job and a lack of alternatives available through support networks savings family and public transit if their credit is bad or their income is new they may find even companies turn them away or even worse the most companies welcome them in with high interest and hair trigger repossession policies the most common cycle of desperation i have seen usually starts with banking over drafts and its associated fees people who are afraid and desperate start to make increasingly desperate short sighted choices as tunnel vision sets in and they are unable to consider longer term strategy as they focus on holding on to what they have and survival many industries have found this set of people quite profitable including high interest check cashing payday loans and title loans aka legal loan sharks and it is not rare that desperate people are encouraged to get on increasing cycles of loan amounts and fees that worsen their financial situation in exchange for short term relief as fees penalties and interest add up they lose more and more of their already strained income to stay afloat banks that are otherwise reputable and fair may soon blacklist them and turn them away and suddenly only the least reputable and most predatory places offer to help at all usually with a big smile at first and almost always with awful strings attached drugs and alcohol are often readily available nearby and their use can easily turn from recreational to addictive given the allure of the it offers especially for those made vulnerable by increasing stress desperation loss of hope isolation and fear those who have not been within the system of poverty and desperation often do not see just how many people actively work to encourage bad decision making with big budgets charm charisma and talent the voices of reason trying to act as to call people to take care of themselves and their future are all too easily drowned out in the of a smooth and enticing operation   i personally think this is one of the greatest contributions of the movement to build personal financial health and awareness as so many great people find ever more effective ways of pointing out the myriad ways people try to bleed your money out of you with no real concern for your welfare looking out for your own well being and not being taking in by the wide array of cons and bad deals is all too often fighting against a strong societal current as i 'm sure most of our regular contributors are all too aware with increasing desperation often comes illegal maneuvers often quite petty in nature those with substance abuse issues often start reselling drugs to others to try to cover lost income or get ahead with often debilitating results on long term earning potential if they get caught which can include cost barriers to higher education even if they do turn their life around   i think most people are surprised by how little and petty things can quickly cycle out of control this can include things like not paying minor parking or traffic tickets which can snowball from the $ 10 70 range into thousands of dollars due to non payment often escalating and adding additional penalties triggering traffic stops for no other reason etc arrest and more the elderly are not exempt from this system and many of america 's elderly spend their latter years in prison while not all are tied to financial desperation as i 've outlined above a deeper look at poverty crime and the elderly will be deeply disturbing some of these people enter the system while young but some only later in life rather than homelessness being something that only happens after people hit retirement it often comes considerably earlier than that if this occurs the outcome is generally quite a bit more extreme than living off social security some just die the average life expectancy of adults who are living on the street is only about 64 years of age only 2 years into early retirement age and before full retirement age which could of course be increased in the next 10 20 years even if life expectancy and health of those without savings do n't improve most have extremely restricted access to healthcare often being emergency only and have no comforts of home to rest and recuperate when they become ill or injured there are many people dedicated to helping yet the help is far less than the problem generally and being able to take advantage of most of the help scheduling where to go for food who to talk to about other services etc heavily depends on the person not already suffering from conditions that limit their ability to care for themselves mental conditions mobility etc there is also a shockingly higher risk of physical assault injury and death depending on where the person goes but it is far higher in almost every case regardless one of the chief problems in considering only retirement savings is it assumes that you 'll only have need for the savings and good financial health once you reach approximately the age of 62 if it is not raised before you get there which it has been multiple times to date as noted above if homelessness occurs and becomes longstanding before that the result is generally shortened lifespan and premature death the other major issue of health is that preventative care from simple dentistry to basic self care adequate sleep and rest a safe place to is often sacrificed in the scrambling to survive and limited budget those who develop chronic conditions which need regular care are more severely affected and injury related limb loss as one example are far more likely for those without regular support resources homeless destitute or otherwise other posters have done a great job in pointing out a number of the lesser known governmental programs so i wo n't list them again i only note the important that this may be quite a bit less in total than you think social security on average pays retired workers $ 1300 a month it was designed to avoid an all too common occurrence of simple starvation rampant homelessness and abject poverty among a large number of elderly no guarantee is made that you wo n't have to leave your home move away from your friends and family if you live in an expensive part of the country etc some people get a bit more some people get quite a bit less and the loss of family and friend networks especially to such at risk groups can be incredibly damaging note also that those financially desperate will be generally pushed to take retirement at the minimum age even though benefits would be larger and more livable if they delayed their retirement this is an additional cost of not having other sources of savings which is not considered by many well yes many can not retire whether they want to or not   i can not find statistics on this specifically but many are indeed just unable to financially retire without considerable loss social security and other government plans help avoid the most desperate scenarios but so many aspects of aging is not covered by insurance or affordable on the limited income that aging can be a cruel and lonely process for those with no other financial means those with no savings are not likely to be able to afford to regularly visit children and grandchildren give gifts on holidays go on cruises enjoy the best care or afford new technological devices to assist their aging especially those too new and experimental to be covered by the insurance plans they have   what 's worse but most people do not plan for either is that diminished mental and physical capacity can render many people unable to navigate the system successfully as we 've seen here many questions are from adult children trying to help their elderly parents in retirement and include aging parents who do not understand their own access to social security medicaid medicare resources or community help organizations   what happens to those aging without children or younger friend networks to step in and help well we do n't really have a replacement for that i am not aware of any research that just how many in the us do n't take advantage of the resources they are fully qualified to make use of and enjoy due to a lack of education social issues feeling embarrassed and afraid or inability to organize and communicate effectively a resource being available is not very much help for those who do n't have enough supportive resources to make use of it which is very hard to effectively plan for yet is exceedingly common without one 's own independent resources the natural aging and end of life process can be especially harsh elderly who are economically and food insecure experience far heightened incidence of depression asthma heart attack and heart failure and a host of other they are at greater risk for abuse accidental death life quality threatening conditions developing or worsening and more scare tactics are n't always persuasive and they do little to improve the lives of many because the people who need to know it most generally just do n't believe it but my hope here is that the rather highly educated and sophisticated audience here will see a little more of the harsher world that their own good decisions good fortune culture and position in society shields them from experiencing there is a downside to good outcomes which is that it can cause us to be blind to just how extremely different is the experience of others not all experience such terrible outcomes but many hundreds of thousands in the us alone do and sometimes worse it is not helpful to be unrealistic about this life is not inherently kind however none of this suggests that being co dependent or giving up your own financial well being is necessary or advised to help others share your budgeting strategies your plans for the future your gentle concerns and give of your time and resources as generously as you can within your own set budgets and ensuring your own financial well being and most of all do not so easily give up on your family and friends and count them as life long hopeless do wells let 's all strive to be good kind honest and offer non judgmental support and advice to the best of our ability to the people we care about it is ultimately their choice restricted by their own experiences and abilities but need not be fate people regularly but sometimes they surprise and delight take care of yourself and give others the best chance you can too

first of all it 's quite common place in gnucash and in accounting in general i believe to have accounts that represent concepts or ideas rather than actual accounts at some institution   for example my personal gnucash book has a plethora of expense accounts just made up by me to categorize my spending but all of the transactions are really just entries in my checking account as to your actual question i 'd probably do this by tracking such savings as negative expenses using an expense account and entering negative numbers   you could track grocery savings in your grocery expense account or if you want to easily analyze the savings data for example seeing savings over a certain time period you would probably want a separate grocery savings expense account edit regarding putting that money aside here 's an idea   let 's say you bought a $ 20 item that was on sale for $ 15   you could have a single transaction in gnucash that includes four splits one for each of the following actions decrease your checking account by $ 20 increase your expense account by $ 20 decrease your discount savings expense account by $ 5 and increase your savings account where you 're putting that money aside by $ 5

this seems to be a very emotional thing for people and there are a lot of conflicting answers   i agree with joetaxpayer in general but i think it 's worth coming at it from a slightly different angle you are in canada and you do n't get to deduct anything for your mortgage interest like in the us so that simplifies things a bit   the next thing to consider is that in an amortized mortgage the later payments include increasingly more principal   this matters because the extra payments you make earlier in the loan have much more impact on reducing your interest than those made at the end of the loan why does that matter   let 's say for example your loan was for $ 100 k and you will end up getting $ 150 k for the sale after all the transaction costs   consider two scenarios if you do the math you 'll see that the total is the same in both scenarios   nominally $ 50 k of equity is worth the same as $ 50 k in the bank but wait you protest what about the interest on the loan   for sure you likely wo n't get on money in a bank account in this environment   but there 's a big difference between money in the bank and equity in your house you ca n't withdraw part of your equity   you either have to sell the house which takes time or you have to take out a loan against your equity which is likely going to be more expensive than your current loan this is the basic reasoning behind the advice to have a certain period of time covered   4 months is n't terrible but you could have more of a cushion   consider things like upcoming maintenance or improvements on the house   are you going to need a new roof before you move   new driveway or landscape improvements   having enough cash to make a down payment on your next home can be a huge advantage because you can make a non contingent offer which will often be accepted at a lower value than a contingent offer by putting this money into your home equity you essentially make it inaccessible and there 's an opportunity cost to that   you will also earn exact 0 on that equity   the only benefit you get is to reduce a loan which is charging you a tiny rate that you are unlikely to get again any time soon i would take that extra cash and build more cushion   i would also put as much money into any tax sheltered investments as you can   you should expect to earn more than on your long term investments   you really are n't in debt as far as the house goes as long as you are not underwater on the loan the net value of that asset is positive on your balance sheet   yes you need to keep making payments but a big account balance covers that   in fact if you hit on hard times and you 've put all your extra cash into equity you might ironically not being able to make your payments and lose the home one thing i just realized is that since you are in canada you probably do n't have a fixed rate on your mortgage   a variable rate loan does make the calculation different   if you are concerned that rates may spike significantly i think you still want to increase your cushion but whether you want to increase long term investments depends on your risk tolerance

to answer the first part of your question yes i 've done that   i did even a bit more   i once had a job that i was n't sure i 'd keep and the economy was n't great either   in case my next employer would n't let me contribute to a 401(k from day one and because i did n't want to my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill i front loaded my 401(k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year   the contribution limits were lower than $ back then as for the reduced cash flow you need of course a buffer account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or front loading 401(k contributions   you should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck   as for the reduced cash flow i think large scale contributions can crowd out other long term saving   priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the trade off between them is a real concern   if they 're out basic and discretionary consumer expenses that 's a totally different kind of problem which you do n't seem to have which is great so about the trade off between large scale 401(k contributions and saving for the down payment   i 'd say maxing out 401(k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends   if after several years of maxing out your 401(k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority you 'll see money flow to the money market account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate thanks to that savings culture as for the increasing future earnings no   most people i 've known for a long time if they saved 20 when they made $ 20k year they continued to save 20 or more when they later made $ 100k year   people who spent the entire paycheck while making $ 50k year always say if only i got a raise to $ 60k year i 'd save a few thousand   but they eventually graduate to $ 100k year and still spend the entire paycheck   it 's all about your savings culture on the second part of your question yes roth is a great tool especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the long term budget deficits   so contributing to 401(k to maximize the match then max out roth as others suggested is a great advice   after you 've done that see what else you can do more 401(k saving for the house etc

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

there is a measure of protection for investors it is not the level of protection provided by fdic or ncua but it does exist securities investor protection corporation what sipc protects sipc protects against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks    and bonds held by a customer at a financially troubled sipc member    brokerage firm the limit of sipc protection is $ 500,000 which    includes a $ 250,000 limit for cash most customers of failed brokerage    firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected    there is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of    the united states a non u.s. citizen with an account at a brokerage    firm that is a member of sipc is treated the same as a resident or    citizen of the united states with an account at a brokerage firm that    is a member of sipc sipc protection is limited sipc only protects the custody function of    the broker dealer which means that sipc works to restore to customers    their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the    brokerage firm liquidation begins sipc does not protect against the decline in value of your securities    sipc does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and    other securities sipc does not protect claims against a broker for    bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments it is important to recognize that sipc protection is not the same as    protection for your cash at a federal deposit insurance corporation    fdic insured banking institution because sipc does not protect the    value of any security investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market    value sipc was not created to protect these risks that is why sipc    does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and    other investment falls for any reason instead in a liquidation sipc    replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible    to do so

well i 'm not going to advise whether it 's a good idea to invest in this company though often otc is pretty scary but it does have a product an ad blocker it did post financials and it 's trading on the otc qb which is better than the pink sheets so you need to look these over and study up on the product to decide if it is overpriced or not   what might have occurred the patriot farm becoming is that the latter bought up the stock of the former this is i believe called using a shell which is not necessarily a bad thing and is using this as a way to be registered i.e. sell to non accredited investors via the otc market   so i 'm really just answering your third question   yes you have to do a lot of due diligence to see if buying this stock is a good deal or not   it might be the next big thing   or it might not it certainly is the case that low trading volume allows a relatively small trade to really change the stock price so the penny stocks do tend to be easier to inflate side comment   the bid ask spreads are pretty big with a best bid of 0.35 and best ask of

i think you wrong about this there are two problems i see with your example   when you created something which costs $ 150 you have increased the amount of money in the world from $ 200 to $ 450 because money is the storage of value   after the first transaction you have said that you have $ 250 which presumably means the money in the bank however at a later point when you go to the bank demanding $ 500 you only consider physical notes to be money the bank at this point could give you a check book and if you wanted to spend it would simple credit the other person $ 500 and remove that amount from your account in addition the bank could always repossess the items you have sold to the other person and give them to you in lieu of physical money

it 's my understand that leasing is never the better overall deal with the possible exception of a person who would otherwise buy a brand new car every 2 or 3 years and does not drive a lot of miles note in the case of a company car canadian taxes let you deduct the entire lease payment which clearly has some principal in it if you lease while if you buy you can only deduct the interest and must depreciate the car according to their schedule this can make leasing more attractive to those buying a car through a corporation i do n't know if this applies in the us the numbers you ran through in class presumably involved calculating the interest paid over the term of the loan can you not just redo the calculation using actual interest and lease numbers from a randomly chosen current car ad i suspect if you do you will discover leasing is still not the right choice

a certified financial planner has passed a licensing exam and will advise you and help you reach your financial goals a good cfp can help you a lot especially if you are unsure how to set up your insurance investment savings and financial plans on your own you do not need a cfp to get a life insurance policy if you do get a cfp he or she should help you above and beyond life insurance i.e. retirement planning investment advice education planning etc it 's advantageous to you to pay a fixed price for services instead of a percentage or commission negotiate fees up front for life insurance in most cases a term policy will fit your needs whole life universal life etc combine investments and life insurance into a single product and are big commission makers for the salesman they make it sound like the best thing ever so be aware one of my rules of thumb is that generally speaking the larger the commission is for the salesperson the worse the product is for the consumer welcome to life insurance pitches term life is far less expensive and provides a death benefit and nothing else if you just had a baby and need to protect your family for example term life is often a good solution easy to buy and inexpensive as you stated any of the major providers will do just fine

a lot of people on here will likely disagree with me and this opinion    in my opinion the answer lies in your own motives and intentions    if you 'd like to be more cognizant of the market i 'd just dive in and buy a few companies you like   many people will say you should n't pick your own stocks you should buy an index fund or this etf or this much bonds etc   you already have retirement savings capital allocation is important there   you 're talking about an account total around 10 of your annual salary and assuming you have sufficient liquid emergency funds there 's a lot of non monetary benefit to being more aware of the economy and the stock market   but if you find the house you 're going to buy you may have to liquidate this account at a time that 's not ideal possibly at a loss if all you 're after is a greater return on your savings than the paltry 0.05 or whatever the big deposit banks are paying then a high yield savings account is the way i 'd go or a cd ladder yes the market generally goes up but it does n't always go up   get your money somewhere that it 's and you can be certain how much you 'll have tomorrow assuming a gain the gain you 'll see will pale in comparison to the deposits you 'll make   deposits grow accounts   consider these scenarios if you allocate $ 1,000 per month to this account    1 assuming an investment return of 5 you 're talking about $ 330 return in the first year not counting commissions or possible losses 2 assuming a high yield savings account at 1.25 you 're talking about $ 80 in the first year    also remember both of these amounts would be taxable i 'll admit in the event of 5 return you 'll have about four times the gain but you 're talking about a difference of on $ 12,000   over three to five years the most significant contributor to the account by far will be your deposits    anyway as i 'm sure you know this is not investment advice and you may lose money etc

consumer reports offers a service that can tell you detailed actual cost to a dealer for a specific model and accessories real cost after rebates not just invoice price it costs a bit to order these reports but if you are serious about buying a new car they are a highly recommended tool cu is independent and will give you the best info available and simply walking into the dealership with the report in your hand can save huge amounts of negotiating if you can give it to me for $ 500 over the real price as shown here i 'll sign now of course standard advice is that it 's usually better to buy a recent model used car i believe cu has other reports that can help you determine what a fair price is in that case but usually i just bring it to a trusted garage and pay them to tell me exactly how much work it needs and whether they think it 's worth the asking price

this is what happens when you privatize the costs of maternity leave the law is that maternity leave exists and it covers all employment why then is it not paid by the state with taxes on the employer but instead paid by the employer on a case by case basis   this means that it 's possible for one employer to have more expenses on maternity leave than another employer thus incentivizing not hiring potential mothers   edit we know how much maternity leave costs businesses each year so just add that extra sum to the taxes paid by employers and release them from having to pay people on maternity leave

you should never close a credit card account unless it has an annual fee or you are overspending on it open lines of credit even un utilized ones have a positive effect on your credit score first of all they increase your total credit which helps your score second of all they are always paid on time which is another benefit finally they increase the length of your credit history you can keep unused credit cards forever in your drawer they are rarely closed due to inactivity and cost you nothing however if your card has an annual fee you should close it the potential loss to your credit score is unlikely to offset the annual fee

you are correct   credit card companies charge the merchant for every transaction   but the merchant is n't necessarily going to give you discount for paying in cash   the idea is that by providing more payment options they increase sales covering the cost of the transaction fee   that said some merchants require a minimum purchase for using a credit card though this may be against the policies of some issuers in the u.s. i have no idea about india also correct   they hope that you 'll carry a balance so that they can charge you interest on it   some credit cards are setup to charge as many fees as they possibly can   these are typically those low limit cards that are marketed as good ways to build up your credit   most are basically scams in the fact that the fees are outrageous update regarding minimum purchases apparently visa is allowing minimum purchase requirements in the u.s. of $ 10 or less   however it seems that mastercard still does not allow them for the most part   moral of the story research the credit card issuers policies   a further update regarding minimum purchases in the us merchants will be allowed to require a minimum purchase of up to $ 10 for credit card transactions   i am guessing that prompted the visa rule change mentioned above more detail can be found here in this answer along with a link to the text of the bill itself

i think the top three answers by joe anthony and are giving you all the detail that you need on a technical sense although i would like to add a simple picture that that you can not really compare day trading to long term trading and that the addictive and aspect that you mentioned can not be taken out of consideration the long term investor is like someone buying a house for investment you carefully look at all offers on the market you choose by many factors price location quality environment neighborhood and extras after a long research you pick your favorites and give them a closer look until you finally choose the object of desire which will pay off in 10 years and will be a wise investment in your future now this sounds like a careful but smart person who knows what he wants and has enough patience to have his earnings in the future the short term investor is like someone running into the casino for a game of black jack roulette or poker he is a person that thinks he has found the one and only formula the philosopher 's stone the money press and is seeking immense profits in just one night and if it does not work he is sure that this was just bad coincidence and that his formula is correct and will work the next night this person is a pure gambler and running the risk of becoming addicted he is seeking quick and massive profits and does not give up even though he knows that the chances of becoming a millionaire in a casino are quite unrealistic and not better than playing in a lottery so if you are a gamer and the profit is less important than the fun then short term is the thing for you if you are not necessarily seeking tons of millions but just want to keep your risk of loss to a minimum then long term is your way to go so it is a question of personality expectations and priorities the answer why losses are bigger on high frequency signals is answered elsewhere but i am convinced in reality it is a question of what you want and therefore very subjective i have worked for both i have worked for a portfolio company that has gone through periods of ups and downs but on the long term has made a very tempting profit which made me regret that i did not ask for shares instead of money as payment these people are very calm and intelligent people they spend all their time investigating and searching for interesting objects for their portfolio and replace losers with winners they are working for your money and investors just relax and wait this has a very serious taste to it and i for my part would always prefer this form of investment i have worked for an investment broker selling futures i programmed the account management for their customers and in all those years i have only seen one customer that made the million but tons of customers that had made huge losses and this company was very emotional harsh employees changing day by day top sellers coming in all the people working there where gamblers just like their customers well it ended one day when the police came and confiscated all computers from them because customers have complained about their huge losses i am glad that i worked as a remote developer for them and got paid in money and not in options so both worlds are so different from each other the chances for bigger profits are higher on day trading but so are the chances for bigger losses so it is pure gambling if you like gambling split your investment half in long term and other half in short term that is fun and wise in one but one thing is for sure in over ten years i have seen many customers loosing loads of money in options in the future markets or currencies but i have never seen anyone making a loss in long term portfolio investment there have been hard years where the value dropped almost 30 but that was caught up by the following years so that the only risk was minimizing the profit

in some cases perhaps but in others not   several homes near me were sold over and over again during the bubble years at incrementally higher and higher sale prices the last owners in nearly all cases defaulted and the banks after dragging their feet for a couple of years finally foreclosed and sold the homes off cheap   in all but one of the distressed sale cases the people buying the houses now are in fact moving into them as their primary home the exception being a current resident who bought the adjacent home with the intentions of fixing it up amp renting it out i believe at least initially to a family member but in all cases in no small part due to the fact that they were able to purchase the properties cheap these new owners are investing substantial money into fixing them up new roof amp gutters new windows amp doors paint and/or siding often all new some landscaping etc   also from the perspective of our homeowners association all of these new people think our annual hoa fees are a bargain whereas the previous bubble era homeowners if having invested almost nothing they could truly be called that did nothing but whine and complain well and once they began defaulting on their mortgages they also defaulted on their hoa fees   so it 's a win win for our neighborhood we 're getting good solid residents who are planning on taking care of their properties the exact opposite of what you are claiming    the house flippers you decry were the ones buying with no money down during the bubble era and they nearly killed the neighborhood

no it 's perhaps a bit obvious but with the shorter term loan you would be contractually obligated to pay the higher monthly payment by paying double on the longer loan you retain the flexibility to pay less and you would pay less interest if you truly doubled your payment on the longer loan this is because you 'd be paying off more of the principal more quickly but you 'd also be making a slightly higher payment than on the shorter term loan you can play with the amortization calculator at bankrate to understand this

wells fargo uses a service called clearxchange update it is now called zelle to do this transfer without an account number this is the same service bank of america uses so when you configured your account to be linked to clearxchange wells fargo customers can use it the same way bank of america customers can   this also applies to chase bank since your bank is a member they 've integrated the service into your online bill pay if your bank is a clearxchange member you will need to use your current online or mobile banking service to send and receive payments if you had n't previously configured it through bofa you 'd have been taken to their site to register an account in order to receive the money it seems they explicitly point out here that they will automatically deposit any money you receive through their service without your having to accept the payment like you would from other p2p pay services   if you do n't want to use this service anymore i suggest contacting your bank but if they ca n't or wo n't help you you can contact clearxchange customer service to have your account closed

how to use your shares if you own common shares in a company as opposed to a fund then you have the right but not the obligation to one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders usually this occurs once a year usually these questions regard approval of auditors sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board you will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in   preferred shares usually are not voting shares but common shares always are   by the way i do not recommend owning shares in companies i recommend funds instead either etfs or mutual funds owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company owning funds spreads that risk around thus reducing your exposure   there are really two purposes for owning shares 1 owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future hopefully at a profit   one obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options but options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point   you may find it useful to sign up for a free daily email from

it depends   very generally when yields go up stocks go down and when yields go down stocks go up as has been happening lately if we look at the yield of the 10 year bond it reflects future expectations for interest rates   if the rate today is very low but expectations are that the short term rates will go up that would be reflected in a higher yield simply because no one would buy the longer term bond if they could simply wait out and get a better return on term investments   if expectations are that the rate is going down you get what 's called an inverted yield curve   the inverted yield curve is usually a sign of economic trouble ahead   yields are also influenced by inflation expectations as is alluding in his answer so   if the stock market crashes because the economy is doing poorly and if interest rates are relatively high then people would expect the rates to go down and therefore bonds will go up however if there 's rampant inflation and the rates are going up we can expect stocks and bonds to move in opposite directions   another interpretation of that is that one would expect stock prices to track inflation pretty well because company revenue is going to go up with inflation   if we 're just talking about a bump in the road correction in a healthy economy i would n't expect that to have much of an immediate effect though bonds might go down a little bit in the short term but possibly even more in the long term as interest rates eventually head higher   another scenario is a very low interest rate environment as today with a stock market crash and not a lot of room for yields to go further down both stocks and bonds are influenced by current interest rates interest rate expectations current inflation inflation expectations and stock price expectation   add noise and stir

a rather good irs paper on the topic states that a donation of a business in kind inventory would be   under irc however the fair market value must be    reduced by the amount of gain that would not be long term capital gain if the    property had been sold by the donor at the property 's fair market value determined    at the time of the contribution under this rule deductions for donated inventory    are limited to the property 's basis generally its cost where the fair market value    exceeds the basis   there are references to irc regulations in a narrative context you may find helpful this paper goes on for 16 pages describing detailed exceptions and the political reasons for the exceptions most of which are concerned with encouraging the donation of prepared food from restaurants to hunger charities by guaranteeing a value for something that would otherwise be trashed valueless and a worked out example of that had a cost of goods of $ 200 and a market value of $ 1000

there are several reasons to pay for data instead of using yahoo finance although these reasons do n't necessarily apply to you if you 're only planning to use the data for personal use   yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period you can opt to use the yahoo query language which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the csv files although the rate limit is higher for you may still run into it an api that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds   although the reliability varies throughout the site yahoo finance is n't considered the most reliable of sources you ca n't beat free of course but at least for research purposes the center for research in security prices crsp at and wharton is considered the gold standard on the commercial side data providers like bloomberg reuters also enjoy widespread popularity although both the output from and yahoo 's current csv output are fairly standard they wo n't necessarily remain that way a commercial api is basically a contract with the data provider that they wo n't change the format without significant prior notice but it 's reasonable to assume that if yahoo wanted to they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications a change in yahoo 's format would likely break many sites or applications too but their terms of use do state that yahoo may change suspend or any aspect of the yahoo finance modules at any time including the availability of any yahoo finance modules yahoo may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the yahoo finance modules or the yahoo web site without notice or liability if you 're designing a commercial application a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their api   according to yahoo finance 's license terms you ca n't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their badges whatever those are see here in this post a yahoo employee states the finance tos is fairly specific redistribution of data is only    allowed if you are using the badges the team has created otherwise you can use or whatever method to obtain data for    personal use the license itself states that you may not sell lease or the yahoo finance modules or access    or derive income from the use or provision of the yahoo    finance modules whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or    otherwise without yahoo 's prior express written permission in short for personal use yahoo finance is more than adequate for research or commercial purposes a data provider is a better option furthermore many commercial applications require more data than yahoo provides e.g. tick by tick data for equities derivatives futures data on mergers etc which a paid data source will likely provide yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements i ca n't find any examples at the moment but i had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10 k 's that he had come across i 've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered although i would assume edgar has some method for automatic retrieval if you want data that are guaranteed to be accurate or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it is n't you 'll need to pay for it

in some states it is your responsibility to pay the sales tax on a transaction even if the party your purchase from does n't collect it this is common with online purchases across state lines for example here in massachusetts if i buy something from new hampshire where there is no sales tax i am required to pay ma sales tax on the purchase when i file my income taxes buying a service that did not include taxes just shifts the burden of paperwork from the other party to me even if you would end up saving money by paying in cash as other here have pointed out you are sacrificing a degree of protection if something goes wrong with the transaction he could take your money and walk away without doing the work or do a sloppy job or even damage your vehicle without a receipt it is your word against his that the transaction ever even took place should you be worried that he is offering a discount for an under the table transaction probably not as long as you do n't take him up on it

i do n't think you 're missing anything on the math side as far as the payments   likewise it may seem everyone 's driving a nicer car but i 'm going to predict that 's based on area and a few other factors for instance my used car feels like riches in a college town   the behavior of why people would pay money especially with high interest debt for something is a little different to explain the behavior behind people who purchase luxury cars for some people a car is a purchase that they value similar to a person valuing the clothes they wear the house they live in or the equipment they buy and either borrowing or paying full price on an expensive car is worth it to them   we can call it a status symbol and criticize the financial waste without realizing wait this is something they value like a rare book collector likes rare books would a rare book collector pass on borrowing money if it meant a once in a lifetime rare book purchase opportunity have you ever felt wow this is cool awesome amazing with something   basically that 's how many of them feel toward these cars   as much as i 'd love to say they 're only doing it for status because i 'm not a car person that 's actually somewhat de and the more i 've met people like this the more i 've realized this is their thing and to them it 's totally worth it even with all the debt   i have no doubt that there 's a percentage of them who truly may be misled maybe they do n't realize the full cost of borrowing money or leasing   still for those who do n't care the full cost that 's because it 's their thing   we can all agree that it 's still not wise to do financially borrow on a luxury vehicle and it wo n't change that some people will do it

you are weighting a certain cost of the mortgage interest versus the possible gain of the value of the house    take the interest you pay per month and divide it by the current value of the house   say your interest is 3 of the value of the house may be more or less depending on the balance owed and the interest rate of your mortgage say the average appreciation in your area is also 3 but that means that there 's only a 50 chance that the actual appreciation will be more than that assuming the odds are equal either way and there 's a 50 change that you 'll be worse off    generally trading a risk free loss for a risky gain of equal size is not a good investment you generally can find better average returns on risky investments so your best bet is to sell now and pay of the mortgage

here 's another way that i look at it   say you and me were 50 50 partners in a small business suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money someone let 's call him warren has the money we need hence in return for the money we offer warren an equal stake in the business   i.e. all three of us own 33 stake now for both you and me our stake reduced from   50 that it was before warren 's entry to only 33 now   while that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us we both agreed to give warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand   ergo what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie itself and hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances   two small points a this does n't   in any way show the dilution must make sense only that it can sometimes make sense b of course in the case of a large corporation they do not need your personal approval for the dilution but hey neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product

i would say yes it 's worth building additional retirement savings on top of a defined benefit pension plan plans that pay set annual income   here are a couple of reasons do n't put all your eggs in one basket   while is probably in good shape things can and do happen to pension plans   while there is a provincial system in place to guarantee some of your pension income $ 1000/mo if your plan goes bust your benefits are not 100 guaranteed defined benefit pension plans are designed to provide recurring annual income like your paycheck when you are employed   you ca n't take more out from your defined benefit pension plan when an emergency comes up   whereas your rrsp and eventually in retirement are accounts from which you can take out extra in any given year if necessary that being said canada revenue agency cra wo n't let you save as much in your rrsp as other people who do n't have pension plans normally individuals in canada are entitled to save 18 of their earned income up to a limit $ in 2009 in an rrsp each year   however to level the playing field individuals who are in a pension plan get a pension adjustment pa number on their t4 which reduces their available rrsp contribution room   otherwise they 'd be able to tax shelter more income for retirement than others so i would suggest if you have the rrsp room consider using it   i 'd also suggest you look at a tax free savings account tfsa especially if you do n't have much rrsp room due to the pension adjustment   if you 're not sure whether to use an rrsp or a tfsa consider both

yes there is such possibility also there 's a possibility people made your computer your operation system your browser etc put there some code there that would intercept your communications and steal your money so could bank clerks and unlike all other examples this really happened in real world numerous times though usually at smaller banks atm makers etc   in the modern world you rely on things made by thousands of people this is a part of modern world 's conveniences you do n't have to use it you can store all your money in a big jar in your basement and nobody but occasional thief breaking in could take it   however fraudulent unauthorized transactions in most banks can be rolled back and any transaction is reported to you so fraud from mint.com people would be quite low on my list of risks much bigger risk is that somebody could break into mint.com servers and steal information about your accounts from there or install some malicious code i believe they have good protections but no security system is perfect you need to evaluate how the convenience of using mint.com compares to your personal feeling about this risk if you feel you could n't sleep at night knowing somewhere out there there is information about your money do n't use it i do n't worry about it too much as i know the chance of it happening is low and the chance of getting the money back if it happens is high but if you feel differently do n't do it

what you 're referring to is the yield   the issue with these sorts of calculations is that the dividend is n't guaranteed until it 's declared   it may have paid the quarterly dividend like clockwork for the last decade that does not guarantee it will pay this quarter    regarding question number 2   yield is generally an after the fact calculation   dividends are paid out of current or retained earnings   if the company becomes hot and the stock price doubles but earnings are relatively similar the dividend will not be doubled to maintain the prior yield the yield will instead be halved because the dividend per share was made more expensive to attain due to the increased share price    as for the calculation obviously your yield will likely vary from the yield published on services like google and yahoo finance   the variation is strictly based on the price you paid for the share   dividend per share is a declared amount   assuming a $ 10 share paying a quarterly dividend of $ 0.25 your yield is now figure that you paid $ 8.75 for the share now the way dividends are allocated to shareholders depends on dates published when the dividend is declared   the day you purchase the share the day your transaction clears etc are all vital to being paid a particular dividend   here 's a link to the sec with related information i suppose it goes without saying but historical dividend payments should not be your sole evaluation criteria   personally i would be extremely wary of a company paying a 40 dividend $ 1 quarterly dividend on a $ 10 stock it 's very possible that in your example bar corp is a more sound investment additionally this has really nothing to do with p e price earnings ratios

let 's take a step back my fictional company a is a solid old established company it 's in consumer staples so people buy the products in good times and bad it has a dividend of $ only knowing this you have to decide how much you would be willing to pay for one share   you might decide that $ 20 is fair why because that 's a 5 return on your money 1/20 = 5 and given the current rates you 're happy for a 5 dividend but this company does n't give out all its earnings as a dividend it really earns $ 1.50 so the p e you are willing to pay is or   many companies offer no dividend but of course they still might have earnings and the p e is one metric that used to judge whether one wishes to buy a stock   a high p e implies the buyers think the stock will have future growth and they are to pay more today to hold it a low p e might be a sign the company is solid but not growing if such a thing is possible

you have some of the math right but are missing a few things here 's what i can offer if i leave anything out someone please expand or clarify rental income can be reduced by mortgage interest and maintenance costs as you mentioned but also by property tax payments association fees insurance costs landlord expenses and depreciation note that if you do n't live in the property for 3 years you 'll have to pay capital gains tax if when you sell the house you can live in it again for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid this many people recommend only assuming you will get 10 months of rental income a year to account for transitions between tenants difficult in finding new tenants and the occasional deadbeat tenant this also adds a buffer for unexpected problems you need to fix in the house if you ca n't at least break even on 10 months of income a year consider the risk i think there are also some cases where you need to repay depreciation amounts that you have deducted but i do n't know the details renting out a house can be fun and profitable but it 's very far from a sure thing i 'd always recommend preparation and caution and of course talking to professionals about the finances accounting and lease writing good luck

if you get for state tax refund you need to declare it as income only if you took deduction on state taxes in the prior year i.e. if you took standard deductions you do n't need to declare the refund as income if you did itemize you have to declare the refund as income and deduct the taxes paid last year on your schedule a. if this year you 're not itemizing you lost the tax benefit if it was not clear from my answer the taxes paid and the refund received are unrelated the fact that you paid tax and received refund in the same year does n't make them in any way related even if both refer to the same taxable year

when the strike price $ 25 in this case is in the money even by $ 0.01 your shares will be sold the day after expiration if you take no action if you want to let your shares go allow assignment rather than close the short position and sell the long position it will be cheaper that way if you want to keep your shares you must buy back the option prior to 4pm est on expiration friday first ask yourself why you want to keep the shares is it to write another option is it to hold for a longer term strategy assuming this is a covered call writing account you should consider rolling the option this involves buying back the near term option and selling the later date option of a similar or higher strike make sure to check to see if there is an upcoming earnings report in the latter month because you may want to avoid writing a call in that situation i never write a call when there 's an upcoming er prior to expiration good luck alan

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt

yes but the rates at which they 're borrowing make all the difference   japan 's central bank is borrowing at about 2 percent on a 30 year bond and greece is borrowing at 18 percent japan would thus be paying 4.6 of gdp on debt service for government borrowing while greece would thus be paying 27 assuming that all current bonds could be converted to current rates    markets rates bonds government bonds stats money long html    further as many other commenters have noted japan retains the ability to print money and thus inflate their debt away while greece relies on the european central bank which would not the entire eurozone to help out greece 's government   as a comparison the us is currently paying 1.3 of its gdp on government debt service    my calculations are amateur please correct me if i 'm wrong   as dean baker blogs blog the interest burden of the debt   it is important to remember that most of the people in washington debates on economic policy do not know much economics they tend not to be very good at arithmetic either that is why they were blindsided by the collapse of the $ 8 trillion housing bubble that wrecked the economy   as we get endless about the crushing debt burden it is worth touching base with reality on occasion in that spirit brings you the latest data and projections on the ratio of the federal government 's interest payments to gdp courtesy of the congressional budget office cbo   interest to gdp ratio is currently at a crushing 1.3 percent near the post world war ii low however this figure the burden somewhat last year the federal reserve board refunded almost $ 80 billion to the treasury this was interest earned on government bonds and other assets it now holds that leaves a net interest burden of 0.8 percent of gdp by far the lowest of the post world war ii era   tl;dr what matters is not total size of debt alone but also borrowing costs and ability to inflate the debt away japan is paying very little on its large debt greece is paying a lot    tl;dr tl;dr i 'd like to borrow a few trillion dollars at 2 too

as more actively managed funds are driven out of the market the pricing of individual stocks should become less rational i.e. more stocks will become underpriced relative to their peers as stock prices become less rational the reward for active investing will increase since it will become easier to pick a winner eventually the market will reach a new equilibrium where only active investors who are good enough to turn a profit will remain even then passive investment will still do roughly as well as the market since it has low overhead and minimal investment lag there is no reason to expect the system to collapse since it is characterized primarily by negative feedback loops rather than positive feedback   the last few decades have seen a shift from active to passive investment because increased market transparency and efficiency have reduced the labor required to keep pricing rational basically as people have gotten better at predicting stock performance less active investment has been required to keep prices rational

problem with deciding investments in a company is that you have multiple potential options each with their projected returns but each also has some hard to estimate risks a further problem is that these opportunities arrive one by one so you usually can not compare project a vs. project b to decide which one is better the internal rate of return is a rule of thumb like way to make these decisions the company board may set an irr target of e.g. 15 and each executive will compare their projects against that target they 'll execute only the projects that are projected to give a good return but some of these projects will end up failing thus the real average profit will not be equal to irr important thing is that this target number gives ways to compare projects and also for the board to control the investments if the company has a good track record of being successful at projects the board might set an irr target of 10 and expect to get e.g. 8 return on their investment however if the company has a much larger risk of projects failing they might demand a predicted irr of 20 to account for the risk ultimately if the irr target is set too high the company will find no projects it considers profitable to invest in in practice if this happens the company owners are better off taking out the cash as dividends and investing it elsewhere

yes it 's a risk to put it in perspective if we look at the data for s&p returns since 1871 we get a cagr of but that comes with a standard deviation of this results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4   now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods the cagr drops to but the drops to this results in just 31 of the periods returning less than 4 on the flip side 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15 cagr   from the anti ds article you linked i see that you like a good analogy for me the returns of the s&p over the long term are like going to vegas and finding that after you run the math of their craps dice rolling game you find the expected return is 10 you can still lose on a given roll but over a series of a larger number of rolls you 're far ahead   to d stanley i agree that returns are not quite normal but they are not so far off of the rolling returns we 'd expect about 68 or 95 results to be 1 away we get 88 returns + 2 we 'd expect only 5 to lie outside this range and in fact i only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side 5 results vs the 7 total we 'd expect the results are a bit better more profitable than the normal bell curve fit would suggest

there is a service transferwise through which you can send money from uk banks to eur bank accounts in the eu for a 1 gbp fee much cheaper then about 25 gbp for a swift transfer you send them a uk national gbp transfer to their uk hsbc account and they send the equivalent amount in eur from their irish eur bank account to your eur account for example in germany what is best is that they use bare mid market forex exchange rates without any markup on the gbp to eur exchange rate which is usually in the range of 2 to 5 in banks so you do n't lose anything on the exchange rate

hopefully is a very good term    it remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth companies do n't see much of a reason to invest and all evidence points agrees    so what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich they are either buying back their own shares which is a or they are doing mergers and buyouts which are both at record highs at the moment here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap as there are less shares in the market mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it    then of course there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments share buy backs and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy

i think your understanding is correct as far as you describe but you do n't mention a critical detail to me   you also imply some penalty details for early withdrawal cancellation but you do n't state those terms in detail where and when is the interest paid   does it go into the same cd for compounding   does it get paid to another account   the description does say that it is priced at par so we at least know that the interest does n't have to be stuck unpaid within the cd until maturity but it also means you do n't necessarily get compounding at the cd rate without knowing where the interest goes and if it 's available for compounding be careful in how you compare it to other cds savings accounts   a structure might be a better option even at a lower apy

i have n't read the paper but have read similar papers before will likely read this paper here in a while    i can see the use for patents to a degree not the way they are now but in some form or another i think they should still exist i am not under the delusion of they help innovate i see them more or less as bringing stability to the marketplace business the changes i would like to see made is on certain patents or probably all patents that they expire at a certain time or if the patent is not put to use in a given time frame that it falls back into the public domain expired patents being fully searchable online for free    i would also disallow any patenting of genes or anything that nature has produced and or made if some one makes a new element or makes an absolutely new gene that has been seen or found any where else then sure patent it but something that already exists no    i agree that patents do stifle creativity and ultimately do harm us as a developing nation especially in it 's current iteration the solution i briefly went over would give a happy medium it would do much less harm than now and offer better innovation down the road the stability question with relation to business marketplace is how certain products are made and produced some people put a lot of time and effort into developing something and they need a little protection in doing it 7 years or so should be enough to recoup that back and then some after that time they can still produce said product but would have to compete against everyone else who uses a similar design    all in all i think every one can agree that the patent copyright system needs serious overhaul and not because it is too weak but it is because it was designed and implemented in a 20th century mindset not a 21st it worked somewhat well in the early 1900 's but since then it has not things move at a faster rate now than they did then as such in this day in age it is a lot stronger than it needs to be and needs to be back in a lot of areas it needs to be by people who know the area well and have no financial stake in the system one way or the other possibly people in academia with knowledge on the system and can offer valid arguments for it 's change and help to bring in common sense reforms to the system with how fucked up it is now it would probably be best to just scrap the system and design a new system from the ground up all currently held patents now have a 7 year life span if the patent is not in current use you have a year to show that you are working toward using the patent rather than just shelving it so no one else can use it

what do you think is a reasonable rate of return a reasonable rate really breaks down into three things opportunity cost what you need and risk appetite opportunity cost comes into play because whatever returns you make should at least exceed after expenses the next best option   typically the next best option is the risk free return you can get somewhere else which is typically a savings account or some other safe investment vehicle e.g. a guaranteed investment certificate gic bonds etc   but this opportunity cost could also be an alternative investment e.g. an index etf which is not necessarily risk free but it may represent the next best option risk appetite comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take on any investment and is completely subjective   this is typically how much can you sleep with losing amount what you need is the most subjective element   all things being equal e.g. identical risk profiles access to same next best thing to invest in if your cost of living expenses are only expected to go up 2 per year but mine are expected to go up 3 per year then my reasonable rate of return must exceed 3 but yours must only exceed 2 that said an appropriate return is whatever works for you period   nobody can tell you otherwise for your own investing what you can do is measure yourself against a benchmark   e.g. if your benchmark is the s&p 500 then the s&p 500 spdr etf is your opportunity cost e.g. what you would have made if you did n't do your own investing    in that way you are guaranteed the market return caveat the market return is not guaranteed to be positive as an aside do n't ever ever ever let someone else handle your money unless you want somebody else have your money there is nothing wrong with letting someone else handle your money provided you can live with the triple constraint above   investing takes time and effort and time and effort equals opportunity   if you can do something better with the time and effort you would spend to do your own investing then by all means do it   think about it if you have to spend 1 day a month managing your own investments but that day costs you $ 100 in foregone income e.g. you are a sole proprietor so every day is a working day that is $ 1,200 per year   but if you can find an investment advisor who will manage your books for you and costs you only $ 500 per year what is the better investment   if you do it yourself you are losing $ 1,200   if you pay someone you are losing $ 500   clearly it is cheaper to outsource despite what everyone says not everyone can be an investor   not everyone wants to live with the psychological emotional and mental effort of looking up stocks buying them and then second guessing themselves they are more than happy to pay someone to do that which also lets them point the finger at that person later if things go sideways

assuming you plan to buy a whole number of shares and have a maximum dollar value you intend to invest it may be better to wait for the split if the figures do n't quite work out nicely for example if you are going to invest $ 1,000 and the stock pre split is $ 400 and the split is 2 for 1 then you 'd buy 2 shares before the split unless you have an extra $ 200 to add meanwhile after the split you could buy 5 shares at $ 200 so that you invest all that you intend aside from that case it does n't really make a difference since the split is similar to getting 2 nickels for a dime which in each case is still a total value of 10 cents

years before retirement is n't related at all to the pretax ira roth ira decision except as income typically trends up over time for most people   if tax rates were constant both at income levels and over time roth and pretax would be identical   say you designate 100k for contribution 20 tax rate   80k contributed in roth vs. 100k contributed in pretax then 20 tax rate on withdrawal ends up with the same amount in your bank account after withdrawal you 're just moving the 20 tax grab from one time to another    if you choose roth it 's either because you like some of the flexibility like taking out contributions after 5 years or because you are currently paying a lower marginal rate than you expect you will be in the future either because you are n't making all that much this year or because you are expecting rates to rise due to political changes in our society   best is likely a diversified approach some of your money pretax some   at least some should be in a pretax ira because you get some tax free money each year thanks to the personal exemption   if you 're working off of 100 post tax you are paying more tax than you ought unless you 're getting enough social security to cover the whole 0 bucket and probably the 10 bucket also so for example you 're thinking you want 70k a year   assuming single and ignoring social security as it 's a very complicated issue joe taxpayer has a nice blog article regarding it that he links to in his answer you get $ 10k or so tax free then another $ 9k or so at 10 almost certainly lower than what you pay now   so you could aim to get $ 19k out of your pre tax ira then and out of your post tax ira meaning you only pay $ 900 in taxes on your income   of course if you 're in the 25 bucket now you may want to use more pretax since you could then take that out all the way to around $ 50k standard exemption + $ 40k or so point where 25 hits   but on the other hand social security would probably change that equation back to using primarily roth if you 're getting a decent social security check

wealthsimple lists their prices as follows those are the fees you pay over and above what you pay for the underlying etfs management fees but why not just invest in the etfs yourself the canadian couch potato website shows some sample portfolios the etf option has an average management expense ratio very similar to that of the etfs used by wealthsimple but without the additional management fee rebalance once or twice a year and you cut your fees from approximately if investing mid six figures to 0.17 for very little work is it worth it to you well that depends on how much you have to invest and how much effort you are willing to put in wealthsimple is n't particularly unreasonable with their fees but the fees do look a bit high once you are in to the six figures of investing on the other hand i often recommend tangerine 's mutual funds to my friends who are looking at investing for retirement those mutual funds last time i checked cost that 's about twice what wealthsimple is charging but they are easy to understand and easy to invest in a good choice for my friends looking to invest $ 1,000 $ 50,000 in my opinion so and understanding this is just my personal opinion i think wealthsimple fits in a niche where tangerine mutual funds carry too high a cost for you but you do n't want to do all the management yourself even if this is just an hour or so of work a couple of times a year i wish they were cheaper but their pricing makes sense for a lot of people in my opinion do they make sense for you if you are looking at investing less than $ 10,000 i 'd stick with an option like tangerine only because that 's an easier option if investing more than $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 i think you are paying a bit much for what they offer but many people pay much much much more for their investments

i believe that it 's not possible for the public to know what shares are being exchanged as shorts because broker dealers not the exchanges handle the shorting arrangements   i do n't think exchanges can even tell the difference between a person selling a share that belongs to her vs. a share that she 's just borrowing   there are sec regulations requiring some traders to declare that trades are shorts but a i do n't think this applies to all traders b it only applies to the sells and c this information is n't public that being said you can view the short interest in a symbol using any of a number of tools such as nasdaq 's here   this is often cited as an indicator similar to what you proposed though i do n't know how helpful it would be from an intra day perspective

as far as the specific price it depends so much on the area and the house and other things   70k could be a perfectly reasonable offer or it could be an insulting lowball   if they just lowered it from 95 to 85 for example 70 is pretty low to start off   but who knows to answer the closing costs side of things though the reason those are sometimes paid by seller rather than just dropping the sales price some is that it makes it easier for the buyer if the buyer does n't have much cash on hand   from the seller 's point of view it 's all the same money giving you a discount on the sale price vs. covering closing costs except for the small difference of the realtor 's commission which would be slightly lower in the lower sales price example but usually that 's not a significant factor in total cost   ie vs how much having the 3k less on hand and instead in your mortgage is worth to you as a buyer is of course up to you   if you have plenty of cash on hand for the down payment and closing costs then paying closing costs yourself is probably in your best interest as the seller typically assumes buyers value reduced zero closing costs at more than 100 face value

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

i mean it does n't really apply to a lease buy decision in a home   the variability due to the variables i discussed makes it not worth the analysis when you 're talking about return differences of maybe 1 2   even if your house costs $ 1 million that 's only a difference of $ 10,000 maybe if there 's no difference in the other variables but there will be   my point is that it 's not worth doing   dcf models are used for valuation of large projects not simple home buying problems   there are way better ways to evaluate such a simple problem

of course you do   you can sell it wreck it do whatever you want with it   of course some things may void warranty or whatever but since you do in fact own the vehicle it is technically yours to do with as you please     did you know that you can bore the engine of a car to increase performance   not saying you should there are lots of pros and cons there and it requires an individual with specialized knowledge to do it who you will have to pay for his service but it is doable   should you be upset that this was n't already done by the manufacturer     did you know that lots of vehicles are equipped with gps functionality   if your car can display a compass there is a decent chance that you already have the basics of what you need to set up gps in the vehicle   should you be upset that your vehicle does n't have gps   but you ca n't boil it down that far   well i suppose you can but it makes everything cost more for everyone   when you buy a tesla you are n't just buying a car   you are buying into the company   they make updates fix programming issues etc and this requires access   they chose to market their vehicles differently and so they sell them differently   alternatively they could have 2 separate assembly lines one for the 60 discontinued and one for the 75   now this will equate to both cars costing significantly more than they currently do but hey at least you have the right battery right

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

a company can issue different kinds of shares for example some kinds of shares may get preference in dividends or payment in event of company bankruptcy preferred shares are an example of this a company might have several kinds of preferred shares and a common stock here is a good explanation see too the wikipedia article about preferred stock toronto bank td is an example of a company that has fourteen different preferred share issues each with its own listing on the toronto stock exchange tse and symbol td has one kind of common stock which is also listed on the tse however td common equity trades much more actively than the preferred shares remember that preferred stock is a different security type than common stock e.g. common has voting rights preferred does not

gt well if you were n't such an entitled prick you 'd know that it just flat out is n't as simple for some as find a better job or make more money or improve your lot in life as you have suggested here many different ways   yes true   life is harder for some than it is for others   welcome to life   gt;there are countless reasons why that just simply is not possible and hence why there is in fact a need to require a living wage no matter how hard you cover your ears and scream if you were n't so self important maybe you 'd see that   how does acknowledging the facts of life make me a self important entitle prick   you know absolutely nothing about me   how i grew up   what i do now   nothing you 're just mad because someone told you you are responsible for your own life and that just sounds too difficult for you    the fact that you think a minimum wage will solve the poor problem tells me you know literally nothing about economics

you claimed that you could pick out stolen funds hidden within the block chain by examining transactions   i pointed out that stock transactions are all widely published and asked if you could pick out which trades were done using illicit information   the parallel is clear

okay fine great i think you fail to see my point   experiencing someone dying on the table does not alter the reality of what is behind america 's relatively high health care costs and its not an experience that will give one a special insight into the causes of high prices   going back to your first point economists have looked into the exact same cause you proposed they have weighted its impact on healthcare and its not the largest driving force in way american healthcare costs so much

no the reinvestment is done as a courtesy consider one can have say 100 shares of a $ 50 stock a 2 dividend is $ or $ it would be a pretty bad deal if brokers charged you even $ 5 for that trade when cap gains and dividends are grouped as you suggest it refers to mutual funds my funds will have a year end dividend and cap gain distribution in a non retirement account one has to pay the tax due and be sure to add this to your cost basis as it 's money you are effectively adding to your account it does not mean cap gain the same as when you sell your shares of apple for a huge gain   those check boxes seem to offer you a chance to put all your holding on the same reinvestment plan for div cap gain you should also be able to choose one by one what you 'd like to do

the laws as written at the time required a pretty high burden of proof to show fraud   there were a lot of words like having to show intent or of the risks for it to be illegal those are always tough cases to win and the regulators themselves were reluctant to ride the banks too hard because that just reinforces the regulators own incompetence

tourism is down and we ’re to lose 2 billion in the industry overall this year thanks to trumps travel ban   we do n’t have many tourists from those countries either but the rest of the world looks at us sees what we ’re doing and is freaked the fuck out     canada has universities that are hugely benefitting   students do n’t want to go to a country where they think they will be unwelcome   smart people from india and china look at trump and they make the decision that serves their interests the best   canada is more welcoming and it does n’t have nearly the same level racial discomfort that trump has brought   we also get people from japan and korea and they hate trump because of the tensions he has created in the region   they feel like   we also get a lot of smart people from latin america and it goes without saying that latinos are scared of the atmosphere he has created   he is fucking shit up big time when it comes to immigration   he is making the u.s. a less desirable place to go and it ’s impacting our ability to recruit talent from around the world   that does n’t even begin to delve into his overall anti science policies   he ’s an epic disaster

gt the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else   i do n't agree with this there 's a very good roi on investments in innovation i have applied for subsidies for research and innovation myself for my government a roi of 2000 in 5 years is what they are looking for but they use a different metric when i say i create a new job that did not exist that pays euro year this is added to the expected profit new jobs at suppliers and customers are also counted everything is taxed between 30 and 50 so the roi for the government is there   the reason innovation in the states is is because the obama administration failed to invest in research and innovation   gt;the actual price of money itself is manufactured   of course it is

gt okay why   because the only modern justification for the existence of a nation is the social contract    gt we have seen that corporations will push limits regularly which shows little respect for the law or other people 's property   without the concept of corporate person hood a impartial judicial system to settle disagreements and enforcement significantly more powerful than all actors corporations would have little reason to heed claims of property   ownership would become a question of what you can control not what you made traded for    exactly that 's why we have the social contract and thus services like police and civil courts that ensure the mutual respect for each other 's property   but for the vast majority of interactions enforcement wo n't be required since you want your property respected as well it 's the golden rule   gt tell me why   because once again mandatory public healthcare is based on forced redistribution of wealth which is a violation of the social contract i 'm quite sure i explained this already multiple times   gt it does n't solve the problem of how the money sucks money to the top   please elaborate as to why that is a problem in the first place

yes when exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction so if the stock is worth $ 1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $ 0.50 you will spend $ 500 when you exercise your options if you hold those shares and the company is then worth $ 0 you lost $ 500 i have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance please verify with your accountant to be sure

you read it right todd 's warning is well taken i do n't know the numbers involved but have a brilliant suggestion that may help a solo 401(k is simple to qualify for any bit of declared side income will do once the account is set up a transfer from iras is simple the solo 401(k can offer a loan provision as any other 401(k and you can borrow up to 50 max of $ 50 k for any reason with a 5 year payback the standard rate is the fee is minimal usually $ 50-$100   all the warnings of ira loans apply but the risk of job loss the largest objection to 401 loans is n't there the fact that you have 6 months to set this up is part of what prompts this suggestion   note any strategies like this are n't for everyone there are folk who need to access quick cash and this solves the issue in two ways both low rate and simple access phil already stated he is confident to return the money the only thing that prompted my answer is there 's real risk the 60 days a bit too short for any business deal

no they are n't they either ca n't afford fast food burgers anymore or they are willing to pay a little extra because they are ashamed of eating at mcdonald 's   all fast food is roughly equivalent the differences are just perception and marketing   we probably all share the same concept of what taco bell and chipotle represent taco bell 's are dirty and filled with while chipotle 's are for younger people who enjoy fresh food that wo n't make you shit yourself   they both sell fake mexican food with ingredients that come from god knows where and are hastily assembled by surly teenagers   is one better than the other   that 's entirely subjective   is one more likely to make your sick   probably not both companies probably have roughly equivalent quality control procedures   does one have a better atmosphere   personally i think that can be up to confirmation bias   you see taco bell 's at gas stations and highway rest stops in poorer neighborhoods and taco bell has also been around for almost 40 years longer than chipotle so of course some of the stores are a bit more run down   americans are n't over fast food at all there is just more competition and the competition has great marketing

do n't get all the hype about tesla they ca n't make a profit and they ca n't deliver their products on time and yet everyone has such high hopes for musk and his vision what am i missing    edit thank you for the replies this is leading to some great discussion although have to agree with some comments below that getting downvoted for raising reasonable business questions in a biz sub is frustrating    adding a few things that still trouble tesla burned through $ 1.2 billion in cash in the second quarter almost double the $ million it went through in the first quarter and $ 2 billion spending is forecast for the second half of the year negative cash flow aside a lot of the hype is focused on the model 3 but how about of model s and x from model 3   there seems to be a somewhat following of tesla and musk but i do wonder if other that are ramping up their electric vehicles and self driving r&amp;d and have their finances in order is n't a safer bet
