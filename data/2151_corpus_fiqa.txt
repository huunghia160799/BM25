the stock market is just like any other market but stocks are bought and sold here just like you buy and sell your electronics at the electronics market this is a place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares or stocks or equity no matter what you call it what are these shares   a share is nothing but a portion of ownership of a company suppose a company has 100 shares issued to it and you were sold 10 out of those it literally means you are a 10 owner of the company why do companies sell shares companies sell shares to grow or expand suppose a business is manufacturing or producing and selling goods or services that are high in demand the owners would want to take advantage of it and increase the production of his goods or services and in order to increase production he would need money to buy land or equipment or labor etc now either he could go get a loan by something or he could partner with someone who could give him money in exchange for some portion of the ownership of the company this way the owner gets the money to expand his business and make more profit and the lender gets a portion of profit every time the company makes some now if the owner decides to sell shares rather than getting a loan that 's when the stock market comes into the picture why would a person want to trade stocks first of all please remember that stocks were never meant to be traded you always invest in stocks what 's the difference trading is short term and investing is long term in very simple language it 's the greed of humans which led to this concept of trading stocks a person should only buy stocks if he believes in the business the company is doing and sees the potential of growth back to the question a person would want to buy stocks of the company because how does a stock market help society look around you for the answer to this question let me give you a start and i wish everyone reading this post to add at least one point to the answer corporations in general allow many people come together and invest in a business without fear that their investment will cause them undue liability because shareholders are ultimately not liable for the actions of a corporation the cornerstone north american case of how corporations add value is by allowing many investors to have put money towards the railroads that were built across america and canada for the stock market in particular by making it easier to trade shares of a company once the company sells them the number of people able to conveniently invest grows exponentially this means that someone can buy shares in a company without needing to knock door to door in 5 years trying to find someone to sell to participating in the stock market creates liquidity which is essentially the ease with which stocks are converted into cash high liquidity reduces risk overall and it means that those who want risk because high risk often creates high reward can buy shares and those who want low risk because say they are retiring and do n't have a risk appetite anymore can sell shares

in finance form is function and while a reason for a trade could be anything but since the result of a trade is a change in value it could be presumed that one seeks to receive a change in value stock company there may have been more esoteric examples but currently possession of a company total ownership of its assets actually is by percentage or a glorified frequently called a share   percentage companies are usually sole proprietorship and partnerships but partnerships can now trade in units   share companies are usually corporations with shares a company can be divided into almost totally indistinguishable units   this allows for more flexible ownership so individuals can trade them without having to change the company contract considering the ease of trade it could be assumed that common stock contract provisions were formulated to provide for such an ease motivation to trade this could be anything but it seems those with the largest ownership of common stock have lots of wealth so it could be assumed that people at least want to own stocks to own wealth shorting might be a little harder to reason but i personally assume that the motivation to trade is still to increase wealth social benefit of the stock market assuming that ownership in a company is socially valuable and that the total value of ownership is proportional to the social value provided the social benefit of a stock market is that it provided the means to scale ownership through convenience speed and reliability

i rather like the of money by this comes in several formats there 's a video version a written version and an audio version this book covers the history of financial instruments it covers the rise of money the history of bonds and stocks insurance and hedge funds real estate and the spread of finance across the world it is a great introduction to finance though its focus is very definitely on the history it does not cover more advanced topics and will not leave you with any sort of financial plan but it 's a great way to get a broad overview and historical understanding of money and markets i strongly recommend both the video and the written or audio version

i knew before i clicked that this was going to refer to i do n't mean to his scholarship but he 's clearly a guy with an agenda for example the reason this number is so outrageous is because 2010 was a terrific year for the stock market and a to bad year for employment and wage growth stocks tend to be a leading indicator while job growth is a trailing one in fact also tries to make hay by comparing the first two years of this recovery with the entirety of the much longer 90 's and 00 's booms if you target your analysis at years when the market has recovered but jobs have n't of course you 'll see greater income gains for the investor class   but by that same token could have been putting out press releases for studies in 2008 showing how the rich were getting absolutely screwed by losing the lion 's share of their income as the market tanked while ordinary folks were perhaps losing only a little because the full force of job losses had n't hit yet but he did n't afaik

i am actually partial to the idea of negative taxation systems here in australia we have the work for the dole program which is essentially what the author describes but it is inefficient and it would be far more efficient to dramatically reduce the minimum wage and introduce a negative tax rate or rather bracket the tax rate such that it enters negative territory at some point this way employers can afford to employ more staff and people would still be compensated through the tax system and end up reasonably well off so long as the compensation is fair i do n't see how this is not preferable to a tax and transfer system where the government taxes with one hand and gives with the other

the company will have to pay 20 tax on its profits does n't matter how these profits are earned profits = income minus all money you spend to get the income   however you ca n't just take the profits out of the company the company can pay you a salary on which income tax national insurance and employer 's national insurance have to be paid at the usual rate the company can pay you a dividend on which tax has to be paid and the company can pay money into the director 's pension fund which is tax free   since the amount of company revenue can be of interest i 'd be curious myself what the revenue of such a company would be and if the company makes losses i 'm sure hmrc wo n't allow you to get any tax advantages from such losses

j gruber 's consulting reports for the various states minnesota wisconsin etc     and the article it addresses which included some numbers from the reports     note that gruber has made a whole spectrum of claims from initially claiming that premiums would go down for a consulting agreement with the obama administration to later revisions showing significant increases to varying degrees depending on the individuals specific demographic to wit   ’s new reports are in direct contrast obama ’s words and with claims gruber himself made in 2009 then the economics professor said that based on figures provided by the independent congressional budget office health care reform will significantly reduce not increase non group premiums   gt;during his presentation to wisconsin officials in august 2011 gruber revealed that while about 57 percent of those who get their insurance through the individual market will benefit in one way or another from the law ’s an even larger majority of the individual market will end up paying drastically more overall   the application of tax subsidies 59 percent of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent gruber reported   gt;the reason for this is that an estimated 40 percent of wisconsin residents who are covered by individual market insurance do n’t meet the affordable care act ’s minimum coverage requirements under the affordable care act they will be required to purchase more expensive plans   for his own explanation for the expected health insurance rate hikes gruber told that his reports reflect the high cost of folding state high risk pools into the federal government 's exchange without using the money the state was already spending to subsidize those high risk pools   note emphasis added     note 2 to begin with an average increase of 31 qualifies as significant hell it 's a lot more than merely significant that 's a huge increase and secondly that is an average meaning that while some of the people in that 59 will probably not see such a high increase a fairly large segment and per the provisions of the act versus current premium calculation methods we know these will be young healthy singles and especially males will face increases that are substantially higher than 31 and in fact will probably be in the nature of double or triple previous premiums as would be required in order to meet another provision of the act that highest premiums for older pool members can not be higher than 3x that of the youngest lowest tier premiums and if the company is to balance the books it can only bring down the one end if it makes a compensating increase at the other end   none of that is rocket science and it is entirely predictable the only things that would be odd would be that anyone should expect anything different and that gruber 's initial claims of across the board lower costs were ever accepted in the first place

option prices are computed by determining the cost of obtaining the option returns using a strategy that trades the underlying asset continuously   it sounds like what you are describing is rapidly trading the option in order to obtain returns similar to those of the stock   the equality goes both ways    if the option is appropriately priced then a strategy that replicates stock returns using the option will cost the same as buying the stock because you ca n't trade continuously you wo n't actually be able to replicate the stock return and it may seem like you are making arbitrage profit puts may seem abnormally expensive but you do so by bearing tail risk i.e. selling puts loses more money than owning the associated stock if an unusually bad event occurs

first decide on your asset allocation are you looking for a fund with 60 stocks risky stuff or 40 or 20 second look for funds that have a mix of stocks and bonds good keywords would be target retirement lifecycle balanced conservative moderate allocation as you discover these funds probably the fund website but at least will tell you the percentage in stocks and risk assets vs. in conservative bonds look for funds that have the percentage you decided on or as close to it as possible third build a list of funds that meet your allocation goal and compare the details are they based on index funds or are they actively managed what is the expense ratio is the fund from a reputable company you could certainly ask more questions here if you have several candidates and are n't sure how to choose for investing in us dollars one can't go wrong choice is vanguard and they have several suitable funds but unfortunately if you spend in then you should probably invest in that currency and i do n't know anything about funds in israel update two other options here one is a financial advisor who agrees to do rebalancing for you if you get a cheap one it could be worth it two is that some 401k plans have an automatic rebalancing feature where you have multiple funds but you can set it up so their computer auto rebalances you that 's almost as good as having a single fund though it does still encourage some mental accounting so you 'd have to try to only look at the total balance not the individual fund balances over time anyway both of these could be alternatives ways to go on autopilot besides a single fund

if there are no traded options in a company you can get your broker to write otc options but this may not be possible given some restrictions on accounts going short on futures may also be an option you can also open a downside cfd contract for difference on the stock but will have to have margin posted against it so will have to hold cash or possibly liquid assets if your aum is large enough to cover the margin which is cash in the portfolio that needs to be factored into any portfolio calculations as a cost diversifying into uncorrelated stock or shorting correlated but low div yield stock would also have the same effect stop loss orders would probably not be appropriate as it is not the price of the stock that you are concerned with but mitigating all price changes and just receiving the dividend on the stock warning in a crash almost all stocks become suddenly correlated so be aware that might cause you a short term loss cfds are complex and require a degree of sophistication before you can trade them well but as you seem to understand options they should not be too hard to understand

as far as i agree to everyone saying that you should stop borrowing etc i see a lot of sense of getting balance transfer cards if you are actually paying it off considering a scenario you have a cc with balance of $ 5000 on each at roughly interest which results in interest per year your minimum due is where you are paying $ 100 mo for only interest and ~$10 mo to cover your balance if minimum is all you can pay with your current cash flow yes do a balance transfer assuming your transfer cost is 3 and 0 interest for 21 months as many ccs do now your cost will be $ 150 but paying off $ 110 month for 21 months you will pay off roughly $ 2000 off your balance instead of if you were paying only your minimum due after 21 months you 'll have a balance of instead of $ 4800 and then you can repeat if your cash flow gets better please make as many more bigger payments any time you can to reduce the balance and you 'll pay off sooner

for federal taxes the rule is fairly straight forward assuming that nothing else changes during the year   if you know your marginal tax rate the rate that your last dollar of income is taxed at last year then adding or subtracting an allowance on the w-4 form will move the amount withheld by rate x personal exemption amount the personal exemption for federal taxes in 2017 is $ 4,050 lowering the number of allowances on the federal w-4 increases the amount of money withheld during the year   so for your federal w-4 form lowering the number of allowances by one if you are in the 25 bracket will cause an additional or   a year to be withheld of course making the change of the way trough the year will mean that it will only increase the   the amount withheld the rest of the year by $ or for the rest of the year state taxes can be more complex due to issues regarding tax brackets and the differences in how they calculate their taxes most state websites have a worksheet for making an adjustment   to their version of the w-4 here is the form form for california in your situation getting the numbers on the federal and state forms will be much more complex because your combined   income for 2017 will be significantly different than your combined income for 2016   in the case of multiple incomes getting the withholding correct is much harder even with stable income the trick is that making the adjustment on the job with the highest income may not move the amount withheld as much as you expect for example if the largest income is only withheld at the 15 rate but your combined income from all your combined jobs results in you being in the 25 bracket then the above calculation would only move the amount withheld by $ instead of $ 590 a couple of notes the number of allowances on the federal and state w-4 forms do n't have to match mine almost never do the number of allowances on the w-4 forms does n't have to match the number of exemptions on the 1040 form

gt;well reserve requirements concern as the name suggests the reserves e.g. a position on the balance sheet   yes the book value of equity is not affected however when the market value experiences a steep decline you find those that hold deposits begin moving them out of the bank investment fear and business fear tend to move together with financial institutions that directly impacts the reserve requirements   gt;but sharp price drops in fact can help you to raise equity simply because your ratios improved p e p b in fact any ratio that includes the price part and the stock became cheaper   not when there is bankruptcy or solvency issues that become present obviously an investor wants to buy low and sell high but if there is a substantial risk of bankruptcy the common stockholder will demand a premium unattainable by most non growth firms i.e. biotech tech etc   that is the issue with france liquidity issues stem from systemic risk but those french banks also possess significant firm risk due to their exposure to sovereign debt once those banks mark all of their holdings to market they will realize substantial losses bnp recently recorded a nearly $ 1b write down

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

a bad customer is n't someone who needs a lot of support due to a situation like bob 's    bad customer is someone who generates work you get nothing but complaints everything is about how fucked up your software is etc etc etc it might also be a customer who 's trying to use your product wrong    there are also customers that really are resource pits note that after that one call they never heard from bob again in fact a customer that calls for two hours a month would use more than bob did over the course of the year so if bob called back the next day to ask about setting up a printer and the next day to set up internet connectivity and the day after that for help with the windows setup thing again and the next day for more printer help then you start to get into evaluating the value of the customer    there 's some judgement involved here the ceo felt that if he got bob up and running then bob would be good to go and he was right

you become a teacher generally k-12 but i have heard from the doe    that teachers at state schools qualify as well this is not 100 correct teaching in certain disciplines and areas stem special education title 1 schools can qualify for student loan debt forgiveness depending on the type of debt for instance i believe the federal loan forgiveness program only covers debt remaining after 10 years of teaching in a qualified discipline   do verify this as it 's been several years since i looked into the matter the doe has a student loan forgiveness program but the scope of it is somewhat narrow   i would encourage anyone considering this approach to investigate it in detail before committing to a career in teaching some states have similar programs but they typically have limitations as well

is evaluating stocks just a loss of time if the stock is traded very much not at all making sound investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of companies will help you to do decide whether a given company is right for you and your risk appetite investing is not a zero sum game and you can achieve a positive long term or short term depending on what you 're after outcome for yourself without compromising your ability to sleep at night if you take the time to become acquainted with the companies that you are investing in how can you ensure that your evaluation is more precise than the    market ones which consists of the evaluation of thousands of people    and professionals for the average individual the answer is often simply you probably can not but you do n't have to set the bar that high what you can do is ensure that your evaluation gives you a better understanding of your investment and allows you to better align it with your investment objectives you do n't have to beat the professionals you just have to lose less money than you would by paying them to make the decision for you

this seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up if you 're set up as a sole proprietor then the solo 401k contributions whether employee or employer will be deducted from your gross income   thus they do n't reduce it if you 're set up as an s corp then the employer contributions similar to large employer contributions will be deducted from wages and wo n't show up in box 1 on your w-2 so they would reduce your gross income   note employee contributions also would go away from box 1 but would still be in box 3 and 5 for fica payroll tax purposes this is nicely discussed in detail here the irs page that discusses this in more harder to understand detail is here separately i think a discussion of gross income is as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships the irs defines it in publication 501 as gross income     gross income is all income you receive in the form of money goods property and services that is not exempt from tax if you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours for a list of community property states see community property states under married filing separately later self employed persons     if you are self employed in a business that provides services where products are not a factor your gross income from that business is the gross receipts if you are self employed in a business involving manufacturing merchandising or mining your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold in either case you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources so i think that regardless of 401(k contributions your gross income is your gross receipts if you 're a contractor it 's probably the total listed on your

my point was that we have the safest debt for right i agree that we can still afford to spend money to fix the economy the problem is that the spending we have been doing so far is n't doing a whole lot considering what we are investing we have spent trillions and our gdp growth rate is two thirds what it was over the last 70 years if we were still at the beginning of the recovery that could be acceptable but it 's been three and a half years now we are going to need to start getting some bang for our buck to turn this around   if we are still doing the same thing two years from now investors may not have faith in the safety of the united states anymore they will realize we have taken on 30 years of deficits and then taken trillions more to save the economy if we are still stagnant the world will start to question how great our economy really is and whether we even deserve the world reserve currency   so yes i agree that we currently have the safest debt in the world and can try to save our economy through deficit spending i did off on a tangent but i think it was a necessary point we need to make sure that the deficit spending we do from here on in actually creates real value for the economy and gets real gdp growth    the reason i am sick of the argument is that many people seem to have this idea that the u.s. will always have the reserve currency and the world will always consider it to be the safest debt we can keep going this way for now but if we do n't back up that claim then sooner or later they wo n't buy it anymore i agree with the government spending but we need to spend in areas that are going to generate real gdp growth rather than randomly building projects and hoping for the best   edit so in other words i think i agree with you i just want to make sure people understand how things can get in the future and we do n't all buy into a sense of entitlement that we can spend whatever we want forever

the pros and cons of investing in a closed end fund both stem from the fact that the price per share is likely to differ from the net asset value nav of the underlying assets that could work to your advantage if the fund is selling for less than nav or at a discount then you get the benefit of the bargain and hope to sell the shares in the future for par or even a premium more than nav on the other hand if you buy such a fund at a premium you stand to have a relative loss if the value of the fund goes back to par or a discount compared to nav that 's because a closed end fund has a fixed number of shares with the assets continually being reinvested in essence you are buying out an existing shareholder of the fund at a price determined by supply and demand this differs from an open end fund in which your contribution creates new shares all other things being equal then the fund has to invest your money and charges you a fee for the service on exactly a pro rata basis with other investors in the fund meaning that you will enter and exit such a fund at par in either case your return depends mainly on the performance of the underlying assets but there are premium discount issues for investing in a closed end fund

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

this is how its done   i am a certain french bank aka   i have some piigs debt i can use this as collateral at face value 100 with the ecb in order to secure cash lets say i use 1mn of italian debt this has an clean of 88   i use that 88 to get me 100 1mn of cash from which i buy another for 88 of which i use as collateral pledged to the ecb to get this get another   so now i am long 3 all pledged to the ecb and i have 36 in cash and i owe the ecb in 3 years   remember the yield on my shitty is a lot higher than the interest on the deposits   secondly i have three years so i do n't need to give a fuck about the mark to market on the notes i could even buy a 2 year and n month note maturing just before so i can make some free yield at the ecb 's expense   also this frees up 36 in cash of which i can use to meet short term funding instead of tapping the bond market this trade can be made infinitely although the ecb might catch on   you can view it as getting a mortgage on your house to buy another house then mortgaging house 2 to buy house 3 and so on

your inference in 1 is incorrect   the million dollars he has contributed is going to be part of the assets of the fund   this is common practice and is a way for the founder to express confidence that the fund will make money   he wants you to come up with a model that he can then use to trade those assets   presumably he will give you some money if he uses your model and it works regarding 2 there are lots of ways of getting data   sometimes you can buy it directly from the exchange   you can also buy from vendors like   there are lots of such vendors   since he makes a big deal about saying it 's expensive i 'm assuming he is talking about data at relatively high frequency not daily which would be cheap   stock data is still not bad   complete us data would be a few thousand dollars maybe 20 k at the most   for someone sitting at home with no capital that 's a lot of money but for a hedge fund it 's nothing as an institutional investor your broker will give you a data feed that will provide all prices in real time but not historically   if he 's been in operation a while he could have just saved the prices as they came out of the pipe   i do n't think that 's the case here though based on how young he is and how little money is involved in short he paid for some data and has encrypted it in such a way that he can legally share it for free   supposedly his method preserves the structure so that you could write a trading model based on the encrypted data and it would work on real data   once you have a good trading model you sell it to him and he will use it to trade his million dollars and whatever other money he is able to gather

an important risk is that the government may decide to change the rules for example prior to 2011 over the counter drugs like aspirin tylenol etc were eligible expenses you could use your hsa money to buy as much as you wanted beginning in 2011 those rules changed now if you want to spend your hsa money on tylenol you need a prescription for it the value of hsa dollars was diminished in the sense that the universe of eligible expenses was diminished no one knows what the hsa rules will be in the future what will be eligible expenses who will be eligible providers what kind of compliance paperwork will be required what kind of fees will be imposed personally i 'm a great believer in hsas i 've saved in one for years but remember that the government makes the rules regarding their use they 've changed the rules to the detriment of hsa owners at least once i wo n't be surprised if it continues

no do n't bother   you need to decide what you are saving for and how much risk you are prepared to take it would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years and could n't afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash   typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity you want to protect your capital   this is n't you at 28 you might be saving for a wedding a deposit on a house possibly for school fees or for eventual retirement   it does n't sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in july 2022 keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice   some of this in a current account some might be in a savings account that does n't pay interest if you make withdrawals after that i 'd stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice there will presumably be local tax considerations too and add in most of your monthly savings too   these should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house if there is a recession and a stock market dip you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover   and if you are intending to buy a house then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house of course the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job are unemployed for a considerable period of time burn through your emergency fund and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses    you might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support which would change your tolerance for risk   having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse   so if you do n't want to put all your non emergency savings into the stock market you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate but ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years

you ca n't tell for sure   if there was such a technique then everyone would use it and the price would instantly change to reflect the future price value however trade volume does say something   if you have a lemonade stand and offer a large glass of ice cold lemonade for 1c on a hot summer day i 'm pretty sure you 'll have high trading volume   if you offer it for $ 5000 the trading volume is going to be around zero since the supply of lemonade is presumably limited at some point dropping the price further is n't going to increase the number of transactions    trade volumes reflect to some degree the difference of valuations between buyers and sellers and the supply and demand   it 's another piece of information that you can try looking at and interpreting   if you can be more successful at this than the majority of others on the market not very likely you may get a small edge   i 'm willing to bet that high frequency trading algorithms factor volume into their trading decisions among multiple other factors

you understood it pretty right every fiscal year which runs from april 6 year y to april 5 year you can deposit a total this number is subject to an annual increase by hmrc into your isas you can open 2 new isa every year but the amount deposited to those isas shall not excess in total from the tax year some isas now permit you to replace any funds you have withdrawn without using up your allowance it used to be that if you deposited k and then withdrew k you could not pay in to that isa again within that tax year as you had already used your full allowance under new flexible isa rules this would be allowed providing you replace the funds in the same isa account and within the same tax year strongly recommend that you check the small prints related to your account to make sure this is he case any gains and losses on the investments held in the isa accounts are for you to take i.e. if you make investment gains of k this does not reduces your allowance you will still be able to deposit or whatever hmrc increases that number to in the following year you are also allowed to consolidate your isas you can ask bank a to transfer the amount held into an isa with bank held with bank b. this is usually done by filling a special form with the bank that will held the money post transactions again here be very careful do not withdraw the money to transfer it yourself as this would count against the k limit instead follow the procedures from the bank finally if you do n't use your allowance for a given year you can not use it during the following year i.e. if you do n't deposit the k this year then you can not deposit k next year nb i used the word deposit it does not matter to hmrc if the money get invested or not if you are in a rush on april 4th just make sure the money is wired into the isa account by the 5th no need to rush and make bad investment decision you can invest it later   hope it helps

as a sole proprietor the tax liability of your business is calculated based on combining your business income with your personal income together   it is good advice to keep all personal and business financial matters separate this makes it easier to prove to the irs that all your business expenses are actually business related in this case however the two items tax payment for personal income vs tax payment for business income are what you can do however for your own personal records is calculate how much of your tax payment relates to your business i would n't get complicated about this i would simply take the net income of your business as a of your taxable income and multiply that against your tax payment ie if your business net income is $ 10,000 and your total taxable income is $ 50,000 and you paid $ 6,000 in taxes i would record that 20 of the $ 6k was related to business income if you have a separate bank account for your sole proprietorship you could make a transfer to your personal account of $ 1,200 and then make the $ 6k payment from your personal account remember that tax payments for either your sole proprietorship and your personal income will be treated the same federal tax payments are not tax deductible and state tax payments are tax deductible whether they were paid for your sole proprietorship or the rest of your personal income so even though this method is simplistic for example it does n't factor in that different investment income types earned personally will have a lower rate than your sole proprietorship income any difference would n't have an impact on any future tax liability this would only be for your own personal record keeping

i feel like this has nothing to do with income and as such rmds will not really help or harm you after a person passes credit card companies are unlikely to collect any outstanding balance   debts can not be inherited however assets can be made to stand for debts   many assets pass to heirs without the probate process and in some cases all of them pass this way   this leaves creditors with nothing and having to write off the balance even if assets do pass through probate heirs may dispute the creditors   in that case credit card balances may not be high enough justify hiring a lawyer to fight for payment or if they do the judge may be and offer nothing or pennies on the dollar     the bottom line is that they probably see you or your demographic as a poor credit risk and reduced their exposure by lowering your limit   while that is not what they told you they probably have to carefully structure what they say to avoid any discrimination claims

i recently requested an off schedule escrow analysis we refinanced a house in august and the servicer got confused about when the home owner 's insurance was due in october they refunded the insurance money to us in september that combined with the fact that the insurance amount was different than what they expected made me request the escrow analysis that way i can decide whether to pay up the escrow account now or do it over the next year the servicer agent just said that the monthly payment amounts might change again in january when they do the usual analysis if you like to set up automatic payments that would be a downside i have n't done that yet so not a problem for me

i agree completely   i do n't always agree with john cochrane but when i do i agree completely   i think heavy reliance on either approach to pricing is generally a bad idea   equilibrium models always include something that you 're supposed to inherently know but never do   no arbitrage models do n't necessarily say anything that you do n't in some mathematical sense already know   so you 're either stuck with unknown parameters or you ca n't explain why you 're something is worth what you say it is beyond derp other people are doing it   so i think if buy side people made some use of no arbitrage models they 'd have a better understanding of the parameters they 're making up and if sell side people sometimes used equilibrium models they 'd have a better grasp of what 's going on economically   also it would have the beneficial effect of reminding people that their models are always wrong even if they 're frequently useful

i got a ba in econ from a mid tier public school in ca and i graduated near the trough of the great recession so my experience may not represent what current and future graduates can expect it took a couple of years of shit jobs but i eventually got into banking a matter of who you know and after almost 5 years i could n't stand it anymore so i am starting my ms in econ at an also mid tier public ca school i ca n't compare to cs and my advice will differ from 's   1 never assume that jobs will we thrown at you especially a job that you actually want like and will make a career the job market is strong and you ought to be able to get an entry level analyst position if you can show you have strong econometrics many schools require you to do a research paper for your senior seminar instead of a graduation exam i recommend to choose a topic with good data available   2 all the government jobs i 've looked at required at least a master 's that said the roi on a phd is rarely worth it if you have to take on debt to do it you might be able to get your foot in the door with a bachelor 's but you wo n't be able to progress up the job ladder i suggest being a little more open minded about potential employers there are way more options when you consider consulting or business development for larger corporations   3 economics majors make the most out of the social scientists by far last i checked it was 60 80k depending on local market but i imagine that trails cs majors significantly you should be able to afford a decent standard of living in either field so certainly consider more on the basis of what kind of work you get the most satisfaction from   4 with an undergrad degree you will start in local government you may then be able to jump to state and then federal levels after 5 10 years experience but still may find it difficult if you forgo the master 's i have not personally worked as an economist but i do know you will spend a lot of time searching for collecting data writing or using statistical analysis programs to process it and writing up your reports   5 go search analyst on and you 'll find myriad positions in everything from finance to marketing to supply chain etc which ask for degrees in business finance or other related field economics   in my opinion the prestige of the university from which you graduate is secondary to the work you do   assuming you do a research paper if it is kick ass it wo n't matter much if you went to harvard or not check your city county jobs site for internship opportunities since no matter what even getting an entry level job can be difficult if you 've never had any job experience in the field or related field   labor economics is big since there 's a lot of good data and it is a hot topic personally i 'm focusing on urban economics real estate planning and transportation the beauty of econ is that it is so broad you can almost do whatever you want but the drawback is that it is so broad it can be tough to show employers that you possess the specific skills and knowledge that make you desirable   hope this helps

you could achieve the same result with a balance transfer with many institutions some institutions allow bank accounts to be used as the balance transfer destination instead of another credit card balance transfers typically have much lower fees than cash advances and also are typically more readily available during 0 interest promotional periods after you receive cash in your checking account it is just as fungible and liquid as any other source of cash making the answer yes one caveat being that your credit utilization will also spike which has the effect of lowering your credit eligibility for the mortgage but there is a delay of a month or two before that is reported to the credit bureaus so the time delay mitigates that particular concern

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

you can fairly simply make a spreadsheet in your favorite spreadsheet application or in google docs if you want portability i like to make an overview page that shows how much i take in per month and what fixed bills come out of that then break the remaining total into four to get a weekly budget then i make one page per month with four columns one per week with each row being a category sum the categories at the bottom and subtract from your weekly total voila a quick reference of how much you can spend that week without going over budget i then make a page for each month that lists what i bought and how much i spent on it so i can trace where my money 's gone the category total is just a summation of the items from that page that belong in that category   once you have a system stop checking your bank balance except to ensure your paycheck is going in alright use the spreadsheet to determine how much you can spend at any time then make sure you pay off everything on the card before the end of the month so you do n't incur interest

so my read on the question is how do i invest 300k such that it earns me a living wage without the ongoing grind inherent in most formal employment   reading the other answers to date it looks like most of them are thinking in terms of investment accounts and trying to live off of the earnings from such   i wanted to throw out a couple of alternative choices that may be worth considering the first is real estate investing   $ 300k should allow you to pick up 2 or 3 single family with little or no mortgage   turning them into rentals placed with a good property management company should easily pay their expenses and provide a consistent income with minimal effort attention from you   similar story with buying into multifamily housing or commercial real estate your key concern here is picking the right market in which to buy and finding a reputable manager to handle the day to day issues on your behalf note that you are not overly concerned with the potential resale value of the but the probable rental income they can generate these are separate concerns that may not align with each other second is buying founding a business that has a general manager other than yourself   franchise ownership may be a potential option for you under the circumstances   the key concern here is picking the business location and manager that make you comfortable in terms of the risk involved   you need the place to make enough money to pay for itself and the salary of everyone working there with enough left over for you to live on   sounds easy enough but not so much in practice   generally you can expect at least a few years of being hands on and watching things very closely to make sure it is going the way you want it to   finding a mentor who has done this type of transition before to walk you through it would be strongly advised   so would preparing yourself for a failure or two before you work out the exact combination of factors that work for you

the short answer is yes you can but you have to make sure you do it correctly   if you are employed by a tech company that does contract work at a separate location and you do n't get reimbursed by your employer for travel expenses you can claim the mileage between your home and location b as a business expense but there 's a catch you have to subtract the mileage between your home and location a your employer so if it 's 20 miles from your house to your employer location a and 30 miles from your house to the business you 're contracting at location b you can only claim 10 miles each way so 20 miles total obviously if the distance to location b is closer than your employer location a you 're out of luck you will have to itemize to take this deduction by filling out a schedule a for itemized deductions and form to calculate how much of a deduction for travel expenses you can take google should i itemize if you 're unsure whether to take the standard deduction or itemize sources

i think you should really start a limited company for this it 'll be a lot simpler to spread the income over multiple years if your business and you have completely separate identities you should also consult an accountant if only once to understand the basics of how to approach this having a limited company would also mean that if it has financial problems you do n't end up having to pay the debts yourself with a separate company you would keep any money raised within the company initially and only pay it to yourself as salary over the three years so from an income tax point of view you 'd only be taxed on it as you received it the company would also pay for project expenses directly and there would n't be any income tax to pay on them at all you would have to pay other taxes like vat but you could choose to register for vat and then you 'd be able to reclaim vat on the company 's expenses but would have to charge vat to your customers if you start making enough money currently £ you have to register for vat whether you want to or not the only slight complication might be that you could be subject to corporation tax on the surplus money in the first year because it might seem like a profit however given that you would presumably have promised something to the over a three year period it should be possible to record your promises as a liability for unearned income in the company accounts in effect you 'd be saying although there 's still £ 60,000 in the bank i have promised to spend it on the thing so it 's not profit again you should consult an accountant at least over the basics of this

in the uk you have an allowance of £ 40,000 per annum for tax relief into a pension this amount includes both your and your employer 's contributions if you earn more than £ 150,000 per annum this allowance starts to reduce and if you earn less than the allowance your allowance is limited to what you earn you can also carry over unused allowance from up to 3 years previously if you stick within this allowance you wo n't pay tax on your pension contributions if you go over the excess will be subject to tax salary exchange normally lets you avoid the national insurance value of your contribution being taxed if you paid your own money into your pension without going through salary exchange your contributions would have the 20 basic rate of tax credited to them and if you 're a higher rate taxpayer you could reclaim the difference between the basic rate of tax and the higher rate of tax you pay but the national insurance you 've paid on your own money would not be you ca n't get the money back you 've paid into your pension till you are are 58 given that you are 27 now the minimum age has risen from its historic 55 for your age group   that 's the pension trade off you forgo tax now in the expectation that once retired you will be paying tax at a lower rate because your income will be lower and you are much less likely to be subject to higher rate taxation in return for locking in your money till you 're older your pension income will be subject to tax when you eventually take it there are other options such as isas which have lower annual limits £ 20,000 currently and on which your contributions do not attract tax relief but which are not taxed as income when you eventually spend them isas and pensions are not mutually exclusive so if you have the money you can do both it 's up to you to determine what mix of savings will be appropriate to generate income for your eventual retirement if you are living in some other country when you retire your pension will be paid net of uk tax you might then be able to claim or pay any difference between that and your local tax rate depending on what agreement exists between the uk government and the other country 's government

gt;now introduce chance by randomly assigning each participant a luck score that score however can play only a tiny role in the ultimate outcome just 2 percent compared with 98 percent allotted to skill this minor role for chance is enough to tilt the contest   away from the top skilled people in a simulation   with 1,000 participants   the person with the top skill score prevailed only 22 percent of the time   the more competition there is the hardest it is for skill alone to win out with 100,000 participants the most skilled person wins just 6 percent of the time     from low income families have only a 1 percent chance of reaching the top 5 percent of the income distribution versus children of the rich who have about a 22 percent chance   children born to the middle quintile of parental family income $ to $ had about the same chance of ending up in a lower quintile than their parents percent as they did of moving to a higher quintile percent their chances of attaining the top five percentiles of the income distribution were just 1.8 percent   further children born into the bottom quintile of income have a 42 chance of remaining there and only a 6 chance of making it to the top quintile for those born    in the top quintile it 's exactly the opposite 42 percent remain in the top quintile as adults and only 6 percent fall down to the lowest income bracket    i 'd imagine folks like you do n't like to read so

there 's no formula for how much is the ideal amount to spend on entertainment and fun as joetaxpayer says it 's all about balance maybe relative costs are different in france than in the us where i live but here housing and the things that go with it electricity heat insurance maybe a few other miscellaneous items are usually a huge portion of a young person 's expenses if you do n't mind living with your parents and they do n't mind having you you can save a lot of money there are lots of things you can do for fun that do n't cost a lot of money if your idea of fun is collecting fancy cars and making round the world trips yes that can get expensive fast when i was in my 20s my entertainment mostly consisted of going to movies amusement parks and occasional concerts and playing computer games those are n't super expensive as long as you do n't do them every day and keeping my car running which saved money over buying a new car these days i 'm in a situation analogous to yours i 'm getting older and so i 'm trying to build up a retirement account so i can retire comfortably so i have to balance how much i put away for retirement with spending on fun things now i have certain targets and so i budget that i will put this amount away for retirement every month and my spending money is what i have left i think that 's better than spend whatever i want on fun and then put what 's left toward retirement the latter plan is probably a fast route to debt

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

this is most likely protecting square 's relationship with visa mastercard amex etc credit card companies typically charge their customers a much higher interest rate with no grace period on cash advances withdrawals made from an atm using a credit card if you use square to generate something that looks like a merchandise transaction but instead just hand over a wad of banknotes you 're forcing the credit card company to apply their cheaper purchases interest rate on the transaction plus award any applicable cashback etc square would absolutely profit off of this but since it would result in less revenue for the partner credit card companies that would quickly sour the relationship and could even result in them terminating their agreements with square altogether this is the kind of activity they are trying to prevent   1 bill yourself $ 5,000 for merchandise but instead give yourself cash   2 earn 1.5 cashback $ 75   3 use $ of the cash and a $ 75 statement credit to pay your credit card statement   4 pocket the difference   5 repeat note the fees involved probably negate any potential gain shown in this example but i 'm sure with enough creative thinking someone would figure out a way to game the system if it was n't expressly forbidden in the terms of service

is my math correct the math is correct however dividends do n't work this way the yield is post facto i.e. given the dividend that is declared every quarter once calculates the yield the dividends are not fixed or guaranteed these change from quarter to quarter or at times they are not given at all the yield is and the value is $ 114 per share assuming that the price remains exactly the same for an entire year and that i purchase only one share then this should be the math for calculating the yield 114 x = what the link is showing is that last dividend of mcd was for q3 that means total for a year will be 4 this means yield will be note this year there were only 3 dividend was on on and on it is unlikely that there will be one more dividend this year so for this year the correct post facto calculation would be + = and hence an yield of   also are there any fees deductions or would i receive the amount in full which should be $ 3.75 there are no fee deducted not sure about us tax treatment on dividends

if you know the amounts that were combined $ 5,000 and $ 7,500 in your example not the original loan amounts necessarily then you can calculate a payment schedule in excel google sheets online etc using that amount and the interest rate   you can then apply your payments $ 100 to that payment schedule making sure to either accrue interest if your $ 100 did n't cover the monthly payment or pay down extra principal if your $ 100 more than covered the payment    the outstanding principal is the amount left or remaining balance a program like gnucash or quicken makes doing the payment schedule and applying payments relatively easy to handle   spreadsheets will require you to have 36 lines 3 years x 12 months of payment and detail but that should n't be too much work to be fair to your mother make sure you include any partially accrued interest on the full balance when paying it off   or even better include a full month 's interest in the pay off amount

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

if i understand you correctly no you should n't be charged interest lets say you have a billing cycle of monthly which usually is n't true you charge $ xx per day ending up at $ 1000 at the end of january so february 1st your bill for your january billing cycle is $ 1000 due by feb 15th lets say on february 1st you continue to charge $ xx per day you go to pay your bill online on feb 14th to be safe and you 'll usually see on your credit card website something like you 'd hit pay my bill and you 'd usually see these options at the date your cycle was due feb 15th if you have n't paid your full latest statement lets say you paid $ 500 they will charge you interest on the entire balance for the period so interest on $ 1000 or lets say $ 50 the other $ 500 will roll over to the next month so your next month you 'd be somewhere near a $ bill

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

thanks for the great response   the example with calculus is perfect group a is some students who will never ever get it no matter how much you teach and train them   as you know group b is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them they probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives   group c most will be in the middle struggle and with efforts of the professor if the class is not more than 10 15 students and their own efforts they will eventually understand some will get c some will get b and few will get a.   which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus   gt the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach    true i was an professor while studying for my master 's in the end of the semester students had to evaluate their professors i got the 2nd best results after another part time professor and way above all tenured professors are you surprised by the way i was teaching introductory classes and i was working for the department i was teaching for as a research intern   as for professors who do n't know how to teach this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past i.e. it 's because of past traditions    in the past the role of the professor was not so much to teach in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school attend and dance around every student 's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind   the role of the professor in the past being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required was to plan and sequence what has to be taught in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class no concern is given for students who ca n't keep the pace also the role was to challenge the students test then and answer any question they may have this includes debates over any topic related to the class material   gt i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job   absolutely true or let 's put it this way the best school was is and will be a master and an apprentice which is somewhat still done in germany and is the only way medical students learn because no choice the life of others is in their hands    by the way masters have zero patience for who do n't show a promise masters also have little talent in teaching but masters have long term 1000 patience to show again and again correct again and again demand explain and challenge their   to the point the masters actually do n't do much work and instead just teach in their own special way

i personally do not buy any those so call forecasts look no further than the economic forecasts by those experts with phds over the last decade or so   truth is there are too many factors that affects the tuition fees that far down the road think inflation cost of living the method for which the education is being delivered anticipated salary for the teachers the ratio of schools and students your children 's ability to obtain scholarship money and etc put in what you can afford for resp i put in $ 2000 annually per child to take maximum advantage of the 20 government matching   and be prepare to augment that with additional fund in 18 years   i am prepared to take on significant loans if my children both decided and qualified for graduated studies in specialized fields in a prestige universities i have had met people with graduate degrees from harvard and cambridge and the obscure sum they or their parents paid on tuition are about as good investment as i have ever seen   education is one of the best gifts any parent could give to their child

gt;but facebook which claims more than 900 million members had 158 million unique visitors to its site in april according to researcher up just 5 from a year ago that compares with year over year growth rates of 89 in april 2010   so about 1 in 6 users visited facebook during a particular recent month   the other 5 of 6 of users did n't visit during that month   hmmm   sounds like a lot of relatively dead fairly inactive accounts users to   and the thing is that different than other social sites like linkedin which is in a lot of ways an online resume amp business contact database facebook pretty much needs continuous and regular use that 's the premise that their whole model especially advertising wise is built on if fb reverts to people simply using it to maintain a once or twice a year update on movements of friends i.e. it becomes the equivalent of a card list storage site then it 's potential value diminishes rather dramatically   gt;also the social network is testing ways to allow those under 13 currently prohibited to participate with parental supervision   which seems from a cynical perspective anyway to be a sign that they are potentially getting desperate to maintain the purported growth in number of users and in a certain sense they are doing what all companies with saturated markets do a futile attempt to pull future demand into the present which of course to the extent that it succeeds anyway really just moves the inevitable that much closer     edit and in addition not surprisingly it looks like principle which tends to be recursive of the roughly 20 unique visitors during the month probably the majority of them roughly 80 of the 16 engaged in minimal activity with only some 20 of it and thus somewhere round of the total user base being truly active and then again probably only 20 of that maybe at or under 1 were of the users that everyone thinks are

if you want to make money while european equities markets are crashing and the euro itself is devaluing none of these strategies are to be taken lightly all involve risk there are probably numerous ways that you can lose even though it seems like you should win transaction fees could eat your profits especially if you have only a small amount of capital to invest with the worst part is that they all involve timing if you think the crash is coming next week you could say buy a bunch of puts but if the crash does n't come for another 6 months all of your puts are going to expire worthless and you 've lost all of your capital even worse if you sell short an index etf this week in advance of next week 's impending crash and some rescue package arrives over the weekend equity prices could spike at the beginning of the week and you 'd be screwed

my simplest approach is to suggest that people go roth when in the 15 bracket and use pre tax to avoid 25 i outlined that strategy in my article the 15 solution   the monkey wrench that gets thrown in to this is the distortion of the other smooth marginal tax curve caused by the taxation of social security for those who can afford to it makes the case to lean toward roth as much as possible   i 'd suggest always depositing pretax and using conversions to better control the process two major benefits to this it 's less a question of too late than of what strategy to use

if you 're fiscally responsible go ahead and use a   honestly in all of the horror story experiences i 've seen where someone went into honest details they were trying to skate by with risky decisions at the extreme bottom end of the financial spectrum nearly all of the complaints boil down to overdraft fees for people who run their account down to less than $ 10 and then get upset when something unexpected happens   for example when banks re order purchases from largest to smallest so that users would have to pay a larger quantity of overdraft fees that can literally only happen if you 've tried to spend more than you have in the account it 's mathematically not possible for that to happen any other way so yes i think everyone can agree re ordering is shitty but those overdrafts are also 100 preventable by not trying to spend more than you   most people just want to jump on the gripe train and they are n't going to share the real details of their situation if they even understand them

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

re specifically am i right in that everything i put on these is deducted from tax or are there other rules and   am i correctly understanding this as anything above £ 3,600 per year will not be deducted from your tax neither interpretation seems quite right unless what you mean is this the contributions to a pension or to the share save scheme are deducted from your pay before it is taxed that 's how it works for employer run pension schemes in other words you are paying the gross amount you earn into the pension not the amount after tax it 's a tax efficient way to save because compared to other forms of saving the bit about the £ 3,600 you can ignore this assuming you 're earning more than £ 3,600 a year what happens to the pension if you decide to move back to france or another country in some cases you can transfer tax free worst case you 'd pay some tax on the transfer but not more than 25 see here for the current rules re the share scheme if by salary exchange you mean salary sacrifice where your gross pay is officially reduced by that amount e.g. £ 150 a month that 's even more tax efficient because it saves you paying the national insurance contribution too approx 9 of the pay packet conclusion saving into pension and company share save schemes is supremely tax efficient and provided you 're ok with your money being locked away until you 're 57 pension or tied up in company shares it 's understandably many people 's priority to make use of these schemes before considering other forms of saving where you pay into them from your salary after tax now about this i am trying to understand how much i should put into it should i put money into these or should look for another way to save how will this work out if i go back to france or another country nobody here can advise you what to do since individuals goals and circumstances are different and we do n't know enough of the picture that said fwiw i 'll tell you what i might do based solely on what you 've told us in the question first i 'd definitely contribute 6 to the company pension this gets you the full employer match that 's free money plus remember the tax relief = more free money if you 're 27 a total of 12 salary into a pension a year is a decent rate to start saving for retirement actually 14 would be generally advisable and maybe more still it 's generally a case of the more the better especially while young as you have time for growth and you do n't know what later priorities might change financial needs might arise nevertheless you said you might move overseas so in your position i would then

closing a credit card decreases your total available balance which can have a small negative effect if that credit card is a significant portion of your available credit   if it is not then it likely will have little impact on your credit in that department however the case you explained get a card use it for a short while then dump it wo n't have much long term impact to your available credit since you will end up with the same amount as you started the second factor will be the average age of accounts   this will affect you both in the short and long term if you 've had accounts open for a fairly long time but wo n't impact you much if your credit history is fairly short   even closed accounts affect the average age of accounts for fico scores but not for some other scoring methods such as vantagescore   if you have only one other account and it was 10 years old then opening and closing this decreases your average age of accounts from 10 to 5 years a significant hit which will not go away for years 10 + years in some cases though usually 7 years   this will lower your score some   if you have had a lot of accounts though including things like mortgage student loan etc this wo n't have as significant of an impact and if you had a short history in the first place it wo n't hurt you much either the third factor will be the hard credit pull   that will have a small negative impact for around six months so do n't do this just before getting a mortgage but mostly this wo n't be a significant for you

i found the following on a stock to mutual conversion for insurance firms for ohio pulling from that link   any domestic stock life insurance corporation incorporated under a general law may become a mutual life insurance corporation and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock provided such plan a has been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such corporation b has been approved by a vote of stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock then outstanding at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose c has been approved by a majority of the policyholders voting at a meeting of policyholders called for the purpose each of whom is insured in a sum of at least one thousand dollars and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least one year prior to such meeting   and any stockholder who has to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the stockholders and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled may be ordered to do so by a decree of the court of common for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose and such decree may provide that upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation   since they successfully became a mutual insurance company i would guess that those stocks were acquired back by the company and are leftover from the conversion they would not represent an ownership in the company but might have value to a collector

the short answer is the money is yours from the insurance company they actually ca n't tell you how to spend it they can only decide from their tables and your plan how much you get the longer answer usually the insurance company pays one blanket amount then the rest where you have to submit receipts   you 're also lucky because damage over time is rarely covered damage is usually only covered as sudden damage so they do n't pay out for maintenance issues you can repair your house the way you want i even do some of my own labor because some repair jobs just do n't get covered what they really cost to do right    however your mortgage company can withhold part of your claim to verify satisfactory work this is to maintain the value of the collateral and the insurance company can choose not to cover pre existing damage   generally they do n't stray from the assessment    i do not know of any law that permits an internal inspection of your home without your consent   they can come look at the outside but they ca n't force you to let them inspect inside unless they 're holding some of your insurance payment hostage for most banks receipts are sufficient a good contractor usually will meet all the needs with an itemized budget and has a bit of wiggle room to fix things the right way while keeping the bank and mortgage company happy

you 're lending the money to your business by paying for it directly   the company accounts must reflect a credit the amount you lend to it and a debit what it then puts that loan towards    it 's fairly normal for a owner driven company to reflect a large loan account for the owners   for example if you have a room at home dedicated for the business it is impractical to pay rent directly via the company   the rental agreement is probably in your name you pay the rent and you reconcile it with the company later you could even charge your company taxable interest on this loan when you draw down the loan from the company you reverse this debit your loan account and credit the company paying off the debt as far as tracking that expenditure simply handle those third party invoices in the normal way and file them for reference

long term capital gains which is often the main element of investment income for investors who are not high frequency day traders are taxed at a single rate that is often substantially below the marginal rate they would otherwise be taxed at particularly for wealthy individuals there are a few behind this treatment the two most common are that the government wants to encourage long term investments as opposed to short term speculation and that capital gains are a kind of double taxation from one point of view as they are coming from income that has already been taxed once before as wage or ordinary income   the latter in particular is highly controversial but this is one of the more divisive political issues in the taxation front one party would eliminate the tax entirely the other would eliminate the difference for most individuals the majority of their long term capital gains are taxed at 15 up to almost half of a million dollars total agi which is a fairly low rate it 's equivalent to the rate a taxpayer would pay on up to $ 37,000 in wage income after deductions exemptions etc   you can see from this table in wikipedia that it is much preferred to pay long term capital gains rates when possible at every point it 's at least 10 lower than the tax rate for ordinary income ordinary income includes wages and many other sources of income basically anything that is not long term capital gains wage income is taxed at this rate and also subject to some non income tax taxes fica and medicare in particular other sources of ordinary income are not subject to those taxes including ira income   short term capital gains are generally included in this bucket qualified dividends are treated similarly to long term capital gains as they are of a similar nature and taxed accordingly the net investment tax is basically applying the medicare tax to investment income for higher income taxpayers $ 125k single $ 250k joint   it 's on top of capital gains rates for them   it came about through the affordable care act and is one of the first provisions likely to be repealed by the new congress as it can be repealed through the budgeting provision   it seems likely that 2017 taxes will not contain this provision

is it difficult to ask the credit card issuer for two cards even if the account belongs to one person you can most definitely get two cards for one account people do it all the time you just have to add her on as an authorized user   would it be better for me to apply for the card on my own or would there be an advantage to having her co sign it depends if she co signed then that means she is also responsible for the credit card payments which can help her credit score if its is just you applying then you are the only one responsible if you do n't want her lower credit score to impact what you could be approved for then only you should apply however if you are the sole account holder then you are responsible for the payments which means if in the event you guys break up and she maxes out the card before you cancel it then you are on the hook for what she spend   as for improving her credit score i do know that some banks report to the credit bureaus for the authorized user as well so that could help her out too

i like the other answers   but here 's one thing that concerns me that has n't specifically been addressed yet you mentioned your student loans are at low rates of interest   are those rates fixed or variable   if those interest rates are variable i would not count on rates remaining low indefinitely   if you could imagine those rates going up by say 2 or 4 or more over time would such rates make you change your mind about the debt and the pace at which you 're paying it off i would suggest that as the economy recovers over the next couple of years the of inflation will force the fed to raise interest rates   you do n't want to be holding variable rate debt when rates are rising   for that reason if your loan rate is variable i would increase your payment amount so you can eliminate your debt sooner than later also you mention in one of your comments that buying a home is 4 + years away   that 's not a long time so i would n't commit the bulk of your savings to investing in the stock market which can be over short periods of time   you do n't want to be in a large loss position just when it 's time to buy your first home however it may be worth having some of your skin in the game so to speak   personally i would take a balanced approach 1/3 debt repayment 1/3 high interest cash savings and 1/3 in some broad diversified index funds and not all in the u.s.   although i also like the idea of getting some travel in while young so perhaps 1/4 allocations to the money stuff and 1/4 towards travel   good luck

the interesting thing about an fsa is that you have access to your total annual election immediately   after electing to put $ 200 per month toward your fsa you can go have a $ 1,500 surgery on january 3rd and pay with your fsa funds   then you can leave the company on february 1st and not owe the company anything i understand that you do n't like that this is the answer but it is   the employer is on the hook for the full elected liability of an fsa plan as of the first day of the plan year   the employer is also paying admin costs that are n't passed to the employees   you contest that this arrangement could leave current employees picking up the bag for employees but there is no employee liability   fsa plans run at a net cost the the employer i 'm sure there are outlier exceptions however i disagree with your premise that   employees generally dislike that fsa plans are use it or lose it and also that there appears to be an obvious alternative that would be preferable the employees that dislike the rules of fsa accounts do n't fully understand the nuances and surely assume that fsa is a synonym for hsa   tons of employers offer their employees fsa plans and they are very well received   you can fill full prescriptions off of a debit card on the third day of the year before you 've even contributed anything hsas are great i have one but they require enrollment in a hdhp and you can only spend the funds currently available in your account   these are two huge limitations addressed by fsa plans   you can have a $ 0 deductible platinum plan with a $ 2,000 out of pocket max and an fsa debit card for virtually tax free healthcare   the caveat being if you do n't use your full fsa election you give it up in fact my biggest gripe with the fsa hsa discussion is that anyone feels the need to claim that hsa funds do n't expire at the end of a plan year as though it 's something other than a personal savings account   an fsa is a spending account or arrangement which is an entirely different animal   it would be like claiming that ira funds do n't expire as though they might somehow

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

you need a good erp or at least ii implementation which means you need someone very familiar with or someone who becomes very familiar with your business to get it done right   those do n't come setup for some unique business as an off the shelf thing and while many are customizable you can easily end up in customization hell both dollar wise operation interruption wise and technical wiki   but this really begs for someone to ask why are you not maintaining amp updating your existing custom software   why attempt to ditch something that is hopefully working fairly well for the highly risky prospect of some entirely new untested system     is the business logic and the operation of the old system working well   while it might seem to be costly in terms of time amp money your best bet in my experience would be to get a really good programmer possibly with a cheap assistant temp helper to do some grunt work for him to document maintain and then slowly upgrade your current already in place software and/or rewrite it to use modern db 's web interfaces etc    because changing out your system is like replacing all the and in your body it will not be a pleasant experience and the patient may not survive the operation even if the implementation is a labeled a success the business is littered with the of erp victims   the big dogs have three huge upfront cost areas 1 the consultants in various teams stages 2 the underlying database software costs initial licenses 3 the ongoing licenses 4 the ongoing customization fixes if you ever want to upgrade alas most of the consultants who do customizations do n't do document it in a way that facilitates easy upgrades in part because that would significantly reduce their income

rebalancing has been studied empirically quite a bit but not particularly carefully and actually turns out to be very hard to study well   the main problem is that you do n't know until afterward if your target weights were optimal so a bad rebalancing program might give better performance if it closer to optimal weights even if it did n't do an efficient job of keeping near the target weights in your particular case either method might be preferred depending on a number of things you can see why there is n't a generally correct answer to your question and the results of empirical studies might very wildly depending on the mix of assets and risk tolerance   still if your portfolio is not too complicated you can estimate the costs of the two methods without too much trouble and figure out if it is worthwhile to you edit in response to comment below your example gets at what makes rebalancing so hard empirically but also generally pretty easy in practice   if you were to target 75 equity 25 bonds and look at returns only for 30 years the best rebalancing method would be to never rebalance and just let 75 equity go to near 100 as equity has better long term returns   this happens when you look only at returns as the final number and do n't take into account the change in risk in your portfolio in practice most people that are still adding or subtracting in retirement to a retirement portfolio are adding removing a significant amount compared to the total amount in their portfolio   in the case you it is cheaper massively cheaper in the presence of load fees just to use new capital to trade toward your target keeping your risk profile   new money should be large enough to keep you near enough your target   if you just estimate the trading costs fees in both cases i think you 'll see just how large the difference is between the two methods this will dwarf any small differences in return over the long run even if you ca n't trade back all the way to your target

i agree that retail looks for orderly markets but orderly markets have really never existed really study market history and you 'll see that markets are more orderly today than they ever have been the stuff that used to take place was just insane and happened before computers let alone hft   let me state that while it may seem like i 'm defending hft my algos are actually much longer term and would n't be hurt by any of your proposals i think many of the hft guys are no better than those three card monte sharks who used to fill times square but they 're just playing the game they 're not good but they 're also not bad they 're just another segment of players in orderly markets up and down they really do add liquidity when things go awry as they tend to do in the markets the hfts step aside but do n't fool yourself market makers have always done the exact same thing and also remember that many markets do n't even have market makers traders provide all liquidity   here 's the thing retail investors to the markets when everything is going up and up they believe they can do no wrong and that prices will go up forever then the market gets a bit tougher retail investors and most pros by the way start to lose and then retail investors cry foul markets were never intended to be a nice safe playground for the masses they were designed for those who dedicate their lives to understanding them i do n't pretend that i can litigate a legal case operate on someone 's brain or build a bridge experts have studied those areas for decades and are quite good at those things but retail investors have always thought of wall street as some sort of safe las vegas in reality it 's survival of the   i 'll say to you what i say to every one of my friend 's who wants me to show them a few things about trading if you are n't going to really commit thousands of hours to understanding the markets then stay out invest money that you do n't need for some time in a few good mutual funds keep your debt to a minimum do n't chase quick profits if you do n't understand the game

you do realize that the fund will have management expenses that are likely already factored into the nav and that when you sell the nav will not yet be known right there are often fees to run a mutual fund that may be taken as part of managing the fund that are already factored into the net asset of the shares that would be my caution as well as possible fee changes as dilip sarwate notes in a comment expense ratios are standard for mutual funds yes individual stocks that represent corporations not structured as a mutual fund do n't declare a ratio of how much are their costs e.g. apple or google may well invest in numerous other companies but the costs of making those investments wo n't be well detailed though these companies do have non investment operations of course do n't forget to read the fund 's prospectus as sometimes a fund will have other fees like account maintenance fees that may be taken out of distributions as well as being aware of how taxes will be handled as you do n't specify what kind of account these purchases are being done using

it seems from the bernanke and pundits in general that there 's an ideal inflation rate and it 's not zero when you reference that recessions bring prices down i think i understand you but recession does not mean deflation in fact deflation is a rarity not a common occurrence   when you look at what compounding does you see that a 3 inflation rate will double the cost of an item in 24 years from 1975 to 2010 inflation was 4x as it ran well above 3 for a time i chose that date as i was 13 at the time and was n't too aware of specific prices before that so i 've seen a pizza go from $ 3 to $ 12 during my life i hope to live long enough to see it double again   i think that it 's hyperinflation that 's an ongoing concern but the controlled inflation as i just described is not detrimental in fact it 's preferable in some sense for example when i look at my 5 mortgage it 's 3.6 after tax but with a 3 inflation rate my cost is really .6 as the remaining debt devalues over time and the house in theory goes up with inflation on the other extreme higher inflation say 8 starts to be detrimental distorting spending behavior and bad for the system

the biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation which is called risk the scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict price portfolio doubles and you need to consider risk one way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is sharpe ratio risk adjusted return or the related ratio one piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk but that is not telling the whole story when you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk you are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax $ 1000 an alternative to a single stock is to invest in an etf much lower risk which you can buy and hold for a long time and the price growth of an etf ex spy can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth fluctuation look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to spy for example ibm compare the beta of ibm and tsla and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like tesla over ibm what is the beta of your stock and how willing are you to accept that risk when you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk although you may reduce your absolute return this can not be done with a single stock but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant keep the grant shares and still effectively manage risk some years ago i had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants options in a company where i worked during the time i worked there their price varied between $ 30/share and < $ 1/share i was able to liquidate at $

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

take a look at google checkout but keep in mind that there is a different list of countries that they support as sellers vs. buyers the buyer list is much more comprehensive and i believe covers cis russia ukraine and belarus while the seller list does not yet which means that your client will need to create a u.s. or u.k. based entity to accept payments however they will be able to accept payments from buyers both in cis and internationally

# 451688
the idea here is to get an idea of how to value each business and thus normalize how highly prized is each dollar that a company makes   while some companies may make millions and others make billions how does one put these in proper context   one way is to consider a dollar in earnings for the company   how does a dollar in earnings for google compare to a dollar for coca cola for example   some companies may be valued much higher than others and this is a way to see that as share price alone can be rather misleading since some companies can have millions of shares outstanding and split the shares to keep the share price in a certain range thus the idea is n't that an investor is paying for a dollar of earnings but rather how is that perceived as some companies may not have earnings and yet still be traded as start ups and other companies may be running at a loss and thus the p e is n't even meaningful in this case assuming everything but the p e is the same the lower p e would represent a greater value in a sense yes   however earnings growth rate can account for higher p es for some companies as if a company is expected to grow at 40 for a few years it may have a higher p e than a company growing earnings at 5 for example

it can take a while for inflation to into all aspects an economy and be felt by a consumer often things that consumers use the most like gasoline wheat products corn products soy products and sugar are commodities spread across global markets with their own pricing which may be impacted by inflation in any given country   also inflation can be beneficial in some ways a $ 500/month mortgage payment was a big deal 30 years ago and now would be considered trivial that 's entirely because of inflation   run away inflation where people are burning the currency to stay warm is a different beast altogether be wary of people who conflate inflation consumer pricing and destructive currency devaluation because they 're not the same things

a currency that is strong right now is one that is expensive for you to buy the perfect one would be a currency that is weak now but will get stronger the worst currency is one that is strong today and gets weak if a currency stays unchanged it does n't matter whether it is weak or strong today as long as it does n't get weaker stronger while this advice is correct it is useless for investing since you do n't know which currencies will get weaker stronger in the future   investing in your own currency means less risk your local prices are usually not affected by currency change if you safe for retirement and want to retire in a foreign country you might consider in that country 's currency

long answer interest rates and fiscal   answer the issuer of the currency is n't revenue constrained in its own currency so the debt situation is n't bad at all it 's just a record of net issuance on interest payments two considerations first is that when the interest rate is less than the growth rate debt gdp levels off second is that the interest rate is a price set by the issuer so interest payments are n't a problem either   does that mean the government can just spend without limit or consequence no a thousand times no what it does mean though is that those limits and consequences are properly described in terms of what the economy needs and not in terms of budget constraints or to put it another way they 're balancing an economy not a budget

the point here is actually about banks or is in reference to banks they expect you know how a savings account at a bank works but not mutual funds and so are trying to an erroneous notion that you might have that the will insure your investment in the fund   banks work by taking in deposits and lending that money out via mortgages the mortgages can last up to 30 years but the deposits are on demand which means you can pull your money out at any time   see the problem they 're maintaining a fiction that that money is there safe and sound in the bank vault ready to be returned whenever you want it when in fact it 's been loaned out and ca n't be called back quickly either they know only a little bit of that money will be demanded by depositors at any given time so they keep a percentage called a reserve to satisfy that er demand   the rest again is loaned out gone   and usually that works out just fine except sometimes it does n't when people get scared they might not get their money back and they all go to the bank at the same time to demand their on demand deposits back this is called a run on the bank and when that happens the bank fails 'cause it ai n't got the money   what 's failing in fact is the fiction that your money is there whenever you want it and that 's really bad because when that happens to you at your bank your friends the customers of other banks start worrying about their money and run on their banks which fail which cause more people to worry and try to get their cash out lather rinse repeat until the whole economy crashes see the great depression   so various governments introduced deposit insurance where the government will step in with the cash so when you panic and pull all your money out of the bank you can go home happy cash in hand and do n't freak all your friends out therefore the fear that your money might not really be there is and it does n't spread like a mental everyone can comfortably go back to believing the fiction and the economy goes back to chugging along   meanwhile with mutual funds etfs everyone understands the money you put in them is invested and not sitting in a gigantic vault and so there 's no need for government insurance to maintain the fiction   and that 's the point they 're trying to make   poorly i might add where their wording is concerned

in the case of regulated exchange traded options the writer of an options contract is obliged to maintain a margin with their broker and the broker is obliged to maintain a margin with the clearing house   institutional writers of options will deal directly with the clearing house in the event that the writer is unable to make a daily margin call the broker or clearing house may automatically close out all of their positions using existing margin held   if there was a shortfall the broker or clearing house would be left to the client writer to make good on their obligations none of this effects the position of the original buyer of the options contract   effectively the buyer 's counterparty is their broker 's clearing house account

my opinion is that 50 savings is the number to shoot for and i strive toward that number as often as possible   10 savings for retirement 10 savings for short term emergency fund 25 payment on mortgage principal 5 savings for planned big purchases i overpay the principal so that 25 of my income goes to principal payments and i separately account for the mortgage interest home owners insurance as another expense in my budget   because of this aggressive payment schedule the house i bought 2 years ago will be payed in full in another 9 years   i own another property outright that i paid down in the same fashion and i collect rent on it as a supplement to my income   i started with a small townhouse that i could easily afford but now i have a much larger home that i can still easily afford the emergency fund does n't need to be more than 6 months of expenses which is 3 months of income if your expenses are only 50 of your income   i keep 6 months of expenses liquid and another 12 in a low risk investment   once you have your emergency fund funded you can add that percentage to a different category say 15 to retirement and 10 to planned big purchases or you can over fund it   i have had a few catastrophes that have depleted that fund so i like having the extra 12 months of income available i set the last 5 aside for wants that are not regular expenses   if i want a car i save 5 of my income until i can pay cash for it   i have an infinite number of these wants so i prioritize them and buy them in order when the cash becomes available the reason i use percentages is to keep me focused when my income increases instead of spending all the additional money that i could afford to spend each time i get a raise i instead only increase my expenses to the 50 mark   it was much harder to save 50 when i got my first job out of college but now i live quite comfortably on that percentage and i could take a large hit to my income before i would need to make significant changes to my lifestyle

the best answer i can give is be prepared for change there 's no perfect question you can ask or assurance you can get prior to accepting the offer that will give you any particularly perfect security or sense of stability here   the company itself is going through a change of identity that can change how it will do business and even what the business is and how revenue is acquired   in the time of the acquisition your role within the company could change radically for better or worse it could even be eliminated entirely if that type of uncertainty does n't appeal to you do n't take the position if you are absolutely about this job the best thing you can do is to learn more about the business itself and see if you can make any educated bets about how your role will play into the changes in business strategy that will come with the acquisition

the thing about the us and oil is that we both produce and consume a lot of it yes the oil producing parts of the us economy benefit from a higher oil price and are hurt by a lower oil price but the oil consuming sectors of the us economy benefit from a low oil price so it 's hard to say definitively whether lower oil prices hurt or help the us as a whole although i personally suspect that low oil prices benefit the usa economy more than they hurt it

freezing your credit should be the default configuration     edit   more info on why   basically you 're adding a password to your credit report access     4 is there a low cost alternative to monitoring services   the best low cost alternative to credit monitoring services is a security freeze a security freeze locks your credit files at the three credit reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion until you unlock your file with a password or pin the freeze stops new accounts from being established by because potential creditors are not able to check your credit report or credit score the standard procedure when financial accounts are opened any potential requests for access to your credit files will be denied   however a security freeze can not stop misuse of your existing bank or credit accounts you still must check the monthly statements on your current accounts for any erroneous charges or debits   generally you will pay no more than $ 30 for a lifetime of security freeze protection in some circumstances identity theft victims and senior citizens in some states this protection may be free   with a security freeze your credit reports can not be seen by prospective creditors insurance companies landlords utilities or for employment screening however you may lift the freeze when necessary to allow a company to check your credit report this is easily done by means of a password it is important to realize that a security freeze does not prevent existing creditors from seeing your credit report    while a security freeze may be the best available deterrent to new account fraud it may not be the best solution for everyone it can be cumbersome for individuals who frequently apply for credit are contemplating a new mortgage or who plan to change jobs on the other hand a security freeze is particularly well suited for seniors who are no longer in the market for new credit and a freeze provides protection for individuals affected by data breaches involving social security numbers as well as victims of identity theft or mail theft for a more complete discussion of the pros and cons of security freezes read this report in consumer reports   brian post how i learned to stop worrying and embrace the security freeze is a primer on what you can do to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft   fees supporting documentation and procedures for placing a security freeze vary from state to state and among the three credit reporting agencies the web sites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze the websites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze   equifax experian transunion

tl;dr summary 0 balance transfer offers and free checks usable anywhere    rarely are a good deal for the customer 0 rate balance transfer offers and the checks usable anywhere including payment of taxes come with a transaction fee because the credit card company is paying off the balance on the other card or the tax or the electric bill in the full amount of $ x as stated on the other card statement or on the tax electric bill this is in contrast to a purchase transaction where if you buy something for $ x you pay the card company $ x but the card company pays the merchant something less than $ of course the merchant has jacked up the sale price of the item to pass on the charge to you can you get the credit card company to waive the transaction fee you can try asking them but it is unlikely that you will succeed if your credit score is good i have seen balance transfer offers with no transaction fees made to people who have do n't have good credit scores and are used to carrying a balance   on their credit cards i assume that the company making the offer knows that it will make up the transaction fee from future interest payments a few other points to keep in mind with respect to using a 0 balance transfer offer to pay off a student loan or anything else for that matter

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

as one answer points out people buying cards care little about whether they cost 25 cents or $ 5   those are both small amounts of money and it 's not something you buy often also people feel the need to spend money because it 's a gift on the supplier side it should be noted that the cost of cards has little to do with the paper they are printed on   there is an expectation that cards are new and unique something the buyer and recipient have never seen   so they have writers and graphic designers constantly out a large variety of cards and replacing existing cards with new ones of which only a small number get sold before they move to the next model   relatively speaking there is a lot of human effort per thousand cards sold   then of course there is the real estate they occupy in the store disproportionate to a bunch of pieces of paper and other retail marketing and distribution costs   i 'm not saying margins are particularly thin but if they were crazy high we probably would see more entry as you suggest

first let 's look at the tax brackets for single taxpayers in 2016 the cutoff between the 25 and 28 tax bracket is $   you said that your gross is $   this will be reduced by deductions and exemptions at least $ 10,350   your rental income will increase your income but it is offset in part by your rental business expenses for this year you will almost certainly be in the 25 bracket whether or not you receive your this year   next year if you receive your then and your salary is $ 11k higher i 'm guessing you 'll be close to the edge it is important to remember that the tax brackets are marginal   this means that when you move up to the next tax bracket it is only the amount of income that puts you over the top that is taxed at the higher rate   you can see this in the chart above   so if for example your taxable income ends up being $ you 'll be in the 28 tax bracket but only $ 10 of your income will be taxed at 28   the rest will be taxed at 25 or lower   as a result this probably is n't worth worrying about too much a bit more explanation requested by the op here is how to understand the numbers in the tax bracket chart   let 's take a look at the second line $   the tax rate is explained as $ plus 15 of the amount over $ 9,275   the first $ 9,275 of your taxable income is taxed at a 10 rate   so if your total taxable income falls between $ and $ 37,650 the first $ 9,275 is taxed at 10 a tax of $ and the amount over $ 9,275 is taxed at 15   on each line of the chart the amount of tax from all the previous brackets is carried down so you do n't have to calculate it when i said that you have at least $ 10,350 in deductions and exemptions i got that number from the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount   for 2016 the standard deduction for single taxpayers is $ 6,300   if you itemize your deductions you might be able to deduct more   personal exemptions for 2016 are at $ 4,050 per person   that means you get to reduce your taxable income by $ 4,050 for each person in your household   since you are single with no dependents your standard deduction plus the personal exemption for yourself will result in a reduction of at least $ 10,350 on your taxable income

the exchange rate between two currencies is simply the price that the most recent market participants were able to agree on when trading ie if the is 1.36 it 's because the last trade that happened where someone bought 1 usd cost 1.36 cad there is no one person organization which decides the rate between two currencies the rate moves you see is just the reality of money changing hands as people in various situations trade currencies for various reasons just like with stocks or any other market product foreign exchange rates can fluctuate wildly based on many things it is very difficult to forecast where rates will go because the biggest changes in rates can often be unpredictable news events for example when brexit happened the value of the gbp plummeted relative to other currencies because the market traders had less faith in the uk economy and therefore were n't willing to pay as much to buy gbp see more here there is a very high level of risk in the foreign exchange market for your sake do n't get involved in any trading that you do not well understand first

not only does the interest get charged from day 1 on new purchases as long as you have a revolving balance but the credit card agreement often says something to the effect that any partial payment is applied first to the   interest to date and then transfer balances on which no interest is being charged and so the bank is losing money on it then to other transfer   balances and cash advances and no refund of that 3 fee that was   collected up front on the cash advance and finally to the purchases starting from the most recent back to the oldest one even the faq on my card site says in simple language   we apply payments and credits at our discretion including in a manner most favorable or convenient for us see mhoran_psprep 's answer the moral is indeed what dheer has already told you do not carry a revolving balance on a credit card and if you have a revolving balance pay it off as soon as possible   do not wait for the end of the grace period if possible pay it off the day the statement is   issued or if you can make only a partial payment make it as soon as possible   make multiple partial payments each month if you have cash flow problems or improve your cash flow by forgoing one or more of the many lattes you consume each day   credit card debt is close to the worst kind of debt that you can have and it is best to get out from under as soon as possible remember there is effectively no grace period as long as you have a revolving balance on your credit card   you are paying interest for every one of those days

not doing this would defeat the entire purpose of a vat the reason for a vat rather than a simple sales tax is that it 's harder to evade having a simple sales tax with the type of rates that vat taxes typically are is because evasion is too easy imagine i 'm a retailer i buy products from a wholesaler and sell them to consumers with a sales tax if i do n't charge the customer sales tax the customer is happy and i do n't care assuming i do n't get caught and if i keep the sales tax but do n't report the sale i make a lot of money now imagine a vat if i do n't charge the customer the vat i lose money since i paid the vat on the wholesale products and if i do n't report the sale how do i claim my vat refund

you need to distinguish a company 's guidance from analysts estimates a company will give a revenue earnings guidance which is generally based on internal budgets the guidance   may be aggressive or conservative some are known to be conservative and the market will take that into account to form actual estimates when you see a headline saying that a company missed it is generally by reference to the analysts estimates analysts use a company 's guidance as one data point among many others to form a forecast of revenue earnings the idea behind those headlines is that the average sales earnings estimates of analysts is a good approximation of what the market expects which is debatable

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

gt;&gt i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   gt not gon na happen   totally agree with you what i was proposing is what should be done   gt waiting for disadvantaged kids to get higher scores will not happen until they get accepted into college   even then almost all disadvantaged kids smart or not smart the diploma they get is almost worthless the diploma will not give them much advantage or improve their situation the diploma barely even helps very smart kids from rich advantaged homes   actually if in the past no matter who you knew no matter your family background a diploma will almost always guarantee a secure and advantaged life   gt if you force schools to gain their income from future students earnings they will have high concern for kids that have a good p e ratio it will also stop the loan industry from putting these kids into debt   in theory you are correct in practice many many problems to implement for starters this makes college a very risky business because it 's very hard to predict future income of its students even the very smart and accomplished students and i will give you a related example colleges teach computer science programming to many kids today but the profession is about to die due ai and automation + outsourcing this was unexpected 1 2 years ago    barely economists can predict the economy so you want colleges to predict income based on what is taught   gt the downside is that it may turn colleges into trade techs    actually colleges are already trade techs because today almost all students study just for the hope to get a job   in the past you studied to become a scholar and wise and then pick some kind of a job of your interest where being generally smart and knowledgeable is needed   bottom line since you and i know that nothing will be done no higher standards and no future income based tuition here 's what what 's happening with my son which is what happened with me which is still happening in germany no i am not german but i come from a german culture my parents are of german descent but i was born and raised in israel   it 's called master and apprentice   i have been working since i was 13 with computers and if you consider my age 55 when i was 13 no pcs with internet and only punch cards were used to access a computer my parents did not push me it was me who felt the need to work while i was studying just like my father had that need when he was young   my son 13 today but since he was 10 the apple does not fall far from the tree found work he 's not even allowed to work by law and is making money he 's right now teaching administering and designing minecraft worlds and applications   hands on experience especially taught from a master is better than any diploma   he will probably go to some so so college to get a piece of paper called diploma while he will continue working in whatever he 's interested   he will be successful like i am not trying to brag i never pushed him but i explained to you some realities of the world   last word actually most masters real masters are desperate to teach for free their knowledge vision and know and the system does not allow them to do that to protect the colleges and universities only in medicine it 's still happens think about it

sure thing   treasuries bonds bills are what the us gov uses to borrow however it 's slightly different than taking out a loan it 's basically an agreement to give repay a set sum of money at a certain time in the future in exchange for a sum of funding that 's determined by market forces supply amp demand the difference between today 's price and the payment in the future is the interest    for example completely made up numbers   today is the government issues a bond that say it will pay who ever owns this bond $ 105 on the market decides that $ 105 from the us government paid a year from now is worth $ 100 today    in other words the us government is borrowing for one year at a rate of 5        105 100 100 = .05 = 5   now consider saudi arabia 's petroleum company aramco   because petroleum is traded in dollars when aramco makes a sale its paid in usd some of that is going to be reinvested into the company some paid out in dividends to share holders but inevitably some of that will be saved someplace where it can make interest because treasuries are traded issued in dollars and because aramco 's businesses deals primarily in dollars treasuries are the natural place to store that savings especially because the market considers them extremely safe    if they exchange the usd into the saudi currency to store the money in saudi assets aramco is subject to   exchange rate if the depreciates relative to the dollar aramco will lose wealth on the exchange back to dollars when they go to move those funds back into their business it 's in their interest to deal with assets denominated in usd i.e. t bonds in order to avoid this   so now because the saudis want t bonds as well the additional demand pushes the market price of our bond from $ 100 to $ 102 and the effective one year borrowing rate for the government goes from 5 to 2.9       105 = = 2.9   and there you have it cheaper borrowing it 's also worth noting how this encourages business around the world to deal in dollars which are directly controlled by the federal reserve this makes the us 's position extremely powerful

or at least use the equity in the medallion to diversify borrow against the medallion to buy an income property or put it into a balanced portfolio of financial securities it looks like the same problem with real estate people are spending their capital instead of putting it to work holding most of your wealth in a single asset and then borrowing against that asset to fund consumption is a recipe for bankruptcy

it 's so that your total mortgage payment stays the same every month obviously the interest due each month decreases over time as part of the principal is paid off each month and so if the proportion of interest and principal repayments were to stay the same then your first payment would be very large and your last payment would be almost nothing

gt;since gold in this very simple hypothetical system has absolutely no use other than a store of value it is debt   but gold does have other uses it is a metal that 's used for jewelry it has decorative value exchanging something for gold is like a giving you a stone ax if you do some cave for him   if all the civilization disappeared gold would still have a value different from bank notes   gold is a convenient standard commodity for exchange for several reasons it 's it 's compact it 's easily recognizable all the gold ever mined in the world would fit inside a typical five story apartment building yet it does n't burn does n't spoil can be stored forever different from apples or oranges   gt;these firms would be adjusting their capacity and not sitting on trillions of dollars of currency that ought to be liquid    here s where the difference between actual work that has been performed and a promise make a real difference these companies are sitting on trillions of dollars of promises not products what they have is paper shares bonds debentures whatever    they are unable to transform those papers into products because they lack the manufacturing capacity to do so they do not have a million apples they have a paper where the farmer said he would grow a million apples   overall the corporations in the us have invested heavily in acquisitions of other corporations this trend has been going on for several decades now these papers can not be easily converted into anything useful for the moment they are just there with their nominal value that people agreed upon it 's not easy to turn that investment into production

yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor

do you have a regular job where you work for somebody else and they pay you a salary if so they should be deducting estimated taxes from your paychecks and sending them in to the government how much they deduct depends on your salary and what you put down on your w-4 assuming you filled that out accurately they will withhold an amount that should closely match the taxes you would owe if you took the standard deduction have no income besides this job and no unusual deductions if that 's the case come next april 15 you will probably get a small refund if you own a small business or are an independent contractor then you have to estimate the taxes you will owe and make quarterly payments if you 're worried that the amount they 're withholding does n't sound right then as says get a copy of last year 's tax forms or this year 's if they 're out by now paper or electronic fill them out by estimating what your total income will be for the year etc and see what the tax comes out to be

gt because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   gt gt you fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens   operating in a country that allows you to make profit in my opinion establishes a duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes   paying legislators to make laws enabling tax avoidance is in my mind unethical   clearly we have a different idea of what is ethical and not gt corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region   gt the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure   yes    gt keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by   corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden   that 's like your opinion man   i do n't think minimizing taxes by paying off legislators is equitable call me crazy   gt;if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do   more relevant example is if i order a pizza have it sent to your house then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you demanding you pay it you never asked for the pizza maybe you did n't want the pizza maybe you did n't eat the pizza maybe you do n't like pizza or do n't like that kind of pizza that i choose to send you a pizza does not you to pay for that pizza   lost me on this one bro i thought we were talking ethics not surprise pizzas   how about this one    i go to your house use your kitchen and ingredients to make a pizza sell the pizza for a profit and give you nothing even though we had an agreement that if i could make a profit i would give you some   however i decide to talk to your roommate and give him a measly dollar to say forget about it bro i said it 's cool

strictly by the numbers putting more than 20 down is a losing proposition   with interest rates still near all time lows you 're likely able to get a mortgage for less than 4 the real rate of a return on the market subtracting inflation and taxes is going to be somewhere around 5 6   so by this math you 'd be best off paying the minimum to get out of pmi and then investing the remainder in a low fee index fund the question becomes how much that 1 2 is worth to you vs how much the job flexibility is worth it boils down to your personal risk preference life conditions etc so it is difficult to give good advice   the 1 2 difference in your rate of return is not going to be catastrophic     personally i would run the numbers with your fiance   build a spreadsheet tracking your estimated net worth under the assumption that you make a 20 down payment and invest the rest   then hold all other factors equal and re build the spreadsheet with the higher down payment   factor in one of you losing your job for a few years or one of you taking off for a while to raise the kids    you can make a judgement call based how the two of you feel about those numbers

there is more than one exchange where stock can be traded    for example there is the new york stock exchange and the london stock exchange   in fact if you look at all the exchanges there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments eg us government bonds the closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the nyse   however options close after that and so there is after the close trading in many stocks with active options so the price at the close of options trading at cboe is often used the real price is always changing   but for the purpose of discussion using the closing price in nyse for nyse listed stocks is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned   likewise using bloomberg 's price makes sense using some after hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers until tomorrow

this whole article sounds like it was paid off by cable and internet providers do n’t get me wrong these web companies definitely need to be hammered down on specially after what happened this past election   however this article is trying to make a point that getting rid of net neutrality is the right thing to do net neutrality is the rule that prevents cable internet companies to charge you more for access to certain websites than others in a similar way they do with television today the same cable internet companies that lobbied and won the right to sell your browsing history the same way these web companies do   and if we talk about monopolies we should also be looking at at&amp;t comcast verizon and various other companies that have a strong hold on today ’s consumers

if your broker lets you you could just short gld shares the borrow cost is de minimis it looks like it 's basically zero at the moment and there 's no real upfront cost aside from the margin you 'd have to post against the position do n't forget to set a stop though    you can also look at buying lower strike puts the lower the strike the cheaper the cost do n't go selling calls that 's probably outside your risk profile

as usual you missed the point   sam the director of regulatory policy for said in his report that the regulatory freeze that took effect on day one of the administration has persisted for roughly the first four months of president trump 's term by virtually any measure dating back through two democratic presidents and one republican president the lack of regulatory output is historic   what 's more the cost of the new regulations has dropped from an average of $ 26 billion to $ 33 million or just 0.12 of the past average for the first five months of the year   across the board the results indicate a significant in the number of regulations approved and a notable uptick in the number of withdrawn measures previous rules from the obama administration no longer under consideration for instance during the period covered the average administration reviewed 190 rules the trump administration reviewed 39 in the average year there were 33 economically significant reviews the trump administration reviewed just 16 on average there were significant rules approved not just reviewed this administration has released 10 said his study   concluded regardless of the metric employed there is little doubt regulatory output is at historic lows the regulatory freeze has not been temporary but relatively permanent
