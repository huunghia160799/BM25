investing in an existing company is almost like buying a house or even becoming an angel investor in a start up before you start the process decide how much you want to be involved in the day to day and which industries you would feel most comfortable in   the latter is an important consideration since you would have to know sufficient about the industry in order to evaluate the quality of your prospective investment searching for a suitable business is a time consuming process the guidance for evaluating any company has been answered in another question so i 'll simply link most business owners are looking to their businesses to provide them a pension so they often look to sell around retirement age   buying such a business is tricky you may be assisting the next generation to finance the purchase which can have it 's own struggles ideally you 'll be looking for a company with proven sales and which is looking to finance growth in an optimal way   such a company may have many options for raising capital so you 'll be competing to invest as to whether or not it 's a good idea   kfc only became a household name and global franchise after pete joined sanders as a partner   richard and maurice mcdonald may have founded mcdonald 's but it was ray who made it a success new partners bring in new ideas and fresh energy which the original entrepreneurs may have lost during the difficulties of starting out but that goes back to my first query just how much do you want to get involved

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

so you 're making $ 150,000 per year and you have $ in debts you 're in your late 30s and have $ or less than 1/3 of a year 's pay put away for retirement that 's a bad situation but not disastrous lots of people have recovered from far worse but like the old joke goes when you realize that you 're deep in a hole stop digging the worst thing you could do right now is liquidate the few assets you have and go deeper into debt i do n't know where you live or what the housing market is there but the easy answer is find a cheaper house   i 'm not sure what you mean about affect the resale value yes if you buy a cheaper house it will have a lower resale value so what the days when a house was an investment that would skyrocket in value are over and even in those days it did n't help most people so when you move you get a big profit on the sale of your house but the house you 're moving to probably went up by a similar percentage so you really did n't gain anything even if your house did increase in value unless you sell it that does n't help you make the mortgage payments it 's a paper profit get yourself out of debt step 1 is to stop taking on new debts and if at all possible you should be putting bare minimum 6 into your retirement plan i do n't know where you work but most employers match some percentage of the first 6 you put in if you do n't take advantage of that you 're giving up free money

at the end of each period add the interest in this case an easy 1 and then subtract the payment with less than 4 months to payoff the interest here is about $ 21   instead of trying to find credit card calculators just use the more common mortgage calculator the math is the same until the final month when the credit card may handle accrued interest slightly differently   edit a finance calculator indicates payments or total payment of $ $ is interest   from my initial guess of $ 21 above

as weird as it seems 5 years is not a long term investment   furthermore investing is about accepting risk   based on your criteria for the alternative to a down payment i think your only choice is to make the larger down payment if however you were willing to invest that money for the long term in a retirement account or an educational account for example then i would definitely encourage you to invest   i think the chance that a long term investment in a diversified investment account will exceed 3.25 is pretty high   however that is only my opinion and i am not so your let your personal tolerance to risk be your guide but again based on the way you asked it down payment all the way   your time frame means you are not an investor   therefore your only option for risk free storage of money is an fdic insured account which might pay a little less than 1 for the next 5 years   a bigger down payment will have a 3.25 return in this case in that order   4 and 5 could be swapped if the interest rate on the loans is really low

of course they make money they double dip in a lot of instances they make 2 3 plus $ 0.30 per transaction from the merchant and then whatever interest you pay on your card so let 's just say in one day you make stops at starbucks for a $ 4 latte then at wendy 's for lunch for about $ 8 then you put about $ 20 worth of gas in your tank then you stop at kroger for some $ 40 groceries and may you pick up some dinner for about $ 15   that 's 5 transactions at $ 0.30 which is a $ 1.50 then at 3   starbucks is $ 0.12 wendy 's $ gas is $ then kroger $ 1.20 then dinner $ 0.45 so the total that they get is $ multiply this by about   a million people per day that is about $ 4.1 million per day that they get that is a nice penny just from the merchant so you are making them a lot of money by just using it

without knowledge of the special provisions of your loan contract the one with the highest interest rate should be paid first or if one 's fixed payment is much larger than the other and it is a burden then it should be paid first but refinancing may be an option socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible economically speaking i would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades probably exceeding the term of the loan but some caveats must be handled first many would disagree but i finance the way i play poker tight aggressive

no firstly i think that free market economic theories of healthcare are because there is no such thing as consumer who can make properly informed customer   and secondly an economist can never understand the risks associated with healthcare because they will never have a patient die as a result of their decision making being an economist is a trivial job when compared to being a doctor losing money is not remotely the same as inadvertently causing a patient 's death   so they will never really understand the forces that motivate the healthcare economy

i think so   i am doing this with our furniture   it does n't cost me any more money to pay right now than it will to pay over the course of 3 years and i can earn interest on the money i did n't spend but know this they are n't offering 0 they are deferring interest for 3 years   if you pay it off before then great if you do n't you will owe all the accumulated interest the key with these is that you always pay it and on time   miss a payment and you get hosed   if you do n't pay on time you will owe the interest that is being deferred   they will also be financing this through a third party like a major bank and that company is now doing business with you which means in the us they can call you and solicit new services   i am willing to deal with those trade offs though plus as you say you can always pay it off why they do it what is in it for them a friend of mine works for a major bank that often finances these deals here is how they work basically banks do this to generate leads for their divisions that do cold calls   if you are a high credit high income customer you go to a classic bank and request cash if you are building credit or have bad credit you go to a financial services branch   if you tend to finance things like cars and furniture you get more cold calls

depending on the improvement you have to amortize or depreciate it over time which effectively allows you to write off the value over a period of years even if you pay for it all up front this messes with cash flow which is different than profitability but when you span the write off over five or ten years the distinction between cash flow and profitability for a private self funded company is irrelevant if the money ai n't there the money ai n't there operating capital is life blood   taxes also alter the roi equation of the investment since you do n't keep all the money you put in   way over simplified example lets say i close out the year with some arbitrary profit ten million bucks in my war chest 3.5 could go to taxes i also know that my supplier ca n't handle my volume for next year while the season is hot so i 'd like to buy inventory in the off season last year i sold 6.5 mill worth of stuff from this supplier but i estimate i could sell 9 10 mill if i did n't have availability problems if i buy 9 10 mill in inventory i ca n't pay taxes if i pay taxes i ca n't buy enough to grow next year    sure cogs is a deductible expense but the expense is n't realized until the inventory is sold which wo n't be until long after these taxes are due   i now have taxes interfering with my expansion even though eventually i can write that off   now lets look at the manufacturer sure he could expand his capacity and make more money but he has to deduct the 5 mill machine he needs over twenty years or ten or whatever while the purchase price needs to be made today this year he 's gon na pay tax on 90 or 95 of the money he used to buy that machine which would eat into the money he needs to buy raw materials to fill orders he already has   of course the real world is much more complicated and you can leverage leasing agreements and purchasing terms to alleviate this to some extent but i wanted to illustrate a point i hope my extremely simplified example communicated what i mean   does that make sense

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

i think many of you are making unrelated comments and taking unjustified conclusions from the news without reading the research many of the mentioned share provisions are not exclusive to silicon valley technology firms or the rest of private equity i.e. ex vc   the paper says   gt;these generous terms are not necessarily evidence of active post money valuation manipulation and could simply be due to a difficult fund raising environment   and   our discussion does not imply that these terms were given for the purpose of manipulating spacex ’s value   that is not to say that i am not skeptical of many of the business models and valuations of the companies in the sample but that is off the research topic    what the authors suggests is that valuation is often by many people in the industry and provides some relevant cases from mutual funds who market those shares at the value of the most recent funding round regardless of share provisions to employees that wrongly perceive their wealth   i have some trouble accepting brownian motion to model exit prices or pretty much anything else it seems a bit off from reality but nevertheless i think the paper is worth the read

most 0 interest loans have quite high interest rates that are deferred if you are late on a payment you are hit with all the deferred interest they 're banking on a percentage of customers missing a payment   also this is popular in furniture car sales because it 's a way to get people to buy who otherwise would n't they made money on the item sale so the loan does n't have to earn them money even though some will traditional banks lenders do make money from interest and rely on that they would have to rely on fees if interest were not permitted

yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor

i 'm not sure about the laws in specific states however it 's part of their merchant agreement that they can not charge a fee for a customer paying with credit card it 's also against merchant agreements to require a minimum purchase to use a credit card although this is less commonly enforced apparently merchants can offer a cash discount offering payment by credit card though practically a requirement in todays retail environment is a privilege for the merchant it 's a way of making buying convenient for the customer as a result penalizing the customer in any way is not just against their agreement but rather disingenuous as well edit here 's a bit more information about what they can and ca n't do amex prohibits discrimination so if a merchant ca n't do something to a visa mc customer they ca n't do it to an amex customer either

the context actually was higher education and student debt load which extends to cost you can try to broaden it but the title of the thread the linked article the comment i replied to and my comments all reference higher education and costs once again your comment is correct in a broader context just not in the one we were in at least not to all readers clearly    you want to be right but what you need to accept is that you just your post tbh i agree with you on most points here and should likely add some more detail to your statements

it 's interesting that the most upvoted comments miss the point entirely   they did not have tax insurance escrows   they make the point that they were not required by their loan docs to have escrows   further they make the point that despite not being required to have escrows and being current on taxes and insurance b of a paid the taxes in duplicate and forced insurance   i have several mortgages with b of a from acquired companies   i have been current on insurance on all accounts with the same insurance provider since before the four years or so boa has owned serviced the accounts   at least once a year boa either notices me that they are going to or actually does force place insurance   if i do n't catch them in time it can be 8 10 phone calls over several months to get credited back properly

well you would have to take into account 2 things 1 the taxes and regulations that fossil fuel industries face relative to renewables 2 subsidies as a percent of fossil fuel industry compared to subsidies as a percent of green energy companies my hunch is that both of these points show that overall the fossil fuel industry is n't benefiting from the government and renewable companies are benefiting

its the economics subreddit people post here to talk about economics i assume people here have attention spans long enough to read a few paragraphs   i can understand your issue with principal i understand people who will willingly take a worse system that costs more just to fuck over a drug addict i 'm not one of them   personally i would pay zero dollars extra to fuck over drug addicts and i have no desire to have worse quality care so drug addicts can be denied care   i want the system that is a good balance between cost and quality sure the trade off of paying less for better is when everyone else is covered there will be people who i do n't like and who made poor choices that will also get that coverage i suppose one could make a single payer system that also does n't cover drug addicts maybe that would be ideal for you however studies also find that paying for these drug addicts lazy assholes also saves money in the long run i assume you do n't want to explore the theories as to why statistically this is the case because you know tl dr   i 'm sorry you do n't like the ideas do n't worry about ideas worry about facts and reality base what you agree with on reality i 'm going to go out on a limb i think if you thought about it saving yourself and your family money for better treatment will rank higher than the principal of denying treatment to those who you do n't like     once you establish what you value abandon ideology see what works best with what you value and go from there i would make a guess that one of the reasons americans are absolutely ripped off when it comes to medical costs is because people do n't agree with ideas

i was able to attend an open discussion on illinois pensions a few years back   dick head of the illinois teacher 's retirement system spoke as did a public employee union leader governor 's budget director and who is a state   it was eye opening on many levels   some of the points that stick with me are       the state has never over 30 years followed standard practice and used an actuary to determine how much to put into the pension funds each year   the legislators just pulled numbers out of the air each year   as a result the pensions have never been properly funded    the benefits are rich but according to the people on this panel the main issue is this under funding      some years the state declared a pension holiday and put nothing into the pension funds at all   when this was brought up the largely union crowd started to turn on but she held up her hand said she had voted against that and then commented that the unions all signed off on the pension holidays   as one the crowd 's heads turned to the union rep on the board   he turned red and at the floor      2/3 of the teacher 's pension hole is for people already retired   changing benefits for current teachers will not help enough      i asked mr how much additional tax he would need to plug the hole in the system he manages   he answered double   i asked for how long   he said it does n't work like that   i 'd need double the current amount forever   i came away much better informed but deeply   like 69 of the people polled i want these teachers and public employee to get their money   i just do n't see how it can happen

the existing answers are good i wanted to provide a simpler answer to your question would i be able to invest this in a reasonable way that it would provide me with say $ 200 spending money per month over the school year no there is no way to invest $ 10,000 to reliably get $ 200 every month   any way that you invest it that has even the possibility of getting that much will have a significant possibility of losing a lot of money   if you want to get free spending money out without risk of losing money you 're unlikely to be able to find an investment that will give you more than a couple dollars per month

the conventional wisdom is that you should have about 5 of your portfolio in gold but that 's an average meaning that you might want to have 10 at some times like now and 0 in the 1980s right now the price of gold has been rising because of fears of easing fed monetary policy for the past decade in recent quantitative easing in the 1980s you should have had 0 in gold given the fall of gold in 1981 because of paul volcker 's monetary tightening policies and other reasons why did gold prices drop in 1981 and a word of caution if you do n't understand the impact of quantitative easing or paul volcker on gold prices you probably should n't be buying it

it is important to remember that the tax brackets in the u.s. are marginal   this means that the first part of your income is taxed at 10 the next part at 15 next at 25 etc   therefore if you find yourself just on the edge of a tax bracket it really does not make any difference which side of that line you end up falling on that having been said of course reducing your taxable income reduces your taxes   there are lots of deductions you can take if you qualify   depending on what type of health insurance coverage you have a health savings account hsa is a great way to shelter some income from taxes   charitable contributions are also an easy way to reduce your taxes you do n't really personally benefit from them but if you 'd rather send your money to a good cause than to uncle sam that 's an easy way to do it

why are there so many stock exchanges in the world   the simple answer is that there is a lot of money to be made by charging fees to facilitate the trading of securities but there are other factors at play here relating to new technologies trading volumes have increased rapidly in recent years   according to this data in 1997 6.5 billion shares were traded on us exchanges   by 2015 this number had increased to billion shares   there are a number of reasons for this rapid increase in volumes   most significant would be the introduction of new technologies that allow for high volume high frequency trading this increase in activity has be accompanied by an increase in the number of stock exchanges   as cqm points out in his answer there has been considerable consolidation in the ownership of legacy exchanges   for example the nyse merged with in 2007 and the combined group is now owned by the exchange which also owns numerous smaller stock exchanges as well as a number of derivative commodities exchanges however this consolidation in ownership has been more than matched by the creation of many virtual exchanges    in north america these virtual exchanges are called alternative trading systems   in europe they are called trading facilities    these new virtual exchanges sometimes referred to as dark pools have begun to significantly eat away at the volumes of the legacy exchanges   if you look at the data linked above you will see that the total volume of shares traded on legacy exchanges actually peaked in 2008 and has since then has decreased   this coincides roughly with the appearance of the virtual exchanges and the new high frequency trading methods   according to this paper from the sec site dated 2013 alternative trading systems accounted for of total volumes in 2012   this will have increased rapidly in the years since 2012   it is this loss of business that has prompted the consolidation in the ownership of the legacy exchanges these new exchange are conceptually the same as the legacy exchanges and must play by the same regulatory rules

let 's do a real example of leverage on the spy imagine you have $ 20 k today and plan on having $ 100 k by jan 2018   you could get 100 shares of spy and ride it out   maybe buying another 100 shares every few months until 2018 ending up with less than 500 shares to your name and zero cash in the bank or you could lever with dec 2017 leap calls they 'll expire in 2.5 years so you 'd have to re up sooner than your plan    with 20 k starting cash in my example we 'll go with 5 contracts to start with   if we choose the $ 230 strike they 'd cost $ 1250 each putting roughly $ at risk    the plan in is if the stock market goes up you 've got leverage   you are the proud owner of contracts worth 500 shares of spy and have only spent 1/3rd of your present day dollars   if the market goes down in the next two years sure you lost the entire $ but likely saved $ powder dry and can try your luck with the 2021 leaps    probably get down votes for this but i 'll even argue that proper use of leverage can very much reduce your risk    one truth is you 'll never get a margin call from holding long options

there were several areas where the mortgage and car loan have affected your credit   the mortgage had the following impacts the car loan purchased shortly after the house had the following impacts you did not mention your payment history but since you had an 800 prior to the house purchase we can assume that your payment history is current nothing late you did not mention your credit utilization but you want to keep your utilization low various experts suggest 10 20 and 30 as thresholds   the down payment on the house likely drained your available funds and replacing the car may have also put stress on your funds   and when you buy a house often there are additional expenses that further strain budgets my guess is that your utilization percentage has increased   my suggestion would be to reduce your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts   and since you have plenty of credit lines you might want to payoff the car your chase card has a good age which helps with age of credit and though you will find experts that say you should only have 2 4 revolving accounts credit cards other experience shows that having accounts with age on them is a good thing   and having a larger number of accounts does not cause problems unless you have higher utilization or you miss payments you did not mention whether the chase card has any fees or expenses as that would be a reason to either negotiate with chase to reduce or eliminate the fees or to cancel the card have you checked your credit report for errors   you can get a free report from each of the three bureaus once per year

time for a lawyer essentially regardless of the situation it 's not right for him to be paying the mortgage and only get half the value out of the equity in the house all other things aside no court i can think of would allow that the could happens are many but the most common include keep in mind that if he keeps paying the mortgage enough most courts will end up giving him ownership outright essentially they will say he has already bought her out by paying her half of the debt   unfortunately any way he goes he is going to need to take action when there is a missed mortgage payment a bad tax year or some other legal issue some one is injured on the property the last thing he is going to want is for the courts to decide the issue for him for example john breaks an arm while climbing a tree on the property line john takes the owners of the property to court he says but my sister owns half and the courts decide then and there that because he 's been paying the mortgage alone he owns the house alone seems like a win except now he owns the liability alone and owns john $ 1,000,000 for a silly lawsuit alone   point is this ownership of property comes with risks and responsibilities he really needs to get those risks and responsibilities under control so he can mitigate them or he could end up in a very nasty situation in the years to come

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

all standard mortgage promissory notes mandate payments are due on the first of every month i can almost guarantee the note you signed has this provision   most lenders offer a grace period of generally 15 days before they assess a late charge but the payment is late on the 2nd   people have become incorrectly accustomed to believe that the payment is due between the 1st and 15th if they are servicing your loan for another investor a private investor etc they may have contractual requirements to begin collection activities by a certain date so they are within the rights you granted them   if these calls really bug you you can start to adjust your cashflow so you can perhaps make your payment a few days ahead of the first each month

yeah that all can definitely be true as well in fact we both 100 agree on symptoms of low growth however personally i believe there are always ways to reinvest and build your business i mean look at aapl they allocated $ billion into their own nevada hedge fund buying up high quality debt like it 's a fire sale some companies create their own vc firms disruptive innovation we can argue about this all we want but share buybacks can a lot of things at the end of the day haha my main point with the comment above was that the buybacks inflating eps makes it more difficult to identify true earnings growth of a company    so serious question do you know of any ways to filter that out and identify real earnings growth

in general you need to ask yourself how serious you are about tracking your finances   if your gnucash cleared balance does n't match your statement it represents an error on either your part or much less likely the banks part   tracking down this error might be a real pain but you will also likely learn from it   so to answer your question find the entry or entries that do n't match and fix them    that said sometimes indeed this can be very tedious time consuming and frustrating especially if it is for a relatively small dollar amount   time too is money so in these cases the expense adjustment might be a reasonable approach

my employer matches 1 to 1 up to 6 of pay they also toss in 3 4 or 5 percent of your annual salary depending on your age and years of service the self directed brokerage account option costs $ 20 per quarter that account only allows buying and selling of stock no short sales and no options the commissions are $ per trade plus $ 0.01 per share over 1000 shares i feel that 's a little high for what i 'm getting i 'm considering 401k loans to invest more profitably outside of the 401k specifically using options contrary to what others have said i feel that limited options trading the sale cash secured puts and spreads can be much safer than buying and selling of stock i have about options trading in this account since the trustee 's system shows options right on the menus but they are all disabled i was told that the employer decided against enabling options trading due to the perceived risks

the price earnings ratio is calculated as the market value per share divided by the earnings per share over the past 12 months in your example you state that the company earned $ 0.35 over the past quarter that is insufficient to calculate the price earnings ratio and probably why the pe is just given as 20 so if you have the formula correctly the calculation given the numbers in your example would be 0.35 4 20 = $ as to i 'm not sure your pe is correct according to yahoo the pe for is at the time of writing not using the formula above this would lead to 2.3 4 = $ that stock has a 52-week high of $ so $ is not unrealistic i 'm more than a little dubious of the validity of that formula however and urge you not to base your investing decisions on it

lets make some assumptions you are not close to retirement   you have no other debts   you have a job   you have no big need for the money    you should invest that   do not invest with a bank they are not as competitive on fees as a brokerage account you can get specific answers that are different from every person so you should dig in and research a lot more if you care and you should   personally i would suggest you open an account with one of the low cost providers then with that new investment account put your money into a target retirement account   file your statements away and tend to it once a year   make sure it is there that you can access it that nothing alarming is going on   you certainly have enough to start an investment account   if you want to get more into it ask a phone adviser what you should open finally before you start investing make sure you follow the advice of and have no debt saving the most you can for retirement a rule of thumb is your money will double every 72 months congratulations you are a saver   investing is n't for you as the risk of investing is in conflict with your desire to you money open a savings account or high interest checking account with a credit union online only or local community bank   shop around no the web for the highest interest   do n't get your hopes up though the highest rate you see that does n't have strings attached wo n't be much here late summer of 2012

tricky question basically you just want to first spread risk around and then seek abnormal returns after you understand what portions of your portfolio are influenced by and understand your own investment goals for a relevant timely example the german stock exchange and it 's equity prices are reaching all time highs while the greek asset prices are reaching all time lows if you just invested in europe your portfolio will experience only the mean while suffering from exchange rate changes you will likely lose because you arbitrarily invested internationally for the sake of being international instead of targeting a key country or sector just boils down to more research for you if you want to be a passive investor you will get passive investor returns i 'm not personally familiar with funds that are good at taking care of this part for you in the international markets

how are derivatives like covered warrants or cfds different from the bucket shops that were made illegal in the us after reading up a little on the topic the core difference seems to be that bucket shops were basically running betting pools with everyone betting against the operator whereas cfds and similar derivatives are traded between speculators and the operator merely provides a market and checks the liquidity of participants a seems to be a different matter that i 'm not fully sure i understand at least the description of wikipedia seems to contradict your statement about not trade being performed on the underlying security should i worry that some regulator decides that my market maker is an illegal gambling operation not really nations with a mature financial industry like japan invariably have heavy regulations that mandate constant auditing of institutions that sell financial instruments in japan the financial services agency is in charge of this it 's almost impossible that they would let an institution operate and later decide that its basic business model is illegal what is possible are mainly two scenarios

i do n't know what rates are available to you now but yes if you can refinance your car at a better rate with no hidden fees you might save some money in interest however there are a couple of your original loan was a 6 year loan and you have 5 years remaining   if you refinance your car with a new 6 year loan you will be paying on your car for 7 years total and you will end up paying more interest even though your interest rate might have gone down   make sure that your new loan in addition to having a lower rate than the old loan does not have a longer term than what you have remaining on the original loan make sure there are n't any hidden fees or closing costs with the new loan   if there are you might be paying your interest savings back to the bank in fees if your goal is to save money in interest consider paying off your loan early   scrape together extra money every month and send it in making sure that it is applied to the principal of your loan   this will shorten your loan and save you money on interest and can be much more significant than refinancing   after your loan is paid off continue saving the amount you were spending on your car payment so you can pay cash for your next car and save even more

i think it 's worth pointing out explicitly that the biggest difference between a credit card us canada and a debit card like your french carte de is that with a credit card it 's entirely possible to not pay the bill or to pay only the minimum payment when asked this results in you owing significantly more money due to interest which can snowball into higher and higher levels of debt and end up getting rapidly out of control this is the reason why you should always pay off the entire balance every month as to in the other answers it 's not uncommon to find people in the us with thousands of dollars of debt they ca n't pay off from misuse of credit cards

i believe it is so   it does n't sound like they did anything outright illegal just a pushy upsell   you can complain to the bank manager   if you want you can mention the employee by name if you know who they are   ultimately you can change banks   from what you say it sounds like you are with this bank so i think you should at least begin evaluating other banks and consider switching   you can also let your current bank know you are planning to take all your money away from them specifically because of their poor customer service you could consider filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau alleging that the bank engaged in some kind of deceptive marketing of their financial products   of course you can also file a complaint with something like the better business bureau or even just write a negative yelp review   but these actions wo n't really result in any penalty for the bank as a result of what they did in your specific case they just express your in a way that will be recorded and possibly made public e.g. in a list of complaints to protect future consumers if you 're really gung ho and have time and money to burn you could hire a lawyer and get legal advice about whether it is possible to sue the bank for fraud or misuse of your personal information   needless to say i think this would be overkill for this situation   i would just cancel the credit card tell the bank you 're switch banks and move on

the price of the loan may be justified if you 're considered a high risk applicant for some reason e.g. you 're putting very little money in initial payment and if it includes all the associated expenses what is more relevant to your situation is that you 're probably better off renting think about it your $ house will require some repairs in those 30 years let 's estimate those at $ that means in 30 years you 'll build $ of equity spending $ on it of course this assumes that the value of the house will remain constant you 're effectively be throwing away $ or more than $ a month if you can rent a place for $ a month or less you 'll build more equity by renting that place for 30 years and saving the excess money in a bank account if you consider the interest that money in your bank account will earn you e.g. 3 annually you 'll build more than $ equity in 30 years even if you spend as much as $ on your rent and save only $ 350 a month

basically you need to use a time value of money equation to discount the cashflows back to today the wikipedia formula will likely work fine for you then you just need to pick an effective interest rate to use in the calculation run each of your amounts and dates though the formula there are various on line calculators to pick from and sum up the values you did not mention your location or jurisdiction but a useful proxy for the interest rate would be the average between the same duration mortgage rate and fixed deposit rate at your bank it should be close enough for your purposes although if an actual lawsuit is involved and the sums high enough to have lawyers it might be worth engaging an accountant as well to defend the of both the calculation and the interest rates chosen

this is a super contentious topic but we have to have a floor wage because we do n't have a free labor market   in order for the labor market to come up with a fair wage the market must be as close to de regulated as possible but we 've already seen what happens in an unregulated or low regulation market safety problems child labor abysmal wages   just ready a history book to see how the us down on sweat shops child labor and the rise of the unions    no one wants to work like that so we put regulations in place to fix those things this is why we have safety laws and rules to prevent our employers from stealing wages due to filing a report late or other stupid excuse    so we make the work places safer and put protections in to make sure people get paid but now we created a wage floor businesses are literally designed to make profit and you make profit by trimming all your expenses as much as necessary skilled employees have an easier time negotiating wages and they can band together in unions but low skilled and unskilled workers do n't have this ability   so they work for minimum wage    now regardless of a company 's ability to pay their workers $ 15/hr or not if you create a wage floor than do n't account for yearly cola inflation workers get left behind why does this matter there is a strong relationship between crime and poverty so we decide to create social programs to keep crime down but as the wage floor is not increased min wage workers require more government subsidy    either companies pay their employees enough where full time workers do n't qualify for government subsidy or the government tax payer ends up picking up the tab on behalf of these companies    you ca n't actually quantify the relationship between min wage and labor because it 's not just a labor issue it impacts crime health who has the ability to pay a $ 30 co pay if you 're chronically ill on min wage and government social welfare on local state and federal levels    we ca n't just demand that unskilled labors get skills so they get more money because that will end up devaluing skilled positions right now people argue that skilled positions are devalued when min wage increases and that 's true only if your employer fails to provide a like increase

gt let 's just say the insurance industry knows a lot more about underwriting than you do   i 'm sorry but that is a meaningless statement i work in insurance first as a consultant before retiring to work in insurance distribution a few years ago and i know that our industry frequently uses flawed or outdated methodologies due to the simple fact that insurance companies are very conservative and very resistant to change when it comes to changes to their core business unless you can show a direct negative impact on the bottom line caused by the currently used method you are unlikely to make any changes at all in this case if the entire us car insurance industry is using the same flawed system it wo n't affect a single company if they also stick to it    until 1996 before the current system was introduced insurance companies in germany used to rate liability insurance for cars almost exclusively by engine power output the industry had known that this method was fundamentally flawed since at least the late 1980s comprehensive and partial coverage had been rated by the new system for a few years at this point which had also taken years to work out but it took additional years of planning negotiations and cooperation by the entire industry to change to the new system for liability    so please do not ever assume that the insurance companies are the experts they know what they are doing it might very well be the case that they are stuck with flawed outdated systems simply because there is no sufficiently strong impulse to change what they do    the current tesla rate adjustment situation is a wonderful example of this it took aaa 5 years since the model s first came out to realise that their initial estimate was wrong it seems unlikely that the accident rate or repair costs have suddenly changed over the last year and take appropriate actions by late 2013 there were easily enough teslas on the road about 20,000 to get data yet nothing happened for nearly another 4 years

i 've had a card cloned 15 years ago and used to buy over 5k of goods in another country so the inconvenience of having a card closed and re issued is quite annoying even though the charges were reversed and i was made whole but these days most cc fraud is n't from a card scanned by a waiter and cloned then used elsewhere mostly it is poorly secured databases or point of sale terminal malware the latter is getting curtailed by cards and the largest source of fraud is now online transactions so called card not present where the merchant has your cc number if their system is breached the bad guys have a wealth of card numbers they sell in an e bay like site on the dark web this is where the citi virtual cc comes in handy here 's how it works to protect the bank and the hassles you go through when a card as to be re issued citi 's virtual ccs let you generate an actual credit card complete with security code and expiration date what is unique is that once the virtual cc is used it can only be used subsequently by that same merchant and is declined by any other you can also set a total limit on what the merchant can charge as well as an expiration date i use them for all my online accounts because they are for all practical purposes immune to the malware that steals cc info even if somehow the virtual cc is used before the merchant makes the initial charge that locks in the cc to their account the charge can be reversed without closing your actual card which has a different number you can manage multiple citi virtual ccs and view charge status close or adjust limits over time so managing them is quite easy with no risk to your primary account

depends on the insurance company itself as well as the costs of treatments imagine an ideal scenario where costs of treatments stayed the same and that all insurance plans were segregated and pulled from the same pool of funds to pay for treatments then employer subsidized health insurance plans would be unaffected by the drama in the aca plans those are the factors to consider from my understanding but i would n't be surprised if the burdens of accepting people that would previously never have been serviced by these companies has greatly distorted the market as a whole

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

try to sell if today 's google stock goes above 669 $ this is relative pegged to primary order with a limit price of $ 669 and an offset from national best offer of $ 0.00 but it is no different than an market order if the market price is $ 669 to begin with   do not sell if the stock keeps climbing beyond 669 unless there is a down tick of is seen this is a trailing stop order with a trailing amount of $ 0.20 it sells if the market price dropped $ 0.20 from the peak   the two orders are contradictory from your comments i think the following is what you want submit trailing stop order when market price is above $ 669   cancel trailing stop order before the end of the day and submit relative pegged to primary order to sell

honestly the best way to manage this risk is to manage your savings appropriately many experts recommend that maintain a reasonably liquid account with 6 your minimum monthly expenses for just this occurrence i know easier said than done right as for insurance i can only speak for what is the case in the us here most mortgages will require you to get pmi insurance until you have at least 20 equity in your house however that insurance only protects the bank from losing money if you ca n't pay it does n't save you from foreclosure or ruining your credit   really the type of insurance you are talking about is unemployment insurance which all states in the us make available to workers via deductions from their paycheck   the best advice i suppose is to keep your expenses low enough to cover them with an unemployment check until you have accumulated enough savings to get through a rough patch that may mean buying a less expensive home or just waiting until you have saved a bigger down payment if you did n't plan ahead and you are already in the house another option might be to extend your mortgage for example from a 20 to a 30 year to reduce your payments to a manageable level a more risky option might be to convert to a variable rate loan temporarily which typically carries a lower interest rate however it might be hard to secure a new loan if you do n't currently have an income

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

i respectfully disagree with @johnfx 's comment regarding new vs used   john knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations the answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small loud cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years if you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now then a new car can be a fine choice   i just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 hyundai and a comparable 2012 hyundai was n't much   furthermore it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market   doing math in my head told me the reduced usage i will get out of the car was n't offset by the slightly lower price depending on the specific age insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars but you have to have carry more insurance so consider that as well   there might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012 but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013 new cars can be cheaper to operate   lower fuel costs better safety and possibly pollution costs   they are tuned up and you know everything about their history repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car so if you car turns out to be a problem your out of pocket is limited these programs do n't mean anything   get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy   if the dealer wo n't let you get the car checked out then they are n't worth your business   certified cars do n't justify their cost according to consumer reports they are more for marketing than reliability do n't waste money on a third party warranty   either the car is good and does n't need it or it needs a warranty and you should n't buy it   if you new car comes with a factory warranty that is fine   radio host clark howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately but never a third party just out of college you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car if for no other reason this likely is n't going to be your car in the near future   only you can answer that if you have a feeling you wo n't keep your tiny car well into your 30s then definitely do n't buy a new car    also my experience only applies to my make and model   certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used is n't much for the most recent model years but there are many more makes and models that do n't pan out that way

you will not benefit at tax time like you did with your initial contributions because you have already benefited and are simply repaying your withdrawn contributions however capital gains are not taxed inside of your rrsp until you withdraw the money let 's say you have $ 10,000 to repay and have all the money now it makes sense to repay it immediately whatever interest or capital gains you make inside of the rrsp are not taxed however your $ 10,000 contribution this year will not offer you any deductions on your tax return there are exactly two reasons i can see to not immediately repay the full amount if able first you may need the money for an emergency fund and there are significant implications for removing money from your rrsp in such a case second if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket when you retire it may not make sense to put any money into an rrsp right now almost certainly you want to repay the entire lump sum if able

depends on how long you 're willing to invest for broadly speaking the best by which i mean more reliably repeatable way to make money from market corrections is to accept them as a fact of life and not sell in a panic when they happen such that the money you already invested can ride back up again put another way just invest your money in one or two broad low cost index funds with dividends reinvested maybe spreading your investment over the course of six months or so and then let time do its work have you worked out how much you 've missed out on by holding your money as cash all this time i presume you 've been saving up a while instead of investing it as you went i suspect that by waiting for your correction you 've already missed out on more than you 're going to make from that correction

this was a really unusual deal because a fund owned by one of the owners of the company was buying much of the shares seems that maybe someone at the company realized that they could get an ipo for much less than 7 because the bank was n't really doing much work or taking much risk for their cut and that nobody figured to put contingencies for this in a contract because how often does it happen   edit do people even read the articles for these things   you do an ipo where an existing shareholder and company director is buying half the deal that 's not quite the same as doing an ipo where the banks are just selling shares to investors that the banks dig up and when that shareholder decides that he 'd rather not buy his escape is not so much refusing to pay for his shares as it is trying to get the deal pulled   if sues the banks they can turn around and sue saying that this is a backdoor way of getting out of their contract

some proportion of the costs of a policy have little to no relationship to miles driven   think of costs of underwriting and more especially sales marketing client acquisition costs auto insurance is n't in the same league as non term life insurance where the commissions and other selling expenses typically exceed the first year 's worth of premiums but the funny tv ads and/or agent commissions are n't free as well as general business overhead also as noted by quid some proportion of claim risk is n't correlated to distance covered think theft flood fire etc there are also differences in the miles that are likely to be driven by a non commercial vehicle for hire driver who puts 25k miles a year vs. one who puts 7k per year   the former is generally going to be doing more driving at higher speeds on less freeways while the latter will be doing more of their driving on crowded urban roads   the former pattern generally has a lower expected value of claims both due to having fewer cars per road mile fewer and driveways and also having any given collision be more likely to result in a fatality paralysis or other lifetime disability claims are generally going to exceed what the insurer would pay out on a fatality

firstly how far behind on rent are they have you sent them notices in writing about late rent and if so how many have you had to send how often do they say they are going to do things like pay overdue rent and they never do to tell you the truth imho if they are starting to be regularly late in rent payments and they do n't do things they say they are going to do then it is time to evict them in nsw australia if the tenant is more than 2 weeks late in rent and prior to them reaching 2 weeks late you have called them asking for late rent and sent notices you can evict the tenants if the tenants do not leave you can apply to the tribunal to get them out and ask for outstanding money to be paid to you however if it does get to this stage the tenants may be pissed off so may do some damage to the property in retaliation then you have to go back to the tribunal to get the tenant 's bond security deposit and any other funds to repair any damages done to your place the longer you leave it the worse it will get we had some tenants similar to this which we finally got out earlier this year they would say they would pay rent due by the end of the week and no money would come by the end of the week we took them to tribunal and got them out and we got the bond plus unpaid rent and other money for damages and leaving the place dirty over and above the bond awarded to us just under $ 4k.   the tenants said they could n't pay and so went on a payment plan to pay about $ every 2 weeks they did n't pay any of the payments so then we went to the local court to get a sheriff to go to their new place and take their property the must have gotten scared from this because they approached the local court and agreed to pay $ 60 per week we have currently received about 10 payments so it will be a long time before we get all our money back as i said the longer you leave it the worse it can get you should also look at improving your criteria for selecting new tenants i have given an answer to this question how to choose a good tenant as a private landlord hopefully it can give you some ideas of what to ask for when searching for your next tenant update due update in question six weeks behind in rent is quite a bit to be behind if the landlord had been asking the tenant to pay the late rent during this period and the tenant had been giving excuses why the rent was late and saying they would pay it by a certain time but never did it is a big sign that they will tell you lies   if this is the first time they have been late in paying rent and now they are back up to date with the rent you might want to give them one more chance if this is a pattern that happens regularly it is better to get them out as it will happen again you will get in an argument with them and then they might stop paying rent altogether you can usually gain a better perspective of the tenants from their action rather than their words that is why their past rental history is so important when finding a new tenant

every time you buy or sell a share for some price somebody must have thought that that was exactly the right moment to sell or buy that share at that price and to trade with you every time a trade is made both sides think they are doing the smart thing most of the time one will turn out to be wrong the other right nothing in your proposed method of trading explains why you would be the side that was right more often so they 'll probably even out or maybe there are people in the market who actually do have a slightly better than average method and you 'll be wrong somewhat more often than right each trade has transaction costs if you simply hang on to your shares that 's more or less the same as evening out good trades and bad trades but without the transaction costs

's answer is fundamentally correct and deserves the but i 'd like to give an economic explanation for how this economically functions the key point from 's answer 's that the interest rate is for one company while this may be much higher than the equilibrium rate the true market interest rate it is not completely unreasonable because of the risk for credit to be continually produced default risk must be compensated because this is a cost to the lender   most are not in business to lose money so making loans to borrowers that default 40 of the time would make this interest rate reasonable for uk citizens this would not be such a problem because the lender can usually pursue the borrower for the balance but if the borrower can the loan and leave the legal reach of the uk creditors the collection rate is 0 the guarantee by the foreign persons not present in the uk is incidental and probably more of a regulatory requirement since the inability to collect from them is just as unlikely one should always look for the lowest price with at least minimum quality when shopping for anything but you are right to be apprehensive legally   read every line and be sure that you yourself understand every clause before signing if alternative cheaper financing is available it is probably superior

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

the estimated cost of $ 200 sqft of living space is achievable by builders who are following one the their standard plans they build hundreds of homes each year across the region using those standard plans they have detailed schedules for constructing those homes and they know exactly how many are need to build house x with options a f   and p. they buy hundreds of dishwashers and get discounts that price also includes the cost of the raw land and the required improvements of the property   you need to know the zoning for that land you need to know what you can build by right and what you can get exceptions for you do n't want to pay $ 600 k and then find out you can only build a 1 level house and you can only use 1/4 acre you would need to start with a design and then have the architect and the builder and a real estate lawyer look over the property then they can give you an estimate of what it would cost to put that design on that property   sqft i mean it can accommodate at least 10 houses it depends on what is the minimum lot size if the maximum allowable density is three houses per acre you can get 6 in 2.2 acres but if the minimum lot size is supposed to be 5 acres then you will need an exception just to build one house and exceptions involve paperwork hearings and lawyers

rather than automating it why not just create a listing that you maintain and display on your site yourself   that way you do n't have to give out credentials or anything else it also presents a bit of a marketing opportunity   you could group contributors by the size of their contributions and thank them publicly   for example maybe your top contributors could be members of the heroes club and you could come up with names for other groups   it 's a way of publicly acknowledging their contributions in a way that they appreciate and perhaps it motivates others to up their own contributions to get into one of the more prominent   it becomes a competitive one thing if that makes sense i understand your desire to be transparent and that 's admirable but see the marketing and public relations opportunity it brings to you as well i hope this helps good luck

i am a realtor and work for rausch coleman and can answer this question for you we are a production builder we build in communities with typically 5 9 options per community and a select set of option and finishes that we offer because of the set options we buy the materials in bulk and are able to receive cost savings on that from our suppliers which we can pass on to you we use the same trades consistently through out our division which means they have our plans and process down to a science they know the product which means less likely to make mistakes and less likely to miss things our heart is affordability in that we understand that not everyone can afford granite gas hardwood floors etc so we allow you to be able to customize your monthly payment and that you are not financing something you may not want or need or to allow you to get in to a home you may not be able to afford otherwise we work a lot with the first time buyer and we want to provide the best quality for the best value we start our homes at a base model and allow you to customize the way you want adding granite gas fireplace etc and in doing that we allow you to choose whether you want to pay $ 90 or $ 101 per square foot or whatever that may be i can tell you in northwest arkansas we are the best value and the quality shows i pull comps consistently and in fact have another builder in the same community as i sell in our homes in this community for single stories is about $ and two story homes are on average $   two stories are more cost efficient in that the square footage goes up and not out so there is less concrete which is one of the most expensive parts of the process this other builder consistently sells their homes for $ per square foot and uses the exact same materials we do the difference yes granite and and gas and custom cabinets come standard you have no choice in that would you rather have the option for a lower priced home if you did n't want granite or if you 'd rather have carpet we build in 5 different markets over 4 states and are in our year of business i 'd love to meet with you and can walk you through a community and show you our homes at all stages of construction where you can see the product and quality in our homes i am in our crossing community here in northwest arkansas you can check out our website for other information at

goodness i wish i could put away half my paycheck not to rain on your parade but a 6-month emergency fund is not quite very good   it is the typical starting time frame   personally i would feel more comfortable with a 2 + year fund   that is a bit extreme but only because many of us can barely seem to make it around to a 6-month fund   so we focus on the more attainable goal i say you do all three   make saving money your priority but do enjoy some of it in moderation   do not plan on making any big purchases with it but know that you will eventually be able able to do so   money not spent is worthless idle money is worthless   make some hopefully prudent investments with some of your money    a small portion of that investment portfolio can should be in speculative investments   maybe even as much as 20 of your investment portfolio since you are young   consider that money gone and you will hopefully be surprised by one of those speculative investments   that is the crucial point earmark a small portion of your investment portfolio which you are willing to lose   however do not gamble with it   research the hot emerging technologies for example and find a way to make an investment so in summary you may have more money that you know what do with right now   however that does not mean you need to go out and spend it all   trust me as you get older you will think of plenty of good uses for that money

i think a lot of people would respond with something like you use bank machines and online banking do n't you   that is the same reason i hear people supporting voting machines and even online voting but the problem is that there are significant differences take a service like mint.com compared with your bank for example   the bank is a regulated company with insurance to back up your money should they make a mistake   even if someone steals your debit card and drains your account you will usually get all your money back   banks have deep pockets and even the government has a vested interest in making sure the banks stay afloat   when they do make a mistake and they will you are usually quite safe on the other hand mint.com is a third party that you are just going to hand over your bank passwords to   i think it is reasonable to ask i am not saying not to use mint.com but it is certainly reasonable to ask these questions

do n't mind the percentages they are highly misleading first saving is making available for future use it might be hoarding investing or a combination thereof it might be for a specific use a car a college education retirement etc or for a non specific use for an emergency for when you decide to spend some of those savings or just for lack of a compelling use as of the moment in first case whatever you save should be available by the date you intend to use it in second case it might be prudent to have savings and investments see below of various liquidity cash you have at hand bank account you can draw next day mutual fund account you can draw in a month maybe something you can only cash in a year etc you will see that the actual percentages you save fluctuate enormously throughout your life varying with the progress of your career changes of marital status and family etc etc what you should really do is to come up with a rough plan of how you expect from right now and to the end of your life at whatever age have enough money for whatever level of comfort you plan for each period of your life allowing for some specified level of then you just execute that plan or change it as you go

most likely yes is insurance against a specific type of peril   life insurance is too but there are fewer exceptions to payout   i 'd imagine that you 'd have to die by accident or be but not die for it to pay out   the exceptions in the policy are what you need to be concerned about if loss of you and your income would be of financial hardship to your wife and your goals for your family then you should consider life insurance if you do consider having your wife buy the policy on you and make sure it 's clear that her funds were paying for it   it may be possible to avoid having the payout go into your estate that way
# 378872
typically this is not an option as the monthly payments are fixed it depends on the willingness of your financing bank for such a change you probably will have to refinance with them or another lender which is not a bad thing as you even can get a lower interest rate potentially as of jan 2017 this will change consider too it could be a better solution to instead invest the 25000 and use the investment returns to fill up the difference every month certainly more effort but you probably come out ahead financially

short answer yes you can put up collateral for someone else 's loan the bank will be happy to take your money give it to the other person and return it to you on completion of the loan keeping the interest the security makes on the money market and the interest they 're charging the other person for themselves if the above does n't sound very appealing you do n't see any benefit from your investment and can be left holding the bag if your friend defaults on their loan it really is n't a great way to spend your money however as assistance to someone else it provides several advantages over directly transferring the money

i do nt really understand how this would work in stocks you are buying a share in a company at a specific price that fluctuates with the value of the company in bonds you are lending money for a specific time period with the hopes of getting your money back plus interest is actual money going to be lent are there going to be different bond products for each company every time they issue new debt it just does n't seem practical to me

there can be a good reason if you own shares issued in a different country for example if you are in the uk and own us shares and take the dividend payments you get some check in us dollars that you will have to exchange to which means you pay fees mostly these fees are fixed so you lose a significant percentage of your dividends by reinvesting and selling shares over some years you got one much bigger check and pay only one fee

if it goes to a millionaire who continues to pay larger bills than others while unemployed then that money goes right back into the economy   the money for unemployment insurance is linked to compensation   if they are millionaires then their compensation has already paid for unemployment insurance   this idea that money is going to turn around and go to some others possibly through some other program is wrong   either you have unemployment insurance or you do n't   you want to withhold unemployment insurance from rich people because you do n't think they are worthy   that is an interesting idea but so far it has never worked politically

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

do n't really know but i can guess firstly everyone thinks the price of gas is too high you drive to work every day and gas is basically the only product who 's price is advertised from the street from that perspective so mentally i argue we an extra 1 percent discount on gas it 's only worth maybe 60 cents a month to me but worth a lot of other fees for the credit card company secondly gas stations are a prime robbery target credit cards mean less cash in the till and less chance for employees to steal from the till and less chance of money finally it 's a competitive market if stations do n't accept a card they 'll lose business to elsewhere there 's a gas station on either side of an intersection and you can always tell which station is a few cents cheaper because it 's the one with customers fueling up while the other one is a ghost town they feel they have to compete on convenience or go under and the credit card companies recruit you into the game with higher cash back rewards

as with everything else it 's a question of trade offs pros for buying in bulk cons for buying in bulk inventory cost you need to purchase more shelving to stock the goods   this is a real cost the psychological effect of having more means you are more likely to use more thus costing you more deflation of the cost of the item should occur over time in a well functioning market economy   a $ 10 item today might be $ 9.50 in one year in real terms there is a real opportunity cost associated with   granted an extra $ 100 in your bank account wo n't be earning too much if you have to spend it one month later but it does mean you have less financial independence for that month risk of spoilage   there is a nonzero risk that your goods could be ruined by flood fire damage you need to decide which of these pros and cons are more important to you   financially you should only buy what you need between shopping trips   in reality the convenience of holding goods in storage for when you need them may outweigh the costs

it also depends on where you work if you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date all income before that date is considered income for state 1 and all income on or after that date is income for state 2   if there is a big   difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet if they had the same rates moving would n't impact your wallet but it would impact each state so make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles register to vote get a new drivers license it becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job in that case where you work might be the deciding factor same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor in other cases it is not for virginia maryland and dc you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are dc md va but if you live in delaware and work in virginia virginia wants a cut of your income tax   so before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states from massachusetts information for nonresident and part year resident income exemptions deductions and credits massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from    sources within massachusetts this includes income a few questions later massachusetts residents and part year residents are allowed a credit    for taxes due to any other jurisdiction the credit is available only    on income reported and taxed on a massachusetts return nonresidents    may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their    massachusetts form the credit is allowed for income taxes paid to the credit is not allowed for taxes paid to the u.s. government or a    foreign country other than canada city or local tax and interest and    penalty paid to another jurisdiction the computation is based on comparing the massachusetts income tax on    income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to    the other jurisdiction the credit is limited to the smaller of these    two numbers the other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you    must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also    enter the credit information on the schedule so if you move your house to new hampshire but continue to work in massachusetts you will owe income tax to massachusetts   for that income even after you move and establish residency in new hampshire

you seem to be from your original point   energy is built into consumer products for the most part the transportation portion to market of it is negligible the plastics cost is virtually nothing today so i 'm not sure the point you 're driving at   your first point seemed to be that reducing energy costs would be a direct benefit to the average civilian which despite the fact that consumerism is somewhat rampant in the usa it 's pretty clear that if people can not afford to buy consumer items they pull back and focus only on the necessities   so i 'm not sure what your point is   or how you arrived to it   or if you 're just trying to support your original statement rather than accepting that maybe it was in error     you stated that cheaper energy will help to solve income inequality   you 've given some reasons but i do n't think any of them really support your statement   income inequality will not be solved by consumers being able to buy cheaper goods you can not infinitely reduce the price of goods until it matches the poorest 's wages that does n't solve the problem but rather just it further   the goods are now cheaper for the super rich who are now considered wealthier

you 're right things can get a little out of hand on reddit the prior post is gone now so i ca n't really remember but the gist of what i meant earlier was that your logic did n't line up in that the price of a stock is indicative of it 's value but does n't equate to it 's value the price is a combination of the perceived intrinsic valuation of the company as well as sentiment the price can go up if people are buying but it does n't necessarily mean the company 's value or financial conditions are improving though it can it 's a common trap to fall into and can lead one to ignore for example revenues falling or other metrics deteriorating merely because the stock price continues up so it must be getting better and better   sorry not a very coherent response if you 're unsure feel free to pm me

points are index based   simple take the total value of the stocks that compose the index and set it equal to an arbitrary number say 100 or 1000   this becomes your base   each day you recalculate the value of the index basket and relate it to the base   so if our index on day 0 was 100 and the value of the basket went up 1 the new index would be 101 points for the example given the percentage change would be   100 =   keep in mind that an index basket will change in composition over time   assets are added and removed as the composition of the market changes   for example the tsx index no longer includes a stock that at one time made up a significant portion of the index   i 'm not sure if a percentage drop in an index is really a meaningful statistic because of that    it is however a good way of looking at an individual instrument

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

personally i think you are approaching this from the wrong angle   you 're somewhat correct in assuming that what you 're reading is usually some kind of marketing material   systematic investment plan sip is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world   dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the us on average verified by many studies individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners   say you decide to invest in a mutual fund dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying when you feel the market is low as an example i 'll compare investing $ 50 per week on versus 1 share per week on or the full $ 850 on the first wednesday    i 'll use the vanguard large cap fund as an example   i realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different i just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle   by investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs   it also keeps your investment easy to budget vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments which is illustrated in the third column above and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing ultimately all of these companies are to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique   if they all called dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging none of them would appear to be unique   so they devise neat acronyms but it 's all pretty much the same idea   trickle your money in to your investments as the money becomes available to you

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

in a free market supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity price is one of the variables that demand   but the problem is employment is n't a free market you can not freely decide not to accept a job because you need some income to live    the wage of an employee especially at the unskilled tier is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs and better yet those jobs can be into shifts and so you can employ more people for less hours or vice versa    the employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result and it 's only connected to the free market of the value of service of a burger    so i 'd guess the market value would steadily drop to about the cost of living in the local area maybe a little below even because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family and further still you can have people themselves by working additional hours    so i reckon you 'd get equilibrium at about 90 of local cost of living if you work an 80 hour week

michael pryor 's answer is accurate to the actual question asked the current accepted answer from dheer is not entirely true but roughly provides an overview of the different entities involved in a typical transaction with some wrong corrected and improved below   the issuing bank the one that issues the credit card to the customer when it comes to the service fee split the issuer bank takes on the majority of the cut in the service fee paid by the merchant to the different entities for example on a 2.5 overall fee paid by merchant roughly 1.5 goes to the issuer 0.3 goes to the card network visa master card etc and the remaining 0.7 goes to the acquiring bank reward programs have a partnership with participating merchants where merchants are charged a higher service fee for the likelihood of driving a higher volume of transactions to the merchant a portion of the rewards also comes from the issuer who shares a percentage of their fee back to the customer in exchange for the same likelihood of making more profit through increased volume in total transactions for example a reward program may charge merchants 4.5 fee with 3.5 of it going to the issuer upto 3 of this can be given back to the customer for their loyalty in using the card service the banks can afford to take as little as 0.5 instead of their regular 1.5 due to the increased volume of transactions and the fixed fee they collect as membership fee note that costco has a similar business plan but they make money entirely of membership fee so with enough clients banks can theoretically afford to run their program entirely on membership fees costing no additional service fee to merchants the service fee depicted above is arbitrary and it can be lowered if the merchant is also a client of the issuing bank that is both the issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same so it is kind of a win win win situation and as usual the banks can afford to make a larger income if the customer ends up paying interest for their credit although the rewards program is not designed accounting on this

you can use 's gambit to convert between usd and cad either direction i have never personally done this but i am planning to convert some cad to usd soon so i can invest in usd index funds without paying the typical 2 conversion fee   you must be okay with waiting a few days for the trades to settle and okay with the fact that the exchange rate will almost certainly change before you sell the shares in the opposite currency the spread on is about 0.01 0.02 and you also have brokerage commissions and fees if you use a discount broker the commissions and fees can be quite low eg to transfer $ 5000 usd to cad using questrade you would deposit the usd into a questrade account and then purchase units of since it is an etf there is no commission on the purchase then you request that they journal the shares over to and you sell them in cad will have about a $ 5 fee in cad and lose about $ 1 on the spread and withdraw the whole thing will have cost you $ 6 cad in lieu of ~$100 you would pay if you did a straightforward conversion with a 2 exchange fee the difference in fees scales up as the amount you transfer increases someone has posted the chat log from when they requested their shares be from to here it looks like it was quite straightforward of course there is a time cost and the nuisance of signing up for an maintaining an account with a broker if you do n't have one already you can do it on non discount brokers but it will only be worth it to do it with a larger amount of money since the commissions are larger note if you have enough room to hold the cad amount in your tfsa and will still have that much room at the end of the calendar year i recommend doing the exchange in a tfsa account the taxes are minimal unless the exchange rate changes drastically while your trades are settling from capital gains or losses while waiting a few days for the trades to settle but they are annoying to calculate if you do it often warning if you do it in a tfsa be sure not to over contribute every time you deposit counts as a contribution and your withdrawals do n't count against the limit until the next calendar year

if you are putting down less than 20 expect to need to pay pmi   when you first applied they should have described you a group of options ranging from minimal to 20 down the monthly amounts would have varied based on pmi down payment and interest rate the maximum monthly payment for principal interest taxes and insurance will determine the maximum loan you can get the down payment determines the price of the house above the mortgage amount   during the most recent real estate bubble lenders created exotic mortgage options to cover buyers who did n't have cash for a down payment or not enough income for the principal and interest or ways to sidestep pmi many of these options have disappeared or are harder to get you need to go back to the bank and get more information on your different options or find a lender broker who will help you

largely it comes down to the complexity of your return likely relatively simple if it 's your first time filing and your comfort level with using software more complex returns would include filing business claims handling stocks and investments special return forms etc   one benefit to most of the software options out there such as turbotax hr block and tax are that they are free to use and you only pay when you 're ready to file you could give them a shot to see how easy difficult they are and if you feel overwhelmed then contact a cpa whose time wo n't be free also remember that those hr block seasonal places that open up are not cpa 's but are temps hired and trained to use the software that you would find online you did n't indicate they were an option but i like to point that out to those who might not know otherwise   my opinion would be to use one of the online options because of cost and their ease of use they also allow you to take your time and save your progress so you can start using it and go ask questions do research on your own time

whether it 's historically stronger or weaker is n't going to have an impact on you the forex exposure you have is going forward if the exchange rates change you will have missed out on having more or less value by leaving it in a certain currency    ignoring fees say you exchange € 85 for $ 100 if while you 're in the us the euro gets stronger than it currently is and the exchange rate changes to € then you will lose out on € 5 if you try to change it back and the opposite is true if the euro gets weaker than it currently is you would gain money on exchanging it back   just look at it as though you 're buying dollars like it were a commodity   if the euro gets stronger it buys more dollars and you should 've held onto it in euros if it gets weaker it buys less dollars and you were better off having it in dollars   you would want to use whichever currency you think will be weaker or gain the least against the dollar while you 're here

summary it 's because you are effectively contributing more money in the second case so you have more money at the end   the effect of being covered by an employer retirement plan in the case of a 401(k that means either you or your employer contributed to it during the year is that it prevents you from deducting traditional ira contributions unless your income is below a very low level for single filing status it phases out at an magi of between $ and $ since you are unable to deduct the traditional ira contribution but you entered that you are still making the full $ 5500 contribution every year that means you are making a non deductible contribution of $ 5500 every year instead of a deductible contribution nondeductible contributions are after tax whereas deductible contributions are pre tax because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of the contribution so you effectively do n't pay income tax on the income you used to contribute $ 1 of pre tax money is not the same as $ 1 of after tax money if your marginal tax rate is 25 then $ 1 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 0.75 of after tax money however since in both cases you are putting in the same nominal amount of contribution $ 5500 but one is pre tax and one is after tax in the after tax case you are effectively contributing more money i.e. more money is taken out from your bank account that year the $ 5500 pre tax contribution is equivalent to only $ 5500 0.75 = $ after tax i.e. you are only short $ from your bank account at the end of the year after making a $ 5500 deductible contribution whereas you are short $ 5500 after making a $ 5500 non deductible contribution so it 's not a fair comparison the non deductible traditional ira contributions are not taxed when withdrawn though the earnings earned from those contributions are still taxed so that 's why you are left with a greater amount this is a similar situation to what happens when you try to compare a $ 5500 deductible traditional ira contribution to a $ 5500 roth ira contribution it will look like the roth ira case leaves you with much more money but that 's again because you are effectively contributing more money because the roth ira contribution is after tax so it 's not a fair comparison the roth ira case will produce a much greater advantage than the non deductible traditional ira contribution case because for a roth ira both the contributions and earnings will not be taxed at withdrawal

a lender will look at three things when giving a loan income do you make enough money each month to afford the payments they will subtract from your income any other loans credit card debt student loan debt mortgage they will also figure in your housing costs your collateral for a mortgage the collateral is the house for a car loan it is the car they will only give you a loan to a specific percentage of the value of the collateral your money in the bank is n't collateral but it can serve as a down payment on the loan   your credit score this is a measure of how well you handle credit the longer the history the better using credit wisely is better than not using the credit you have   if you do n't have a credit card get one start with your current bank you have a history with them if they wo n't help you join a credit union another source of car loans is the auto dealer though their rates can be high make sure that the purchase price does n't require a monthly payment too high for your income good rules of thumb for monthly payments are 25 for housing and 10 for all other loans combined even a person with perfect credit ca n't get a loan for more than the bank thinks they can afford note do n't drain all your savings you will need it to pay for the unexpected expenses in life you might think you have enough cash to pay off the student loan or to make a big down payment but you do n't want to stretch yourself too thin

i 'm going to look just at purchase price essentially you ca n't always claim the whole of the purchase price or 95 your case in the year the accounting period of purchase but you get a percentage of the value of the car each year called writing down allowance which is a capital allowance it is similar to depreciation but based on 's own formula in fact it seems you probably can claim 95 of the purchase price because the value is less than £ 1000 the logic is a bit involved but i hope you can understand it you could also claim simplified expenses instead which is just based on a rate per mile but you ca n't claim both note by year i mean whatever your account period is this could be the normal financial year but you would probably have a better idea about this see the hmrc webpage on this for more details   the big idea is that you record the value of any assets you are claiming writing down allowance on in one of a number of pools that attract the same rate of writing down allowance so you do n't need to record the value of each asset separately they are similar to accounts in accounting so they have an opening balance and closing balance if you use an asset for personal use it needs a pool to itself call that a single asset pool so to start with look at the business cars section and look at the rates for cars section to determine the rate you can claim each one links to a further article which gives more detail if you need it your car is almost certainly in the special rate category special rate is 8 a year main rate is 18 and first year allowance is essentially 100 then you look at the work out what you can claim article that talks you through the steps i 'll go through your example you would have a pool for your car which would end the account period before you bought the vehicle at zero step 1 you then add the value of the car in the period you bought it step 2 you would reduce the value of the pool if you dispose of it in the same year step 3 because the car is worth less than £ 1,000 see the section on if you have £ 1,000 or less in your pool you would normally be able to claim the whole value of the pool the value of the car in the first accounting period and reduce the value of the pool to zero as you use the car for personal use you only claim 95 of the value but still reduce the pool to zero see the section on items you use outside your business this £ 1000 is adjusted if your accounting period lasts more or less than 12 months once the pool is down to zero that it you do n't need to think about it any more for tax purposes apart from if you are claiming other expenses or if you sell it   it gets more complicated if the car is more expensive i 'll go through an example for a car worth £ 2,000   then after step 3 on the year of purchase you would reduce the value of the pool by 8 and claim 95 of the reduction this would be a 160 reduction and = 152 claim leaving the value of 1860 in the pool you then follow the same steps for the next year start with in the pool reduce the value by 8 then claim 95 of the reduction this continues until you sell or dispose of the car step 3 or the value of the pool is 1000 or less then you claim all of it in that year selling the car or disposing of the car is discussed in the   capital allowances when you sell an asset article the basic idea is that if you have already reduced the value of the pool to zero the price you sell the car for is added you your profits for that year see if you originally claimed 100 of the item if you still have anything in the pool you reduce the value of the pool by the sale value and if it reduces to below zero to say you add that amount £ 200 in this case to your profits if the value is above zero you keep applying writing down allowances in your case that seems to just means if you sell the car in the same year you buy it you claim the difference or 95 of it as writing down allowance and if you do it later you claim the purchase price in the year of purchase and add 95 of the sale price to your profits in the year you sell it i 'm a bit unclear about starting to use it outside your business which does n't seem to apply if you use it outside the business to start with    you can claim simplified expenses for vehicles if you are a sole trader or partner but not if you claim capital allowances such as writing down allowances on them or you include a separate expense in your accounts for expenses it 's a flat rate of a mile for the first 10,000 miles and per mile after that for cars and a mile for motorcycles see the page on mileage expenses for details for any vehicle you decide to either claim capital allowances claim running costs separately or claim simplified mileage expenses and once you use the flat rates for a vehicle you must continue to do so as long as you use that vehicle for your have to stick with that decision for that vehicle   in your case it seems you can claim 95 of the purchase price in the accounting period you buy it and if you sell it you add 95 of the sale price to your profits in that accounting period it gets more complicated if you have a car worth more than £ 1000 adjusted for the length of the accounting period also if you change how you use it consult the page on selling selling an asset as you may have disposed of it you can also use simplified mileage expenses but then you ca n't claim capital allowances or claim running costs separately for that car i hope that makes sense please comment if not and i 'll try to adjust the explanation

my question is how is this new value determined   does it go off of    the tax appraised value the tax assessors values are based on broad averages and are not very useful in determining actual home value the most defensible valuation outside of a sale is a professional appraisal real estate agents may or may not give you reasonable estimates but their opinions are less valuable than that of a professional appraiser additionally agents hoping to land you as a client even if you tell them you 're not trying to sell could be motivated to over estimate in many instances a few opinions from agents will be good enough but if there is any contention a professional appraisal will be better should you prior to your death get an independent appraiser to    appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the    properties value with the will or something the real estate market fluctuates too much to make having an appraisal done prior to your death a practical approach in most circumstances you could make arrangements so that an appraisal would be scheduled after your death here 's a good resource on the topic estimating the value of inherited real estate

quid 's answer explains the settlement period well however it should be noted that you can avoid the settlement period by opening a margin account any specific broker like schwab may or may not offer margin accounts margin accounts allow you to borrow money to avoid the settlement period or to buy more securities than you can actually afford note that if you buy more securities than you can afford using margin you expose yourself to losses potentially larger than your initial investment if you fund your account with $ 50,000 and use margin to purchase $ 80,000 of stock which then drops in value by 80 you will have lost $ and owe the broker $ 14,000 plus fees

dividends are normally paid in cash so do n't generally affect your portfolio aside from a slight increase to cash   you get a check for them or your broker would deposit the funds into a money market account for you   there is sometimes an option to re invest dividends see 's answer regarding dividend re investment plans as tom au described the dividends are set by the board of directors and announced   also as he indicated just before the record date a stock which pays dividends is worth slightly more reflecting the value of the dividend that will be paid to anyone holding the stock on the record date and goes down by the dividend amount immediately after that date since you 'd now have to hold the stock till the next record date to get a dividend   in general unless there 's a big change in the landscape such as in late 2008 most companies pay out about the same dividend each time and changes to this are sometimes seen by some as indicators of company health and such news can result in movement in the stock price when you look at a basic quote on a ticker symbol there is usually a line for div yeild which gives the amount of dividend paid per share and the relative yeild as a percentage of the stock price   if a company has been paying dividends this field will have values in it if a company does not pay a dividend it will be blank or say na depending on where you get the quote   this is the easiest way to see if a company pays a dividend or not   for example if you look at this quote for google you can see it pays no dividend   now in terms of telling when and how much of a dividend has been paid most financial sites have the option when viewing a stock chart to show the dividend payments   if you expand the chart to show at least a year you can see when and how much was paid in terms of dividends   for example you can see from this chart that msft pays dividends once a quarter and used to pay out 13 cents but recently changed to 16 cents    if you were to float your mouse over one of those icons it would also give the date the dividend was paid

usually when a company is performing well both its share price and its dividends will increase over the medium to long term similarly if the company is performing badly both the share price and dividends will fall over time if you want to invest in higher dividend stocks over the medium term you should look for companies that are performing well fundamentally and technically choose companies that are increasing earnings and dividends year after year and with earnings per share greater than dividends per share choose companies with share prices increasing over time uptrending then once you have purchased your portfolio of high dividend stocks place a trailing stop loss on them for a timeframe of 1 to 3 years i would choose a trailing stop loss of 20 this means that if the share price continues going up you keep benefiting from the dividends and increasing share price but if the share price drops by 20 below the recent high then you get automatically taken out of that stock leaving your emotions out of it this will ensure your capital is protected over your investment timeframe and that you will profit from both capital growth and rising dividends from your portfolio

i very much agree with what eh bacon said about townhouses but wanted to add a bit about hoa 's renting after moving on and appreciation hoa 's hoa 's can be restrictive but they can also help protect property values not all hoa 's are created equal some mean you have zero exterior maintenance some do n't you 'll be able to review the hoa financials to see where the money goes and if they have healthy reserves you 'll see how much they spend on administration i think ~10 is typical and administration can be offset by the savings associated with doing everything in bulk a well run hoa should actually save you money over paying for all the things separately but many people are happy to do some things themselves rather than pay for it and would come out ahead if they did n't have an hoa and of course not all hoa 's are well run just do your best to get informed transitioning to rental if you are interested in trying your hand being a landlord after living there for a while a townhouse typically exposes you to less rental risk than a single family home because the cost is typically lower and if the hoa maintains everything outside the house then you do n't have to worry as much about tenants keeping a lawn in good shape for example appreciation appreciation varies wildly by market some research by suggests in general condo 's have outperformed single family houses over the last 5 years by 10.5 the same article notes that others disagree with 's assessment and put condo 's below single family houses by 1.3 annually my first townhouse has appreciated 41 over the last 3 years while houses in the area are closer to 30 over the same period but i believe that 's a function of my local market more than a nationwide trend i would n't plan around any appreciation forecasts source condos may be appreciating faster than single family houses my have to do your research on each potential property regardless of whether it 's a condo townhouse single family to find out what restrictions there are and what services are provided by the hoa if any your agent should be provided with most of the pertinent info and you may not get to see hoa financials until you 're under contract most importantly in my view i would n't buy anywhere near the top of your budget being house poor is no fun and will limit your options do n't count on appreciation or better income in the future to justify stretching yourself thin in the short term

here so i 'll respond with what i ended up doing at the end of each month i download transaction data from each of stripe and paypal   for each i do the following so it is just six entries in wave per month plus a little spreadsheet manipulation to determine revenues and fees   takes about 10 minutes to do this i really dislike wave 's automatic integration with paypal   it creates a lot of entries and it also does n't seem reliable so it is easy for transactions to get lost

this is basically what financial advisers have been saying for years that you should invest in higher risk securities when you are young and lower risk securities when you get older however despite the fact that this is taken as truth by so many financial professionals financial economists have been unable to formulate a coherent theory that supports it   by changing the preferences of their theoretical investors they can get solutions like putting all your investments in a super safe asset until you get to a minimum survival level for retirement and then investing aggressively and many other solutions   but for none of the typically assumed preferences does investing aggressively when young and becoming more conservative as you near retirement seem to be the solution   i 'm not saying there can be no such preferences but the difficulty in finding them makes me think maybe this idea is not actually correct couple of problems with your intuition that you should think about it 's not clear that things average out over time   if you lose a bunch of money in some asset there 's no reason to think that by holding that asset for a while you will make back what you lost prices are not cyclical   moreover does n't your intuition implicitly suggest that you should transition out of risky securities as you get older perhaps after having lost money you can invest in safe assets or even better the portfolio from your graph and then lever up if you do want higher risk return   you do n't need to change your allocation to risky assets and it is suboptimal to do so you want to move along the cal not the curve the riskiness of your portfolio should generally coincide negatively with your risk aversion   when you are older and more certain about your life expectancy and your assets are you exposed to more or less risks   in many cases less risks   this means you would choose a more risky portfolio because you are more sure you will have enough to live on until death even if your portfolio takes a dive your actual portfolio consists both of your investments and your human capital the present value of your time and skills   when you are young the value of this capital changes significantly with market performance so you already have background risk   buying risky securities adds to that risk   when you are old your human capital is worth little so your overall portfolio becomes less risky   you might want to compensate by increasing the risk of your investments edit note that this point may depend on how risky your human capital is how likely it is that your wage or job prospects will change with the economy overall the answer to your question is not definitively known but there is theoretical evidence that investing in risky securities when young is n't optimal having said that most people do seem to invest in riskier securities when young and safer when they are older i suspect this is because with life experience people become less optimistic as they get older not because it is optimal to do so   but i ca n't be sure

sort of   i mean that even though tv generally sucks and there are better alternatives the average human may not be smart enough to care   tv is easy something they 're used to and requires no energy to watch or make any changes   so they may eventually catch on but the tv industry will probably be able to stay a step or two ahead of them simply because it 's not too hard to do and nothing will happen too fast   i learned about investing back in the dot com days   i invested too heavily in high tech thinking it was really happening and i was somewhat right but it just did n't happen as quickly as we all thought and a lot of companies went broke because they had no short term income or plan and ran out of capital   now i know there 's more to it than simply knowing which way the wind blows   you also need to know about and hurricanes so to speak   timing is important and shorting stocks can be profitable unless it takes too long and you end up being forced to act before you 're ready

as mentioned in several other answers the main reason for high rates is to maximize profit however here is another smaller effect the typical flow of getting money from an atm suppose you have a minute to consider the offer then in that time the currency may drop or rise which you can see from an external source of information therefore this opens a window for abuse for real major currencies these huge switches are rare but they do happen and when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common just looking at a random pair for today to i immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 this may not be the best example but it shows why a large margin is desirable note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be for cases where it is calculated afterwards i have not found any valid excuse for such large margins except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

i just graduated from college and i am already planning my retirement    in terms of money sitting in my bank account post retirement assuming ii have    $ 250,000 what is the highest interest that i can earn with it   assuming you are 22 and will retire in 45 years at age 67 there is no way to predict interest rates when i was 22 and just out of college i started putting money into a bank account to save for a down payment the rate for a savings account was 6 that means that every month i made 1/2 of one percent today that same credit union offers a money maker account with a minimum balance of $ 100,000 that pays 0.25 for the year what i made in a month would take two years to make today keep in mind we also ca n't estimate your pay in the last year before retirement or the inflation rate for the next 45 years or the mortgage rate or the availability of social security or the returns of the s&p for 45 years it is great you are starting to think about this today but you will have to keep adjusting parts of your plan as the years go by you may have to factor in children your medical situation   even if the interest rates recover you may not want to put all your post retirement money in the bank most people ca n't sustain the required flow of money for their 30 years of retirement from savings accounts   as for today fdic or similar accounts from credit unions will not have rates approaching 3 it ca n't even approach that 3 rate via multi year cds my credit union has a 6 year cd for almost 2 if the goal of the money is safety then do n't expect to find those high rates now some institutions may offer high rates without that fdic protection but that is risky

they 're probably talking about flipping houses the conventional wisdom when flipping is to purchase the property with a mortgage or other loan on do the work to it get it listed for re sale promptly this step has varying strategies with a profitable price but one that will make it move have the house sold on or before the first payment would be due this is anywhere from 30 to 60 days the flipper then never has to make a payment on the mortgage or loan the costs of the home are recovered promptly potentially before any loan credit card payments or invoices are due and there is a profit this also assumes that either a 100 loan or some other mechanism is used to address closing costs and fees this model fits the premise of the in that you make money investing in real estate but never have to tie up any of your own money in the process

for customer accounts that you have with a merchant normally a positive balance in the account is what you owe the merchant when you have a credit on the account or a negative balance it usually means that it is an amount that the merchant owes you this could be because you paid too much or perhaps it is because the merchant is giving you a refund for some reason   however it is always a possibility that this particular merchant is not using the terminology in the conventional way if you are n't sure the best thing to do is to ask the merchant directly by contacting their customer service department   just judging from the screenshot you posted it looks to me like they owe you some money i suggest you click the statement button it looks like that will generate some type of statement that will instruct the merchant to send you a refund but that is only a guess their customer service should be able to tell you what to do

all investors of equal standing get the same proportion of the net assets on bankruptcy but not all shareholders are of equal standing in general once all liabilities are covered bond holders are paid first as that type of investment is company debt then preferred stock holders are paid out and then common shareholders this is the reason why preferred stock is usually cheaper it is less risky as it has a higher claim to assets and therefore commands a lower risk premium the exact payout schedule is very corporation dependent so needs research on a per firm basis

that depends on where how you 're charging a model 3 with a battery will take less time to charge than a 75kwh battery    supercharger charges at so the charge times would be    = hours = 27.5 minutes   75kwh = hours = minutes   the appeal of an ev though is charging at home if a user has a 14 50 installed that does maximum it offers of charging so    = 6.25 hours    75kwh = hours   other options exist for charging at home such as the high power wall charger could do or    = hours    75kwh = hours   the time to charge issue is more relevant for road trips since the the average driver does less than 200 miles per day and their car spends more time at home potentially plugged into a charger than driving i have a battery in my tesla and it 's nice to know that i could drive it to empty and then charge back up fully once i get home better yet it will charge completely to full in about the amount of time i should be sleeping at home    the range anxiety is closely tied to the charging concerns and with the tesla supercharger network doubling by year 's end and continuing to grow both tesla 's charging network as well as other plug in options like blink ev go etc charging is less of a gamble and more of just simple planning apps like allow you to see crowd sourced reports of ev plugs what types they use type of charging available cost availability and more you can plan your drive to use superchargers on the road and then plan your destination or evening stop in a place with charging capability i think it 's only a matter of time before destination chargers develop a system like what tesla does at many superchargers otherwise by the end of 2017 you should never be too far from a supercharger an ev charging station or even some kind individual who will lend you some juice to get you where you 're going

you do n't seem to have any particular question to be answered your understanding of rrsps seems to be very good   have you considered whether you might be better off putting your retirement savings into a tfsa instead both types can protect your growth from taxation provided you reinvest the refund from the rrsp the main way in which the rrsp is better than tfsa is that you can pay the tax on the contribution at a time when your income is lower and thus have a lower marginal tax rate most people retire with a lower income than during their earning years but it 's a matter of tax brackets if you think you 'll be in the same bracket same marginal tax rate when you retire then the tfsa and rrsp work out even in that regard so in your case the question you want to ask yourself is when i retire will i have an income including cpp oas pension payments etc that exceeds $ worth of today 's dollars if so your rrsp holds no advantage over the tfsa in fact the rrsp may even be worse since the withdrawals count as income and reduce the amount of oas and perhaps payments that the government gives you at least under current regulations if you 're unsure i suggest you try this calculator from that runs both scenarios and helps you see which one is more beneficial it even factors in the oas

for any corporate or commercial event to be a success it is necessary that hosting of the same is done in a proper manner and apart from hosting the event should also be documented too for doing so you will need assistance of professional photographers who are skilled and experts enough to be able to cover the big event in a systematic way

once your sister and you make your first payments you 've paid $ and your sister has paid $ 1400 but your sister also owes rent order estimate for rent is that it 's equal to mortgage payment so that 's $ 2045 i assume that $ 2045 is actually your total payment not just your escrow payment unless i 'm misunderstanding what the term means $ 2045 is an absurdly high amount for a monthly escrow payment so your sister now has made a net capital contribution of negative $ 645 so you 're giving your sister a gift of $ each year and are the sole equity owner of the house there 's a $ gift tax exclusion and i think that both you and your husband can claim it separately so every year you could declare your sister to have $ added to her capital contribution or more if you 're willing to pay gift tax but as it stands if there are any losses from the property they will be borne exclusively by you therefore any profits should be enjoyed exclusively by you any other arrangement is you giving a gift to your sister if the price of the house were to shoot up to $ 1,000,000 after a year and you were to split the profits with your sister 50:50 and not pay a gift tax you would be violating tax law

its less about retail investors and more about the large institutions harvard 's endowment for example is held in trust so is the endowment for every university charity and foundation    in terms of retail investors its probably much less than 50 its just that the massive amount of wealth in the wealthiest people tips the balance drastically    the top 20 wealthiest people in the world have all of their assets in trust they probably do nt have much personal ownership in anything and they hold more money than almost everyone else combined

as an alternative to investing you 'll find at least some banks eg that will give you preferential interest 0.1 though just for opening a free brokering account as this is still your individual savings account your money is as safe as it was before opening your account i certainly would n't buy to hold any stock or fund that is linked to the nikkei right now income stocks outside of the 225 may be safer but you 'd still need to buy enough of them that their individual results do n't affect your bottom line

i 've considered simply moving my funds to an australian bank to lock in the current rate but i worry that this will put me at risk of a substantial loss due to exchange rates transfer fees etc when i move my funds back into the us in 6 months   why move funds back   if you want to lock in current exchange rates figure out how much money you are likely to spend in australia for the next six months   move just enough funds to cover that to an australian bank   leave the remainder in the united states us as your future expenses will be in us dollars    so long as you do n't find some major unanticipated purchase this covers you   you have enough money for the next six months with no exchange rate worries    at the end of the six months if you fall slightly short cover with your credit card as you are doing now   you 'll take a loss but on a small amount of money   if you have a slight excess and you were right about the exchange rate you 'll make a little profit at the end   if you were wrong you 'll take a small loss    the key here is that you should be able to budget for your six months   you can lock in current exchange rates just for that amount of money    moving all your funds to australia is a gamble   you can certainly do that if you want but rather than gambling it may be better to take the sure thing   you know you need six months expenses so just move that   you will definitely be spending six months money in australia so you are immune to exchange rate fluctuations for that period   the remainder of your money can stay in the us as that 's where you plan to spend it    however recent political events back in the states have me and i 'm sure every currency speculator and foreign investor worried that this advantage will not last for much longer   if currency speculators expect exchange rates to fall then they 'd have already bid down the rates   i.e. they 'd keep speculating until the rates did fall   so the speculators expect the current rates are correct otherwise they 'd move them    donald trump 's state goal is to increase exports relative to imports   if he 's successful this could cause the us dollar to fall to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive   however if his policies fail then the opposite is likely to happen   most of his announced trade policies are more likely to increase the value of the dollar than to decrease it   in particular that is the likely result of increased tariffs    if you are worried about trump failing then you should worry about a strong dollar   that 's more in line with actual speculation since the election    i do n't know that i 'd make a strong bet in either direction   hedging makes more sense to me as it simply locks in the current situation which you apparently find favorable   not hedging at all might produce some profit if the dollar goes up   gambling all your funds might produce some profit if the dollar goes down   the middle path of hedging just what you 're spending is the safest if least likely to produce profit    my recommendation is to hedge the six months expenses and enjoy your time abroad   why worry about political events that you ca n't control   enjoy your working studying vacation

nothing wrong with the other answers but here 's a trick to hopefully make it totally transparent    imagine that you 're not the one implementing this business plan but someone else is   let 's call this other person your asset manager   so on the first day you give your asset manager $ 9   he takes this and generates $ 1 profit from it recovering the $ 9 which he then reinvests to generate $ 1 profit every day   from your perspective you just gave him $ 9   at the end of the year he gives you $ 365 in addition to your original investment of $ 9 in real life he 'd take the fees of course or perhaps he 's been lending out the money he 's been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services   so your return on investment is 365 9 100 > 4000 as claimed by your source

i guess it depends where you are that would make sense i 'm always stunned by the amount of latinos eating in chipotle though in ca i know where all the burrito places are not far and i 'm wondering what 's going through their heads paying more for sub par rice filled burritos    given the shockingly high hispanic percentage in chicago it 's interesting to see you do n't see the same trend my guess is the chipotles you 're are n't in the more hispanic parts of town most of the parts of la i 'm talking are hispanic and so those are the customers in an area where you can walk for days and not see a white person in a car unless you 're near a whole foods it makes sense that i 'm not seeing them at the local chipotle   rick is n't just good for he 's good period though i do n't know i thought his main restaurant had a different name i love that one of his places is now in lucky lucky chicago has the best food in america

while this question is old and i generally agree with the answers given i think there 's another angle that needs a little insurance if you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed   your lender will require you to carry full comprehensive collision liability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible   while the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled   these long term car loans i 've seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs there is more to this decision than the interest calculation    obviously if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably you 'll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience   but while the loan is outstanding there are costs beyond interest to consider

unfortunately economics and accounting for that matter wo n't help much with being an entrepreneur   the main thing you need to focus on is cash generation you need to maximise this there are 2 aspects revenue and costs   you need to plot these over the last 5 10 years to see trends   what is happening to revenues are they growing with inflation   if not why not   is it because people are buying online   is it because the products are not fashionable is it because people simply buy less jewelry these days   have the cost of the products gone up but the shop has n't increased prices i.e. gross margin contraction   decreasing gross margin could also be an indicator that someone is stealing from the business    what about the overhead costs of running the business   what has happened to rent salaries insurance   look for any unusual trends     in summary first you need to identify where the problem is and to do this you need to look at the trends of revenues and costs break costs down into categories

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

gt that there are more jobs today is n't a convincing argument   you yourself said that automation means there is a net loss in jobs   if that were true there would be less jobs now than in 1900   but the opposite is true   products are more efficiently reaching the consumer   this means more people are buying more things   this means producers have to hire more people or buy more raw materials   lets go with a real classic example   lets say that you and myself make sewing needles   we both do it by hand because in this example we are at the dawn of the industrial revolution making a needle at a time   now lets say i figure out a way to make a machine that makes 100 needles in the time it took me to make 1 and because less of my time is going into each needle i can sell them cheaper   i am now able to reach more stores than before to sell my sewing needles   i have to hire some more people to make deliveries because i can only do so much by myself   now i also grow to the point of having to buy another machine because my business is booming   people love my sewing needles   but i ca n't man 2 machines so i hire in another person   now i have more people making deliveries and i no longer deliver myself because i am better at making needles than delivering them   the guys supplying me with the metal to make the needles also had to hire some people to keep up with my demand   and the people mining the metal for my needles also had to hire another miner   this may sound like a made up story but this sort of thing was going on at this time     the argument that automation kills jobs has been around since before the industrial revolution   how much would your cell phone be if we were still using horse and cart to deliver goods   would your mother sister girlfriend wife yourself if you are a girl be able to have a full time job if they did not have a washing machine iron vacuum cleaner other appliances   what kind of selection in the grocery store would you have if the tractor was never used

i 'm not sure what rents you are talking about but corporate profits are completely different from high net worth individuals and actually most corporate profits are reinvested literally or returned to investors many of whom are less than rich or are institutional investors like pension funds or investment funds who in turn provide those profits to their beneficiaries    if you are suggesting that the financial industry somehow contributes nothing to society then you must lack an understanding of the importance of liquidity to a modern economy for an example of what happens when liquidity dries up look no further than 2008 or greece today    if you want your cell phone ipad internet etc then you need a financial system because there is no way a company like apple is getting enough funding to undertake massive projects like the ipod or iphone without major multi national banks who can provide the leverage to make it possible though apple is an poor example of this as they are now so wildly successful that they have a huge pile of cash that they actually are hording then again look at the investor outcry that the apple horde as i said it 's bad business to stockpile cash and the investors let apple know this so apple distributed that cash back to investors in the form of a dividend much of apple stock is owned by and they all now have a sweet check for thousands of dollars on average in their mailbox due to evil corporate america

would you want to work in an environment where your pay drops significantly if a large client leaves you do nothing wrong the client goes bankrupt and you 're assigned the work of smaller accounts to fill out your work week but you 're making 15 less despite being more experienced than the year before and doing a great job   whoever is handling assignments would be granted an obscene amount of power within the organisation how do accounts get shuffled fairly are people assigned permanently or do they get shuffled around to even things out   in short your idea could be very good for the company but terrible for the employees innovation would stagnate or be kept to each employee in the hopes of gaining an edge office politics would increase and the environment could turn toxic quickly turnover would probably increase as well

most etfs are index funds meaning you get built in diversification so that any one stock going down wo n't hurt the overall performance much you can also get essentially the same index funds by directly purchasing them from the mutual fund company to buy an etf you need a brokerage account and have to pay a transaction fee buying only $ 1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money you want to keep such fees way down below 0.1 pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios   or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company this generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up if you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging no matter what kind of account you are using keep doing that even if the market values are going down especially if the market values are going down   if you can keep doing this then forget about certificates of deposit at current rates you can not build wealth with cds
