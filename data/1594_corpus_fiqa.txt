the easiest route for you to go down will be to consult wikipedia which will provide a comprehensive list of all us stock exchanges there are plenty more than the ones you list then visit the websites for those that are of interest to you where you will find a list of holiday dates along with the trading schedule for specific products and the settlement dates where relevant in answer to the other part of your question yes a stock can trade on multiple exchanges typically unless you instruct otherwise your broker will route your order to the exchange where it can be matched at the most favorable price to you at that time

enough funds to run the business and pay yourself the first year plus 30   gt;this is going to vary wildly depending on the particular business so much so that a rule of thumb would be impossible to define   absolutely   one of the things that varies widely is what amount constitutes the pay yourself the first year which will fall anywhere on a wide spectrum from the low end that is essentially below poverty level someone young used to living as we to say like a college student needing only enough to cover a minimal survival to someone who has ridiculously extravagant needs married with a family mcmansion mortgage and multiple new status vehicles etc that they expect to maintain and then the additional 30 grows in proportion on top of that subjective base figure   i wrote used to say because we are talking about back in the day when living like a college student meant minimalist bare bones needs akin to a life a shared small dorm boarding house room with minimal furniture no partying zero amenities certainly no water parks with lazy rivers no food courts etc nothing like most us colleges and universities have today

in the united states you ca n't because the average millennial in the united states has no opportunity to save money either you get a college education then you will be burdened with a student loan the cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades it is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents or you skip college but college is the only way in the united states to obtain a generally accepted qualification so you wo n't get any job which pays enough to save any money as soon as that student loan is paid off you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades as soon as the house debt is paid off you will be old and develop some medical problems the medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again so when in their life are millennials supposed to save money

what you are suggesting will not work banks have strict guidelines about what they can and can not do with an fha loan property remember the fha is only an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan   the bank wo n't take the risk of violating their insurance policy and the government refusing to pay them off if you default instead consider doing a creative sale on your property maybe a rent to own deal or owner financing as long as you pay the mortgage the bank wo n't even know you do n't live there and you can rent the house out to someone who eventually will buy it after the timeframe expires meanwhile you can go and get a new home or condo either thru regular financing or owner the internet to see how to do this and you can use owner financing until you complete the sale of the first house otherwise just tough it out in the house you are in until the time expires and then sell you made no mention of the property value but i am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity note that if you sell at that time though you will likely have to come out of cash because your equity wo n't cover the realtor fee and closing cost but if you do the rent to own i suggested earlier you can sell at a slightly higher price making sure you can cover those cost i realize this answer is a little out the box but i deal with people who do n't want properties all day and i have completed transactions like this many times good luck and god bless

for some people it 's easier to stick to a budget if they have separate checking and savings accounts because they can deposit funds directly into their savings account and not have those funds accessible by debit credit card checks etc this allows people to pay themselves first and accumulate savings while making it slightly more difficult to spend those savings on a whim one a more technical legal note one key difference in the united states comes from regulation d. of the law limits you to six withdrawals from savings and money market accounts no such limit exists for checking accounts regulation d also forbids banks from paying interest on business checking accounts   in the simplest case checking accounts and savings accounts are a tradeoff between liquidity and return checking accounts are much more liquid but wo n't necessarily earn interest while savings accounts are less liquid because of the withdrawal limits but earn interest nowadays however sweep accounts blur this line somewhat because they function like checking accounts in that you can write an unlimited number of checks make an unlimited number of withdrawals etc but you can also earn interest on your account balance because some or all of the funds are swept into an investment account when not in use the definition of in use can vary from business to business and bank to bank

so like any market the housing market will on average trend upward but the extreme prices we 're seeing in toronto or san francisco are not part of the normal market growth there 's a lot of factors that can affect housing outside of just increased demand here 's a few of the big ones   1 low interest rates since 2008 i think interests rates have been really low meaning mortgages are really low if you can borrow money at 4 and the inflation rate is 8 you 've borrowed expensive dollars and are paying back in cheap dollars   not in my back yard if you have enough land to build 10 houses or one 100 apartment building what do you build theoretically the apartment building but in reality the people that already paid for their million dollar house do n't want a giant apartment complex bringing down the value of the neighborhood and ruining their views so they pass laws preventing new and bigger buildings meaning higher prices for the homes that already exist and as a bonus it 's easier on the city to have 10 people who make a million dollars a year than a 100 people who make 100,000 a year   foreign investment so there 's a lot of places where people have money but because of corruption or shaky economies it 's not safe to hold it there so you buy properties in the u.s. or canada because you know no one 's going to seize it and it 's generally not going to lose value so you end up with foreign dollars competing with the local markets for housing driving the price up

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

hopefully this $ 1000 is just a start and not the last investment you will ever make assuming that there are a couple of big questions to consider one what are you saving for are you thinking that this is for retirement 40 or 50 years from now or something much sooner like buying a car or a house you did n't say where you live in the u.s. if you put money into an ira or a 401k or some other account that the government classes as a retirement account you do n't pay taxes on the profits from the investment only on the original principal if you leave the money invested for a long period of time the profits can be many times the original investment so this makes a huge difference   like suppose that you pay 15 of your income in state and local taxes   and suppose you invest your $ 1000 in something that gives a 7 annual return and leave it there for 40 years of course i 'm just making up numbers for an example but i think these are in a plausible range and i 'm ignoring the difference between regular income tax and capital gains tax etc etc it does n't change the point if you put the money in a classic ira you pay 0 taxes the year you open the account so you have your full $ 1000 figure that compound interest for 40 years you 'll end up with crunch crunch crunch the numbers $ then you pay 15 when you take it leaving you with $ the end result with a roth ira is exactly the same feel free to crunch those numbers but now suppose you invest in a no retirement account so you have to pay taxes every year your original investment is only $ 850 because you have to pay tax on that and your effective return is only because you have to pay 15 of the 7 so after 40 years you have crunch crunch $ quite a difference but if you put money in a retirement account and then take it out before you retire you pay substantial penalties i think it 's 20 if you plan to take the money out after a year or two   that would really hurt two how much risk are you willing to take the reality of investment is that almost always the more risk you take the bigger the potential returns and vice versa investments that are very safe tend to have very low returns as you 're young if you 're saving for retirement you can probably afford a fairly high amount of risk if you lose a lot of money this year odds are you 'll get it back over the next few years or at least be able to put more money into investments to make up for it if you 're 64 and planning to retire next year you want to take very low risk investments in general investing in government bonds is very safe but has very low returns corporate bonds are less safe but offer higher returns stocks are a little more of course different companies have different levels of risk new start ups tend to be very risky but can give huge returns commodities are much higher risk buying on margin or selling short are ways to really leverage your money but you could end up losing more than you invested mutual funds are a relatively safe way to invest in stocks and bonds because they spread your risk over many companies three how much effort are you willing to put into managing your investments how much do you know about the stock market and the commodities market and international finance and so on and how much are you willing to learn if your answer is that you know a lot about these things or are willing to dive in and learn a lot that you can invest in individual stocks bonds commodities etc if your answer is that you really do n't know much about all this then it makes a lot of sense to just put your money into a mutual fund and let the people who manage the fund do all the work

as a general proposition no you do not need to report money transfers into the us   if a transaction exceeds $ 10,000 then the bank must report it anyway   note that structuring your transactions to avoid a $ 10,000 deposit is illegal so be careful if you are moving lots of money as a general rule no transferring your own individual money from a foreign account to a us account does not incur taxes only lawyers are authorized to practice law in the us   they should generally be bar licensed in the state of practice   certified public accountants can assist you with tax preparation and return positions though tax lawyers may be necessary for some situations or for formal tax opinions   be sure to use an experienced advisor to file your tax returns and information reporting

i agree and admit that i probably assumed a bit too much context   group exists for a specific hateful purpose whereas a country does not   i agree but paypal is into taking highly publicized regional action based on social and political issues for example consider the transgender bathroom rights issue taking place in north carolina last year not even close to every resident of the state supported it yet paypal made state level decisions based on it such as their choice   to pull out of plans for a new global headquarters in charlotte nc see here     if all residents in arabia do n't believe in discrimination and therefore paypal does n't exclude business with the country as a whole then all residents of nc not agreeing with another form of discrimination should n't exclude business from nc as a whole yet it did   the difference paypal is n't going to lose a recurring amount of money by moving their operations to a different state especially when they have n't really laid down too much sunk cost of payment processing on the other hand would have had an impact on their bottom line    they like to flex their political and social opinion but seem to be very cost effective in how they choose to do so i respect them for taking initiative to use their influence to impact the world in a way they see most fit but i also believe that many people over applaud or over blame them paypal is n't risking business for causes in the same way that a soldier might risk their life for a cause they're only risking their reputation like a politician might in openly supporting or opposing a war

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

your bank lloyds sent the australian bank $ 500 aud having converted $ gbp at a rate of aud per gbp which was slightly less than the published rate which normally applies to transfers measured in hundred thousands if not   millions of pounds   using the published rate amounts to an fee of 11 aud which you are not complaining about   you also paid a fee to lloyds of 20 gbp which you disclosed after i had posted this answer the australian bank refused to accept the payment because the account to which the money had to be deposited was closed   perhaps instead of just sending back $ 500 aud it converted the amount to gbp less its fee of what i suspect is $ 60 aud and sent it back   notice that the bank rate of aud per gbp says that gbp is what you get from a tad over   $ 440 aud and so perhaps st george 's charged you a $ 60 aud fee for the conversion while converting the rest $ 440 aud to gbp or maybe lloyds   got $ 500 aud from st and charged you a $ 60 aud fee for converting it to gbp regardless of who did the   conversion it is also possible that the rate you got not   quite as good as the published rate corresponds to $ 450 aud converting to gbp and a $ 50 aud fee for the conversion    you said i was told by lloyds tsb that st. would n't levy any charges as they would be paid a separate agent 's fee this might have been told to you as st. will not be any charges if you send $ 500 aud for deposit to the account in australia and your payee will get exactly $ 500 aud if you pay us gbp plus 20 gbp as our conversion fee today if you want to send gbp instead we can not tell you how much to send   because st. george 's will levy a charge for conversion to aud and the conversion will be at the rate then prevailing so your payee may receive more or less than $ 500 aud perhaps wanting to send exactly $ 500 aud you chose to pay lloyds tsb and send aud but since the account was closed the money came back and so you ended up paying yet another conversion fee the questions are who charged the second fee as muro said in a comment it should be listed somewhere on the itemized statement and is it a reasonable charge i think $ 50 or $ 60 aud is excessive but then i am not a bank and maybe that is what their standard minimum charge is as i said in my comment the charge is usually a percentage of the amount transferred subject to a minimum levy that the bank sets

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

budgeting is a tool for planning not for execution it sounds like you do n't have a problem budgeting planning what to spend on what things but rather with the execution of your plan that is living frugally this is primarily an issue of self control and personal psychology not an issue with the mechanics of budgeting and finance which explains why the most popular personal finance gurus dave ramsey suze deal as much with your relationship to money and spending as they do with financial knowledge there is no easy answer here but you can learn to spend less one helpful thought is to realize that whatever your current income is someone in your community is currently making less than that and surviving what would you do differently if your real actual income was $ 100 or $ 200 less than it is currently if your food budget is a concern learn to cook cheaply often this is more healthy you mentioned schooling so i assume you are on or near a college campus many colleges have all sorts of free food opportunities i used to eat free vegetarian meals weekly at a temple price of admission listening to the monk read from the fast food is of course a complete no no on low budget living it probably goes without saying but just in case you have n't cancel cable get a cheap phone plan is excellent if available in your area and otherwise see how you can squeeze a few dollars out of your bills on the subject of frugality i have found no book more enlightening than money secrets of the amish finding true abundance in simplicity sharing and saving

your retirement plan should n't necessarily be dictated by your perceived employment risks if you 're feeling insecure about your short term job longevity and mid career prospects you will likely benefit from a thoughtful and robust emergency fund plan your retirement plan is really designed to fund your life after work so the usual advice to contribute as much as you can as early as you can applies either way while a well funded retirement portfolio will help you feel generally more secure in the long run and worst case can be used earlier a good emergency fund will do more to address your near term concerns both retirement and emergency fund planning are fundamental to a comprehensive personal finance plan this post on stackexchange has some basic info about your retirement options given your spare income you should be able to fully fund an ira and your 401 k every year with some left over check the fees in your 401 k to determine if you really want to fully fund the 401 k past employer matching there are several good answers and info about that here low cost mutual funds are a good choice for starting your ira there is a lot of different advice about emergency funds check here ranging from x months salary in savings to detailed planning for each of your expenses regardless of which method you chose it is important to think about your personal risk tolerance and create a plan that addresses your personal needs it 's difficult to live life and perform well at work if you 're always worried about your situation a good emergency plan should go a long way toward those fears your concern about reaching mid life and becoming obsolete or unable to keep up in your career may be premature of course your mind body and your abilities will change over the years but it is very difficult to predict where you will be what you will be doing and whether your experience will offset any potential decrease in your ability to keep up it 's good to think ahead and consider the what ifs but keep in mind that those scenarios are not there is n't anything special about being 40 that will force you into a different line of work if you do n't want to switch

re life insurance multi purpose vehicles generally do n't work as well as just going with single purpose well except for the person company selling them   whole life plans are a great deal for the insurance company and agent not so much for you the easiest way to prove this to yourself is to get the difference in price between a simple term life product that would be appropriate to provide for your family in the event you die   then get the price for a whole life product with the same benefits and what it would be worth after say 20 or 30 years take the difference you would have to pay figure what it would be worth if invested conservatively over the same period figuring in some conservative figure for compound growth such as 6 percent what you could get from a good long term savings bond or index based mutual fund    the last time i did this the pure value of the money alone without any interest was within something like 80 of the value of the whole life policy adding in even a conservative amount of interest turned it into a no brainer the whole life plan was terrible as in investment vehicle   i was far far better off using term life and investing the difference

gt they deprive the us of valuable income which has been earned through infrastructure defense education etc   it does n't the main reason it exists is that the us double dips on taxes the whole point of these inversions is to deal with how the us treats foreign income company still pays us taxes on business done in the us ie using us infrastructure that does n't change if the company is head in the us then the us expects the company to also pay taxes on foreign income ie income that ca n't be referenced back to us infrastructure education etc the company has already paid taxes in the foreign country but the us feels the need to double dip this double dipping is very much a us thing it just makes moral fiscal and logical sense for them to do the inversion the us government should have no rights to overseas money the reason the move to canada is simply that canada like pretty much all capitalist countries does n't tax foreign revenue    you americans really really need to look at your tax system speaking as a canadian business owner who deals with us clients it 's just insane it 's easier to deal with the chinese tax system in my experience

the right way to develop confidence is to get educated confidence can come from many sources but the right source of confidence is an understanding of how markets work markets react and overreact to news i think the biggest factor to trading successfully is to not allow emotion to drive you you should determine how much you are comfortable gaining and losing and set those in limit and stop orders rather than just using market orders all of the time as i 've grown in my understanding of the market i find it much more rare that i feel confident enough to make a specific bet most of my money is allocated in index funds and i only buy and sell small amounts to reset the percentages according to a preset allocation plan i still keep some cash available for speculative trades in the account where those trades will add the most value

the simplest answer to why you ca n't see it in your online statement is a design business decision that was made most probably originally to make online statements differ as little as possible from old fashioned monthly printed statements the old printed statements never showed holds either some banks and card services actually do show these transactions online but in my experience these are the rare exceptions though with business commercial accounts i saw this more but it was still rare this is also partly due to banks fearing lots of annoying phone calls from customers and problems with merchants as people react to hey renting that car did n't cost $ 500 and do n't realize that the hold is often higher than the transaction amount and will be justified in a few days or weeks etc so please do n't dispute the charges just yet behind the scenes i 've had bankers explain it to me thusly the practice has bitten me before and it bothered me a lot so i 've talked to quite a few bankers about this there are two kinds of holds soft holds and hard holds in a soft hold a merchant basically asks the bank hey is there at least $ 75 in this account the bank responds and then has it 's own individually set policy per account type as to how to treat that hold sometimes they reserve no money whatsoever you are free to spend that money right out and rack up nsf fees to your heart 's content yet some policies are to treat this identically to a hard hold and keep the money locked down until released the hard hold is treated very much like an actual expenditure transaction in that the money is locked and shown as no longer available to you this varies by bank some banks use an account balance and an available balance and some have done away with these dual terms and leave it up to you to determine what your balance is and what 's available or you have to call them the key difference in the hard hold and a real expenditure is technically the money is still in your bank account your bank has merely reserved it it for a specific purchase and gently promising the merchant they can have their money later but the biggest difference is there is a time limit if a merchant does not process a completion to the transaction to claim the money your bank will lift the hold after a period of time i 've seen 7 30 days as typical in the us again varying by institution returning your money to your balance that is available for purchasing and withdrawal in every case any vaguely decent banking institution allows you to call them speak to some bank employee and they can look up your account and inform you about the different sort of holds that are on your account that are not pending completed purchase transactions from a strictly cynical perhaps rightly jaded point of view yes this is also used as a method to extort absurdly high fees especially from customers who keep a low balance in their account i have had more than one bank charge nsf fees based on available balances that were due to holds made by gas pumps for instance even though my actual money in my account never went below $ 0 the holds were for amounts larger than the actual transaction and yes the banks usually would waive those fees if you bothered to get someone on the phone or in person and made yourself a nuisance to the right person for long enough but they made you work for it but i digress the reality is that there are lots of back and forth and middle men in transactions like this and most banks try to hide as much of this from you the client as possible partly because its a huge confusing hassle and its part of why you are paying a bank to handle this nonsense for you to start with   and as with all institutions rules and policies become easily adjusted to maximize revenues and if you do n't keep sizable liquid minimum balances 100 of the time all year long they target you for fees   to avoid this without having fat of extra cash in those accounts is use an entirely disconnected credit card for reservations only especially when you are traveling and will be making rentals and booking hotels just tell them you wish to pay with a different card when you are done and most merchants can do this without hassle since it 's a credit card with monthly billing you can often end up with no balance no waiting around for a month for payments to clear and no bank fees it is n't 100 but now i never if i can possibly avoid it use my debit bank card to reserve or rent anything ever

as a person who has had several part time assistants in the past i will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located if you have an assistant personal or business virtual or otherwise and you do n't trust that person with this type of information get a different assistant   an assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else   an assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful that being said there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country however what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong   if you and your virtual assistant are both located in the us you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong   i suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost   if you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings then find someone in the states to do this work   depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a cpa or other licensed bonded professional   yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind as a side note you might even consider finding a local part time assistant this can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think if you can live without someone being bonded   or are willing to pay for the bonding fee yourself   depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified ea or other person that wants some after hours work    if you are in a college town finance accounting or legal majors make great assistants   they will usually work a couple hours a week for beer money they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate   just be prepared to replace them every few years as they move on to real jobs

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

that argument seems pretty false   companies will compete and try to always undercut each other   i have never seen one actual study where prices rose on par when the minimum wage was increased   they of course will increase but it will still be below what is costs now   mainly it takes money from the larger corporations and gives it to the people   i do agree prices will rise but since tons of companies already hire illegals where are we going to be hit   produce will be slightly from stock boys who do nt make that much   for the most part all menial jobs are always using illegal workers

they exceed in rote academics tasks that lend well to memorization   but they lag in areas that require critical thinking and thinking outside the box   there have been a few recent studies on the subject but my google fu is lacking right now   it 's not racial but rather cultural and the effect has to do with the teaching style employed   i imagine it comes from having to memorize 30 50,000 shapes and meanings writing them over and over you spend more time on that and less time being trained to be creative like the western approach   there are advantages and disadvantages to each   and also you have an element of 1st wave immigrant bias involved i do n't think that 's the right term but i remember the basic concept discussed in a couple of my econ courses   the early immigrants to a country tend to be the most self motivated the most skilled   key word here is tend not all but most of the 1st wave are the most entrepreneurial   this is most pronounced in immigration to a new country   once the wave of immigration has become established you get the 2nd and 3rd wave of immigrants come in where those that come in lack the skills of the 1st wave and are able to take advantage of the laid by those who came first

your total debt is equal to your total non credit debt student loans car loans + your total available credit    this is the truth of the low balance fear from lenders that you had heard about your credit utilization is across all of your cards    so if you have two cards both with 15 k limits and one is maxed out and one is empty that is 50 utilization    if you have both cards with 7.5 k balances that is also 50 utilization for the 8 cards that are paid off and still open after you buy a house i 'd close any cards you are n't using   not everyone will agree with this if possible i would close the 8 cards now and pay off the 15 k balance before buying a house   if it 's hard to pay it off now it will be harder when you have a mortgage and home maintenance costs if you want to buy the house before you pay off all of your credit card debt i 'd still close the 8 cards that are already paid off and pay down your last card to 4 k or less to get under 25 utilization the credit rating bureaus do not publish exactly how a different utilization rate of credit will affect your score but it is known that lower utilization will improve your score   fico calls this proportion of credit lines used proportion of balances to total credit limits on certain types of revolving accounts also the longevity of your credit history is based on type of account credit cards car loans etc so if you keep one credit card open you still keep your long history with credit cards on your credit report   fico calls this time since accounts opened by specific type of account

technically the difference between dividends and growth ought to be that dividends can be reinvested in stocks other than the one that paid them which is a definite advantage if you actually have a strategy   dividend stocks used to be preferred for exactly that reason back in the days when fewer people were directly playing in the market and more knew what they were doing unfortunately   getting a periodic dividend from a stock whose price is relatively steady is n't as exciting a game as watching your stock 's value bounce around and hopefully   creep upward on a second by second basis those who are thinking in gambling terms rather than investment terms or who think they can beat the pros at high frequency trading comment withheld want the latter and have been putting a lot of pressure on companies to operate in the latter mode that does n't make it better certainly not for the longer term investors just more fashionable and fashion often means getting stuck with something impractical because everyone else is doing it on this i second scrooge

assets can be acquired in different ways and for different purposes i will only address common legal ways of acquiring assets you can trade one asset for another asset this usually takes place in the form of trading cash or a cash equivalent for an asset the asset received should be of equal or greater value than the asset given in the eyes of the purchaser in order for the trade to be rational take this example i am selling a bike that has been sitting on my porch for a few months it 's worth about $ 25 to me my friend andy comes by and offers $ 90 for it i happily accept andy valued the bike at $ 110 this transaction produced value for both parties i had a value benefit of $ 65 90 25 and andy had a value benefit of $ 20 110 90 you can receive an asset as a gift or an inheritance less common but still frequent someone gives you a gift or a family member dies and you receive an asset you did not own previously you can receive an asset in exchange for a liability when you take out a loan you receive an asset cash which is financed by a liability loan payable in your case why would i buy a mall if having assets worth the same amount as the mall i must value the mall more than the assets i currently have this may stem from the possibility of greater future returns than i am currently making on my asset or if i financed the purchase with a liability greater future returns than the cost associated with payment on the principal and interest of the liability

it is possible that if you do not accept the offer they will try offering you an even lower rate   if they offered you close to 0 you could start carrying a balance and find a better use for the cash you would have spent paying it off there are plenty of investments with a guaranteed return of over 0 personally i am using a 0 offer from one of my cards to invest in the stock market   i might lose that bet but on average over the last 10 years i have not a pretty safe bet would be paying down your mortgage or buying a cd that matures when the offer ends that said even a 10k$ balance might only pay you around is that worth the hassle to you

they all basically mean the same thing a type of debt than can be exchanged for converted into equity at some point it 's only the mechanics that can be different a convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond it usually pays periodic interest and has a face value that 's due at maturity the difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond   there can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond can be converted into   if the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond it 's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert a convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that 's redeemed but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round   rather than specifying a specific number of shares the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market so they both are debt instruments that can turn into equity investments just through different mechanisms a debenture is a fancy word for unsecured debt and convertible debt could be used to described either structure above so those terms could mean either type of structure

yes the interest rate on a treasury does change as market rates change through changes in the price but once you purchase the instrument the rate you get is locked in the cashflows on a treasury are fixed so if the market rate increase the present value of those future cashflows decreases so the price of the treasury decreases if you buy the bond after this happens you would pay a lower price for the same fixed cashflows hence you will receive a higher rate note that once you purchase the treasury instrument your returns are locked in and guaranteed as others have mentioned also note that you should distinguish between treasury bills and treasury bonds which you seem to use interchangeably straight from the horse 's mouth treasury bills are short term securities with maturity up to a year treasury notes are medium term securities with maturity between 1 and 10 years and treasury bonds are anything over 10 years

no that is your implicit return if you hold it to maturity per year that yield is quoted per annum you will receive semi annual payments base on the coupon of whatever off the run 10yr you buy if your coupon is 2 then you will receive $ 10 bi yearly mind you buying a 10 year in this environment will yield a negative real return meaning after inflation over 10 years you will have your entire principal back but inflation adjusted it will have less purchasing power than today meaning there is n't enough yield to make the purchase worth it   also about your upward slope question yes the 30 will yield more than the this is because longer time means more risk will in the future the usa be perceived as near riskless there is also interest rate risk and liquidity risk

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

one where will not be quoted ex is used is when a corporate action is occurring such as a spin off   in such a case the rights to and the spin off itself may be quoted separately on the home country exchange   however if the company is based abroad it may not be worth the expense for them to have an additional securities listing on the local us exchange for example   in november 2016 gold tsx nyse announced it will have an initial public offering of a spin off gold to be listed on tsx as   existing shareholders received a right to one share of the spin off for every 16 shares they held of or   these rights were separately traded in advance of the ipo of the spin off on tsx under but the prospectus they stated that the rights will not be quoted ex on nyse i.e. there was no separate listing on nyse for these rights the wording seems counter intuitive but i suspect that is the attorneys who were preparing the prospectus used those specific words as they may have a very specific meaning e.g. from a statute or previous case

this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

other people have the point that you will get a better rate on a 15 year mortgage typically around 1.25 lower the lower rate makes the 15 year mortgage financially wiser than paying a 30 year mortgage off in 15 years   so go with the 15 year if your income is stable you will never lose your job your appliances never break your vehicles never need major repairs the pipes in your house never burst you and your spouse never get sick and you have no kids or if you do have kids they happen to have good straight teeth they have no aspirations for college do n't play any expensive sports and they will never ask for help paying the rent when they get older and move out   but if any of those things are likely possibilities the 30 year mortgage would give you some flexibility to cover short term cash shortages by reverting to your normal 30 year payment for a month or two now the financially wise may balk at this because you are supposed to have enough cash in reserves to cover stuff like this and that is good advice but how many people struggle to maintain those reserves when they buy a new house   consider putting together spreadsheet and calculating the interest cost difference between the two strategies how much more will the 30 year mortgage cost you in interest if you pay it off in 15 years that amount equates to the cost of an insurance policy for dealing with an occasional cash shortage do you want to pay thousands in extra interest for that insurance it is pretty pricey insurance one strategy would be to go with the 30 year now make the extra principal payments to keep you on a 15 year schedule see how life goes and refinance to a 15 year mortgage after a couple years if everything goes well and your cash reserves are strong unfortunately rates are likely to rise over the next couple years which makes this strategy less attractive if at all possible go with the 15 year so you lock in these near historic low rates consider buying less house or dropping back to the 30 year if you are worried that your cash reserves wo n't be able to handle life 's little surprises

i 'd like to add that many companies offer divident re investment plans or drips which is basically a regular automatic stock purchase program more info here while your stock broker may offer dividend reinvestment this is not the same as a drip drips are offered directly by the company rather than the stock broker they have the added benefits that the stock purchases are almost always commission free and in some cases the company even offers a discount on the stock price it can take a little more effort to get enrolled in a drip but if you are interested in holding the stock long term this is a good option to consider

hi i 'm the writer thanks for the read and the comment with the statement you quoted i 'm trying to dispute the claim that people these days ca n't afford a house because they would have to pay their entire salary just to afford the mortgage which i think is quite common in some circles the data makes no statement as to whether home ownership is more affordable or not but simply shows that those buying property are using around the same percentage of their income to pay for it which the data clearly shows to be true      as it turns out home ownership levels have remained within ~5 of their 1980 levels based on percentage of the total population i think there is an major classification flaw when comparing only sales because a great deal of people inherit property with no sale ever being made

advice from a long time flipper you negotiate price based on four factors and none of these are set in stone how much you love the house   is this house a 100 out of 100 for you or a 85 or a 75   how much have you compromised what is the likelihood that you will find a house that will make you just as happy or at least close   you might have a house that is a 95 out of 100 but there are five other houses that you rated between 93 95    what is your timeframe   know that playing takes longer and can knock you out of the game sometimes and takes a little while to find a new game what is the relative housing market   zillow and other such sites are crap   yes the give you a generalized feel for a community but their estimates are off sometimes by 30 40   other factors like street noise updates to and so on are huge factors   you will have to really navigate the area and look for very comparable houses that have recently sold   then use average housing movements to extrapolate your future houses cost as a buyer you have two jobs   buy the house you want and manage your agent   your agent wants you to buy a house as soon as possible and to increase their reputation   those are their only two factors of working    by you offering closer to the asking price they are able to get their sales as quick as possible   also other agents will love working with them   in fact your agent is selling you on the home and the price   agents hardly worry about you paying too much as most buyers the deal they get on their home   admitting that you paid too much for your house is more of an admission of ignorance of yourself compared to agent if you decide to low ball the owner your agent spends more time with you and possibly reduces their reputation with the selling agent   so it is common for agents to tell you that you should not offer a low price as you will insult the owner my advice   unless the home is truly one of a kind for the market offering anything within 20 of the asking price is definitely within range   i have offered 40 less   if a house is asking too much and has been on the market for 8 months there is no way i am going in with an offer of even 15 lower   that leaves you no room    what you do first think about how much you think this house could sell for in the next 3 months   in your example let 's say 80 k based on conservative comps   then take the most you would actually pay for it   let 's say   70 k is about as high of an opening offer i would go    do not tell your agent your true breaking points   if you tell your agent that you would go to 75 k on the house   then that is what their negotiations will start at   remember they want the sale to happen as soon as possible   very likely the other agent especially if they know each other will ask if how flexible you are going to be   then next thing you know your agent calls you back and says would you be willing to go 77 k or the owner is firm at do not give up your position   you should never forecast to your agent what your next bid or offer would be for the house   never get into scenarios or future counters    so you offer   if your agent asks you how firm that is   very firm   if your agent does n't want to take the offer to them thank you for being my agent but i am going to be working with someone that represents what i want    if the owner says you are done too me   well that 's how it goes   if the owner stays firm at asking or lowers then you can come up if you feel comfortable doing so   but understand what your goal is   is it to get a house or to get a good deal on a house   mine was always to get a good deal on a house   so i might offer 72 k next   if they did n't budge i am out   if they moved down i went from there    easy summary the fact is if they are n't willing to negotiate with you enough it always ends the same   you give them your take it or leave it offer   you tell your agent that if he she comes back with one penny over it comes from their commission god i have said this 100 times in my life and it is the best negotiation tactic you have with your agent   the owner says yes or no and it is over

it depends   high net worth individuals is very subjective    lets say a person is worth 1.5 million   high but not super high   for one they should have an umbrella policy   until your net worth is above 300 k you really do n't need an umbrella policy   they should insure their home and cars but should probably have high deductibles   health insurance is a must as a bad illness can wipe them out   they should have long term care insurance when they reach age 60    now lets say a person is worth about 10 million   they might be able to self insure basic transportation and probably do n't need long term care insurance   however they may choose to carry the full coverage car insurance or other lines because it is a value    in conclusion insurance needs change based on a person 's net worth and income   it is very hard to make a blanket statement without details of the makeup of one 's net worth and how they earn their income having said all of that a high net worth hnw individual may never be able to drop certain coverage   lets say that a hnw owns a 50 k condo 1 k square foot condo   given that the outside structure is covered by the hoa the insurance on such a unit only covers the contents and liability   the contents could easily be floated by the hnw individual but not the liability   it is probably a requirement on their umbrella policy that they carry the maximum liability protection on their vehicles and properties   in the case above they would carry a policy for the purposes of liability protection this could also be true of their dependents   say for example their adult child receives some financial assistance from their parents like college being paid for   the hnw individuals should have their child cover the maximum liability on the auto policy according to this site   a person with a net worth of 1.5 million would be in the 90 95 percentile a person with 10 million in the this article does a decent job of describing what constitutes a hnw person or household   namely 1 million in investable assets which is of course a bit different then net worth

remember that long term appreciation has tax advantages over short term dividends if you buy shares of a company never earn any dividends and then sell the stock for a profit in 20 years you 've essentially deferred all of the capital gains taxes and thus your money has compounded faster for a 20 year period for this reason i tend to favor non dividend stocks because i want to maximize my long term gain another example in estate planning is something called a step up basis

one reason is that you can trade in the ira without incurring incremental taxes along the way   this may be especially important if you intend to shift your portfolio allocation as you approach retirement   for instance gradually selling stocks and buying bonds can incur taxes if you do it in a taxable account if you do it while you have other income and thus may face capital gains taxes   also if you have mutual funds in a taxable account they may distribute capital gains to you that you 'll owe taxes on but holding the funds in an ira will shield you from that there are also some other side benefits to iras because they are considered to not count for certain purposes when determining what you 're worth   for instance if you go bankrupt you could be forced to sell assets in taxable accounts to pay your creditors whereas iras are protected in many cases   likewise if you try to get financial aid to pay for college for your kids money in an ira wo n't be counted among your assets in determining your aid eligibility potentially giving your kids access to more aid money finally an especially prominent benefit is the early withdrawal penalty   for many people part of the purpose of an ira is to lock away their money and prevent themselves from accessing it until retirement   early withdrawal penalties provide a concrete consequence that psychologically them from raiding their retirement savings willy nilly

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

i think it 's apt to remind that there 's no shortcuts if someone thinks about doing fx   fx negative sum game big spread or commissions chaos theory description is apt hard to understand costs options are insurance and for every trade there is equivalent option position so unless you understand how those are priced there 's a good chance you 're getting a deal as that goldman guy famously said averaging can help if timing is bad but you could be just getting deeper into the deal i just mentioned and giving a smarter counterparty your money could backfire as it 's the ammo they can use to defend their position   this does n't apply to your small hedge trade well that 's what i thought not long ago too that 's why i mentioned chaos theory if you can find a party to hedge with that is not hedging with someone who eventually ends up hedging with jpm goldman name any 0 losing days a year bank then you may have a point and contrary to what many may still think all of the above applies to everything you can think of that has to do with money all the billions with days need to come from somewhere and it 's definitely not coming just from couple fx punters

k welcome to money se   you knew enough to add good tags to the question now you should search on the dozens of questions with those tags to understand in less than an hour far more than that banker knows about credit and credit scores   my advice is first never miss a payment ever the advice your father passed on to you is nonsense plain and simple i 'm just a few chapters shy of being able to write a book about the incorrect advice i 'd heard bank people give their customers the second bit of advice is that you do n't need to pay interest to have credit cards show good payment history i.e. if you choose to use credit cards use them for the convenience cash rebates tracking and guarantees they can offer pay in full each bill   last use a free service first annualcreditreport.com to get a copy of your credit report and then a service like credit karma for a simulated fico score and advice on how to improve it as member has commented discover not just for cardholders offers a look at your actual score as do a number of other credit cards for members   by the way i would n't be inclined to discuss this with dad most people take offense that you 'd believe strangers more than them most of the answers here are well documented with links to irs etc and if not quickly peer reviewed when i make a mistake a top rated member will correct me within a day if not just minutes

account statements and the account information provided by your personal finance software should be coming from the same source namely your bank 's internal accounting records so in theory one is just as good as the other that being said an account statement is a snapshot of your account on the date the statement was created while with your personal finance application is dynamically generated upon request usually once a day or upon login   so what are the implications of this your account statement will not show transactions that may have taken place during that period but were n't posted until after the period ended common with credit card transactions and checks instead they 'd appear on the next statement because electronic account are more frequent and not limited to a specific time period those transactions will show up shortly after they are posted so it is far easier to keep track of your accounts electronically every personal finance software i 've ever used supports manual entries so what i like to do is on a daily basis i manually enter any transaction which was n't posted automatically this usually only takes a few minutes each evening then when the transaction eventually shows up it 's usually reconciled with my manually entered one automatically   aside from finding infrequent bank errors this has the benefit of keeping me aware of how much i 'm spending and how much i have left i 've also caught a number of cashier errors this way noticing i was double charged for an item while entering the receipt total and its the best defense against fraud and identity theft i can think of if you 're looking at your accounts on a daily basis you 're far more likely to notice an unusual transaction than any monitoring service

pulling money out of a credit card is generally a bad idea   you 'll be hit with interest from day 1 and some credit cards have cash advance fees on top of that if you are really desperate for running up an automatic charge on your credit card to maintain use then you have a few options personally the charity route makes the most sense to me   you can probably set up an automatic donation of less than 5 quid and it may be tax deductible to boot   plus you 're helping an organization that hopefully is doing some good in the world

i 'm not going to tackle the 2nd part of your question as any number of the questions tagged with international transfer should cover you on that there 's no way to transfer an isa into an australian tax free savings account so no need to worry about anything special there do n't forget that the fx rates change quite a bit over time and different methods have varying fees so moving at the wrong time could easily cost you more than the missed interest for the first part it depends one thing you should seriously consider right away is switching your isa money into one paying a better rate check the best buy tables online or in a paper as you can get a lot better than 0.1 on a transfer in even with current depressed rates at least that way you 'll earn more interest while you decide as for when to transfer that 's something you 'll have to calculate for yourself based on your marginal tax rate and your view of how the fx rates will shift if you 're a 40 taxpayer then 2 in an isa is worth the same to you as 3.3 gross do n't forget to consider both your uk and australian tax rates in the year you move as most likely you 'll have to pay the higher of the two the westpac rate looks like you might struggle to beat a decent isa over the course of a year were you a higher rate tax payer oh and do n't forget that you 'll likely loose the tax free status of your isa once you 're an australian tax resident so you 'll need to start paying tax on interest in the isa once you 're out there

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

your premise is false   when you withdraw money from a tax free savings account tfsa there is no   tax   due   yes you can read that again   withdrawals from a tfsa are tax free   they are labeled tax free for a good reason   after tax money is deposited and then from that point forward no tax no tax no tax   on a normal non registered investment or savings account with no special treatment your investment earnings will be taxed whenever gains are realized or income received e.g. dividends or interest   you will necessarily have less in a normal non registered investment or savings account compared to a tfsa as long as the rate of return was positive i.e. growing perhaps you were thinking not of comparing a regular investment account to a tfsa but rather to a registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of an rrsp there is an up front tax deduction then earnings grow tax deferred and then on withdrawal income tax is paid at regular rates   even then with rrsps if your marginal tax rate remains the same over time not necessarily a reasonable assumption but let 's go with it then you should still realize more after tax income from your rrsp than from a normal non registered investment or savings account   though there 's likely an exception case when most income came as qualified dividends and the capital itself has n't appreciated

the appropriate structure for an organization depends largely on the size of the firm smaller firms can employ some non traditional more easily i.e. flat design whereas the same structures are more difficult to use in mid size and large companies the most important pieces of any corporate structure are 1 clarity of roles 2 accountability and 3 ease of communication   firstly everyone in the organization must have clarity of their own role and how it fits into the bigger picture that means a structure that is easy to understand and a comprehension of how all the roles tie in to each other    secondly a good structure will enable and empower leadership to hold the team accountable and be held accountable in turn what is often misunderstood about accountability is that people often assume that it simply means punishing poor behavior when something breaks down in reality that 's holding people responsible not accountable accountability is something that is self driven and is a product of sound relationships and transparency as an example one of the most common breakdowns in accountability is found in passive non this is when you may reach out to a business partner for help or an update but they simply do not reply as in email text or    thirdly the structure should be such that it is easy for individuals to communicate across and up down the chain this does n't mean that if you send an email communication is easy rather who do i reach out to for this problem what are the best practices or agreed upon methodologies for a certain practice and how does the team know this some of this should be codified in the form of standard operating procedures which can be referenced at any time many companies use a playbook which is a high level reference guide on how to operate the business an example is found here a playbook can be anything from a pdf to an interactive website like the aforementioned link it should always have the most up to date information   most companies will change their structure over time as their environment both internal and external change and they need to adapt for example a small firm may not need an hr department but as it employs more and more people a need to have someone or an entire team focused on human capital management rises quickly an owner operator can handle only so much before it is time to scale up   the most important thing to consider is who you hire people are the largest expense to an organization and having the right people in the right roles is the best way to avoid unnecessary incremental costs resulting from inefficiency fraud or risky behavior always look for the personality traits that make a good employee relative to the role i.e. customer service finance integrity operations teamwork   one of the most obvious parts of a business as it scales up is specialization you want to find a balance though for example hr handles all human relations issues while legal handles all internal claims suits and patents there is an overlap that occurs here as internal claims often start as human relations issues which means you must have healthy communication and clear accountability for an appropriate hand off so legal takes a claim at the right point in time while this example may be a little obvious many times the edges are blurred and clarity of role can be difficult   i hope that helps reach out with any follow up questions

gt why should we trust big to release accurate information that may be to their business   enforcement via inspection you only need to check up on a small portion of claims to ensure accuracy have hefty fines for inaccurate information and jail time for anyone who intentionally   gt;the problem is that the usda has been underfunded to the point that it 's completely incapable of doing the amount of inspections needed    there 's a simple and obvious solution to that   do n't know what they need to be educated about and rely on reporters and experts to make recommendations and revelations on their behalf    that 's why there 's a mix of sources indeed consumers do n't know but they still have the right to ask silly questions actual knowledgeable people are also involved so that actual meaningful questions be answered   all laws that restrict the first amendment when it comes to our food disparaging a food product should not be illegal in a free country public health should be more important than sales of products   those laws are in part there to protect public safety causing an unfounded panic over food products could be disastrous public health is the justification for those laws existing not protecting sales

     over 1,300 tubes containing radioactive water inside san nuclear plant 's steam generators in california has been reportedly damaged enough that they need to be taken out of service to date the safety of tubing that snakes around the plant 's 4 steam generators were installed in a multimillion dollar upgrade three years ago according to the company 's official statement on monday tubes in unit 3 and 510 tubes from unit 2 reactors were retired every generator has almost 10,000 tubes and the total number of plugged tubes would not affect a proper operation of the plant   the chairman of edison sce 's parent company reportedly called investors to notify them of the premature wear found in around 1 of tubes in the generators a nuclear norton medical and scientific research amp biotechnology issued a warning saying in effect that it seems the new steam generators are falling apart and edison does n't know why it would be foolhardy to restart even at reduced power under the current circumstances the nuclear plant is owned by the city together with san diego gas and electric and sce a joint statement released last week by the california independent system operator and edison gave possible dates this june for planning however government regulators were quick to assert that there is no timetable for a restart something that would still need a federal approval the alert concerns from an incident in january when the third reactor was shut off after a tube broke but although radiation has during that time officials were quick to assure residents and workers that there was no imminent danger earlier that month the second unit was shut down for its regular maintenance but investigators discovered instead of premature wear on hundreds of tubes that were only installed 2 years ago by mitsubishi heavy industries the first unit operated on 1968 was dismantled in 1992 the tubes stand for a crucial safety barrier that is if a tube breaks then there is considerable chance for to escape onto the atmosphere serious leaks could also use up the protective cooling water employed in a reactor sce estimates that the repair expenses could cost about usd 55 to 65 million aside from the initial usd 30 million it has spent to replace the output from the 2 reactors earlier this year

that something you are signing means you are liable for the mortgage payments yes all of them if he ca n't or wo n't pay at any point   the limit on what the bank will lend him based on his salary is there for a reason they do n't expect him to be able to keep up repayments if they lend him more or more precisely there 's a big risk that he wo n't do n't forget that even if he up and down to you that he can afford them interest rates can rise this is a 25 or 30 year commitment you would be making interest rates are at a historic low and the only way from here is up in my living memory rates have been 12 or even 15 as a very rough rule of thumb for every £ 100k borrowed every additional 1 on the interest rates costs an additional £ 100 on your monthly payment   also the transitional arrangement is not without its own fees and the bank wo n't let him simply take you off the mortgage unless they are convinced he can keep up the repayments on his own which they clearly are n't also thanks to for the additional good point that being on the hook for your friend 's mortgage will prevent you from being able to get a mortgage yourself while the liability still exists or at least severely limit your options no matter how many times you protest but i 'm not paying any money for that it wo n't help   another point there are various schemes available to help first time buyers by signing up for this you would exclude yourself from any of those schemes in the future

ianal or an accountant but there is a useful notion of technical insolvency which you it sounds like you probably meet and which is a distinct concept from actual insolvency couple of choice quotes from that link if a company or person is technically insolvent that merely means    that it has a negative net asset value its liabilities are greater    than its assets    the significance of technical insolvency depends on circumstances it    may be an indicator of serious problems that may lead to actual    insolvency or it may be perfectly acceptable a technically insolvent company is free to keep trading as long as the    directors reasonably believe that the company will be able to pay its    debts and again as long as an creditor does not use the    courts to force a liquidation which is basically what @keshlam 's comment on your question is saying

walmart 's success is built on the backs of these so called low skill workers last time i checked walmart was making huge profits every quarter so maybe the people who are doing all of the hard work deserve a living wage also there are several trained skills walmart employees have for example to work in produce and the deli you have to be trained in safe food practices a walmart employee also has to have time management skills employees are often are assigned multiple tasks in several departments also the computer systems must be learned if i handed you a i doubt you would be able to check to see if an item was in stock and if it was n't how to order a new one also anyone can be a cashier but can anyone be a fast efficient cashier you are also putting your body at risk especially when you are tasked with unloading trucks or stocking shelves several of my ex coworkers have work related injuries the most common are bad knees backs and shoulders in short if every walmart worker in the nation went on strike walmart would find it impossible to find enough skilled workers to fill their rolls sure they could replace them easily but it would take months for the new employees to learn the necessary skills and while they are learning walmart would have incredibly long lines and lots of unsatisfied customers   in an unrelated note please excuse any spelling or formatting errors i am typing this on my phone

the hire a pro is quite correct if you are truly making this kind of money that said i believe in a certain amount of self education so you do n't follow a pro 's advice blindly first i wrote an article that discussed marginal tax rates and it 's worth understanding it simply means that as your income rises past certain thresholds the tax rate also will change a bit you are on track to be in the top rate 33   next solo 401(k you did n't ask about retirement accounts but the combined situations of making this sum of money and just setting it aside leads me to suggest this since you are both employer and employee the solo 401(k limit is a combined $ seems like a lot but if you are really on track to make $ 500 k this year that 's just over 10 saved    then whatever the pro recommends for your status you 'll still have some kind of social security obligation as both employer and employee so that 's another 15 or so for the first $   last some of the answers seemed to imply that you 'll settle in april not quite you are required to pay your tax through the year and if you wait until april to pay the tax along with your return you will have a very unpleasant tax bill i mean it will have penalties for underpayment through the year this is to be avoided   i offer this because often a pro will have a specialty and not go outside that focus it 's possible to find the guy that knows everything about setting you up as an llc or sole proprietorship yet does n't have the 401(k conversation   good luck please let us know here how the pro discussion goes for you

right now the unrealized appreciation of vanguard tax managed    small cap fund admiral shares is of nav as long as the fund    delivers decent returns over the long term is there anything stopping    this amount from ballooning to say 90 fifty years hence i 'd have a heck of a time imagining how this grows to that high a number realistically   the inflows and outflows of the fund are a bigger question along with what kinds of changes are there to capital gains that may make the fund try to hold onto the stocks longer and minimize the tax burden if this happens wo n't new investors be scared away by the prospect of    owing taxes on these gains for example a financial crisis or a    superior new investment technology could lead investors to dump their    shares of tax managed index funds triggering enormous capital gains    distributions and if new investors are scared away wo n't the fund be    forced to sell its assets to cover redemptions even if there is no    disruptive event leading to larger capital gains distributions than    in the past possibly but you have more than a few assumptions in this to my mind that i wonder how well are you estimating the probability of this happening finally do etfs avoid this problem assuming it is a problem yes etfs have creation and redemption units that allow for in kind transactions and thus there is n't a selling of the stock   however if one wants to pull out various unlikely scenarios then there is the potential of the market being shut down for an extended period of time that would prevent one from selling shares of the etf that may or may not be as applicable as open end fund shares i would however suggest researching if there are hybrid funds that mix open end fund shares with etf shares which could be an alternative here

any way you look at it this is a terrible idea cars lose value   they are a disposable item that gets used up   the more expensive the car the more value they lose if you spend $ 100,000 on a new car in four years it will be worth less than $ 50,000   that is a lot of money to lose in four years in addition to the loss of value you will need to buy insurance which for a $ 100,000 car is incredible if your heart is set on this kind of car you should definitely save up the cash and wait to buy the car   do not get a loan   here is why your plan has you saving $ 1,300 a month $ 16,000 a year for 6.5 years before you will be able to buy this car   that is a lot of money for a long range goal   if you faithfully save this money that long and at the end of the 6.5 years you still want this car it is your money to spend as you want   you will have had a long time to reconsider your course of action but you will have sacrificed for a long time and you will have the money to lose   however you may find out a year into this process that you are spending too much money saving for this car and reconsider if instead you take out a loan for this car then by the time you decide the car was too much of a stretch financially it will be too late   you will be upside down on the loan and it will cost you thousands to sell the car so go ahead and start saving   if you have n't given up before you reach your goal you may find that in 6.5 years when it is time to write that check you will look back at the sacrifices you have made and decide that you do n't want to simply blow that money on a car consider a different goal   if you invest this $ 1300 a month and achieve 8 growth you will be a millionaire in 23 years you do n't need to take my word for it   look at the car you are interested in go to select the 2012 version of the car and look up the private sale value   you 'll most likely see a price that is about half of what a new one costs

you said all terrorists are muslims which is not true at all because most acts of terror comes from right population most common are the burning down a house and personal attacks on looking guys at least in germany do nt know about other countries but i can not imagine it much different   cause and effect and quantity is a terror attack more harmful if more people heard of it effect on who i can imagine you talking in public is pretty scary for foreigners which is the point of the hate speech topic lets not drag the topic in here too because its very complicated just for your information i m very much in favour of fighting the cause of immigration and helping where it is needed and not letting millions walk thousands of miles to get to safety of to make a living funny how your mind works criminal immigrants are not accepted in germany by the way and if they get criminal here they get deported the crime rate of the refugees is actually a bit lower then the rate of the rest of the population so not big a problem which makes sense if you think about it it was hard to get here and they do nt want to go back    do you think a rightwing would attack muslims if they did not attack westerners do you think rightwing attacks are more than muslim attacks are they even 1 of all attacks and harm      this is the core problem i am talking about this is why millions of germans slaughtered the jewish population this is the result of hate speech and hard right propaganda the difference between now and then swap jew with muslim the muslims are to blame for the crime attacking our women the bad economy it is exactly the same mindset people then were no different then people now they did think they help germany by getting rid of those pests most of them did nothing at all and after the war they said they did n't know about any attacks or of jews needles to say that the actual crime rate if jews in germany was no different then the non jew crime rate just as it is now with muslims the overall crime rate rise significantly though since the start of the refugees crisis as a result of massive right wing activity you said you hate nazis a while back i do n't think you know what a nazi is and sure enough i called you one and you did not deny my friend i was wrong about you you are a helpless cause with terrible arguments based on prejudice and hate i still did enjoy this conversation because it was a mostly civil and b gave me a very good look into the mindset of a nazi you may be happy to here that i realized while researching the topic that the problem of nazis is much bigger then i have thought and i can not ignore it anymore and have to join the fight good day to you and may reason catch up to you in your future life

former wfm team member here about a decade and still have a lot of store management staff as friends   wfm has always wanted to be the tech company of grocery stores but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity   imagine wfm as really 7 different companies that have almost zero in common with each other from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems so they 've never been able to get the it part of their business to be effective even though they 've desperately wanted to because every region has had different it that was n't entirely compatible with the others   on top of that they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system that did not work you ca n't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was   with amazon coming in hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh using wfm 's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings honestly i think amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain   a lot of what 's holding wfm back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs they 're relying on which is in my experience not exactly great if amazon can utilize what they do well inventory management shipping technology and business support services i think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20 25 target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods because right now they 're getting absolutely by kroger trader joe 's walmart sprouts and so many others

a company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued share price and strike price both at $ 1 what country is this related to    i ask because in the us most people i know associate a call option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares    so 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares which exceeds the number of shares you 're saying the company has    i do n't know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air or whether it means you 're thinking of a different type of option perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees   each one of those is equivalent to a single share   they just are n't called call options in the rest of my answer i 'm going to assume you meant stock options i assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution i do n't think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place   said another way a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock   they then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool rather than outright grants of the stock for various reasons   one of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no us tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock an alternative scenario when the company shares are traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised   in this case the company needs the cash on hand or cash flow to take money from to buy those shares at current prices anyway in either case there is no dilution happening when the options get exercised   any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created    meaning the total number of shares in the company was already pre set at an earlier time   as a result the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock however price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments    this is almost the same thing you 're asking about but it is technically different as to timing if this is the case can this be factored into any option pricing models like black scholes you 're including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling

tl dr you should read something like the little book of common sense investing and read some of the popular questions on this site the main message that you will get from that research is that there is an connection between risk and reward or to put it another way volatility and reward things like government bonds and money market accounts have quite low risk but also low reward they offer a nearly guaranteed 1 3 stocks high risk bonds or business ventures like your soda and vending machine scheme may return 20 a year some years but you could also lose money maybe all you 've invested e.g. what if a breaks one of your machines or the government adds a $ 5 tax for each can of soda research has shown that the best way for the normal person to use their money to make money is to buy index funds these are funds that buy a bunch of different stocks and to hold them for a long time over 10 15 years by buying a broad range of stocks you avoid some of the risks of investing e.g. if one company 's stock tanks you do n't lose very much while keeping most of the benefits by keeping them for a long time the good years more than even out the bad years and you are almost guaranteed to make ~6 buying individual stocks is a really really bad idea if you are n't willing to invest the time to become an expert investor then you will almost certainly do worse than index funds over the long run another option is to use your capital to start a side business like your vending machine idea as mentioned before this still has risks one of those risks is that it will take more work than you expect who will find places for your vending machines who will fill them who will hire those who fill them etc the great thing about an index fund is that it does n't take work or research however if there are things that you want to do that take capital this can be a good way to make more income

this is a gross simplification as there are a few different ways to do this the principle overall is the same though to short a stock you borrow x shares from a third party and sell them at the current price you now owe the lender x shares but have the proceeds from the sale if the share price falls you can buy back those shares at the new lower price return them to the lender and pocket the difference the risk comes when the share price goes the other way you now owe the lender the new value of the shares so have to find some way to cover the difference this happened a while back when porsche made a fortune buying shares in volkswagen from short sellers and the price unexpectedly rose

automated clearing house transactions are used in the us for direct deposit of pay checks and direct debit of many payments for accounts such as mortgages credit cards car loans insurance premiums etc the reason they take one or more business days to clear is that the transactions are accumulated by each processor in the network during the day and processed as a batch at the end of each business day   the ach network processes 20 + billion transactions per year worth $ 40 trillion estimates based on 2012 figures

maybe if it required immense talent or skill it would all you really need to do is be able to handle people for several hours a day which is a prerequisite to any job instead you get a bunch of salty usually individuals with zero marketable skills who could n't get a job elsewhere or are lazy and know they can slack off like shit and not get fired working there my best friend and roommate was one of those people and he worked there a year and barely got the minimum raises everyday he about how dumb everyone he worked with was despite the fact he 's one of the dumbest people i know he thought the world owed him something and he did n't care how he got it that was about 60 of the people there that i knew on the other hand the other 40 of people i knew working there were still young kids but did n't think every person with a somewhat dumb question was an idiot they showed up on time got their work done and were pleasant to be around despite having a shitty job they were the same age and from the same background as my friend but they did n't come to work with a chip on their shoulder after several months most of them had been promoted to higher positions or even assistant managers they were making considerably more money and had more responsibility they could not be replaced the next day by someone with no training or experience and were worth even more to the company than their time a dozen former peers who acted like assholes   if you let your starting salary or position dictate your attitude toward a job you 're never going to get anywhere in life the world does n't owe a huge salary and benefits i 'm hardly arguing for big companies that can and do treat employees badly but having seen what that sometimes consists of i do n't tend to get my panties in a bunch over it anymore i 've worked my fair share of shit jobs in the beating sun and heat for shit money and i did n't treat people like shit because of it hell i actually really enjoyed one of them the difference is i never thought the world owed me something because two people had the idea to fuck one night

well what you are asking is emi which comes to in your case   the formula you are applying is of compounding a value which is completely different   in emi person keeps paying money every month or any other period as specified this amount is firstly allocated towards the interest for the period and the balance for principal amount so in effect principal keeps decreasing and subsequently interest also since interest is getting paid every time it becomes due compounding actually do not happen at all   in the case of compounding interest gets applied at certain interval but do not get paid so in effect every time when interest gets applied it applies on complete principal outstanding as well as interest unpaid hence this complete amount gets payable at the end in this case total amount payable is obviously high because of 2 reasons 1 since principal gets unpaid during whole period you are paying interest on complete amount for complete period   2 you will be paying interest on interest compounding of interest since you are not paying it as it is becoming due hence both are different you need to find emi calculator or emi formula to achieve your purpose edit the formula for calculating emi assuming a loan of rs 1 at 9 per annum in 15 years the emi calculation using the formula will be emi = × × 1 + 180 ÷ 1 + 180 1 = 750 × ÷ = 750 × =

i do appreciate the explanation   i was being a bit facetious about in that i do n't buy the same over and over again     but seriously i still do n't see why rising house prices should n't count towards inflation    100s of thousands of homes are bought per day affecting millions of consumers per day   the price fluctuations in housing absolutely affect the spending habits of consumers in every other facet of the economy   or put another way what if in some wacky world everyone stopped buying virtually all other items except bare essentials because they were all focused on buying homes   a huge construction industry boom millions are working building homes   home prices skyrocket 1000 and become like 80 of gdp   is inflation dead or has it just shifted to another asset under our typical inflation radar   living costs are still very much affected by housing in this scenario   they 're just affected by millions of separate people at once each day    to say that because one person does n't repeat buy housing too often means policy regarding inflation should be ignorant of housing prices just is n't right   that they are bought and sold by millions of consumers each month is just as important to the economy as food energy or any other major facet of our economy in any event inflation might be lagging but it sure as hell is n't lagging when it comes to housing

good question very well asked the key here is that you need to find a solution that works for you two without an overt amount of effort   so in a sense it is somewhat behavior driven but it is also technology driven    my wife and i use spreadsheets for both checking account management and budgeting   a key time saver is that we have a template sheet that gets copied and pasted then modified for the current month   typically 90 of the stuff is the same and each month requires very little modification   this is one of my problems with everydollar   i have to enter everything each and every month we also have separate checking accounts and responsibility for different areas of the family expenses   doing this risks that we act as roommates but we both clearly understand the money in one persons account equally belongs to the other and during hard times had to make up for shortfalls on the part of the other also we use cash for groceries eating out and other day to day expenses   so we do n't have a great need to track expenses or enter transactions that is what works for us and it takes us very little time to manage our money   the budget meeting normally lasts less than a half hour and that includes goal tracking we kind of live by the 80/20 principle   we do n't see a value in tracking where every dime went   we see more value in setting and meeting larger financial goals like contributing x amount to retirement and things of that nature   if we overspent a bit at walgreens who cares provided the larger goals are meant and we do not incur debt

it depends on how much you save how much your savings earns each year   you can model it with a very simple spreadsheet   formula view   you can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model this spreadsheet presumes that you only make $ never get a raise that your savings earns 6 per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008 the article never states the assumptions that the author has made and therefore we ca n't honestly determine how truthful the author is   i recommend the book engineering your retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details about what you should expect i wrote a slightly more detailed post that showed a spreadsheet that is basically what i use at home to track my retirement savings

trying to figure out how much money you have available each day sounds like you 're making this more complicated than it needs to be unless you 're extremely tight and you 're trying to squeeze by day by day asking do i have enough cash to buy food for today and so on you 're doing too much work here 's what i do i make a list of all my bills some are a fixed amount every month like the mortgage and insurance premiums others are variable like electric and heating bills but still pretty predictable   most bills are monthly but i have a few that come less frequently like water bills in my area come every 3 months and i have to pay property taxes twice a year for these you have to calculate how much they cost each month like for the water bill it 's once every 3 months so i divide a typical bill by 3 always round up or estimate a little high to be safe groceries are a little tricky because i do n't buy groceries on any regular schedule and sometimes i buy a whole bunch at once and other times just a few things when groceries were a bigger share of my income i kept track of what i spent for a couple of months to figure out an average per month today i 'm a little richer and i just think of groceries as coming from my spending money i allocate a percentage of my income for contributions to church and charities and count this just like bills it 's a good idea to put aside something for savings and/or paying down any outstanding loans every month then i add these up to say okay here 's how much i need each month to pay the bills subtract that from my monthly income and that 's what i have for spending money i get paid twice a month so i generally pay bills when i get paid for most bills the due date is far enough ahead that i can wait the maximum half a month to pay it worst case the bill comes the day after i pay the bills from this paycheck   then i keep enough money in my checking account to a cover any bills until the next paycheck and allow for the particularly large bills and b provide some cushion in case i make a mistake forget to record a check or make an arithmetic error or whatever and c provide some cushion for short term unexpected expenses to be safe a should be the total of your bills for a month or as close to that as you can manage b should be a couple of hundred dollars if you can manage it more if you make a lot of mistakes if you 've calculated your expenses properly and only spend the difference keeping enough money in the bank should fall out naturally i think it 's a lot easier to try to manage your money on a monthly basis than on a daily basis most of us do n't spend money every day and we spend wildly different amounts from day to day most days i probably spend zero but then one day i 'll buy a new tv or computer and spend hundreds   update in response to question what i do in real life is this to calculate my available cash to spend i simply take the balance in my checking account assuming that all checks and electronic payments have cleared my mortgage is deducted from my checking every month so i post that to my checking a month in advance i pay a lot of things with automatic charges to a credit card these days so my credit card bills are large and ca n't be ignored so subtract my credit card balances subtract my reserve amount what 's left is how much i can afford to spend so for example say i look at the balance in my checkbook today and it 's say $ 3000 that 's the balance after any checks and other transactions have cleared and after subtracting my next mortgage payment then i subtract what i owe on credit cards let 's say that was $ 1,200 so that leaves $ 1,800 i try to keep a reserve of $ 1,500 that 's plenty to pay my routine monthly bills and leave a healthy reserve so subtract another $ 1,500 leaves $ 300 that 's how much i can spend i could keep track of this with a spreadsheet or a database but what would that gain the amount in my checking account is actual money any spreadsheet could accumulate errors and get farther and farther from accurate values i use a spreadsheet to figure out how much spending money i should have each month but that 's just to use as a guideline if it came to say $ 100 i would n't make plans about buying a new mercedes if it came to $ 5,000 a month than buying a fancy new car might be realistic it also tells me how much i can spend without having to carefully check balances and add it up these days i have a fair amount of spending money so when for example i recently decided i wanted to buy some software that cost $ 100 i just bought it with barely a second thought when my spending money was more like $ 100 a month lunch at a fast food place was a big event that i planned weeks in advance obviously i hope do n't get stupid about small amounts if you can easily afford $ 100 for an impulse purchase that does n't mean that you can afford $ 100 five times a day every day two caveats 1 it helps to have a limited number of credit cards so you can keep the balances under control i have two credit cards i use for almost everything so i only have two balances to keep track of i used to have more and it got confusing it was easy to lose track of how much i really owed which is a set up for getting in trouble

currently there is simply no reason to do so it 's not a problem it is no more of a problem or effort to denote 5,000 than it is to denote 50.00 but if there were a reason to do so it would n't be all that difficult of course there would be some minor complications because some people mostly old people presumably would take time getting used to it but nothing that would stop a nation from doing so in iceland this has happened on several occasions in the past and while iceland is indeed a very small economy it should n't be that difficult at all for a larger one a country would need a grace period while the old currency is still valid new editions of already circulating cash would need to be produced and a coordinated time would need to be set at which point financial institutions change their balances of course it would take some planning and coordination but nothing close to for example two or more currencies into one like the did with the euro the biggest side effect there was an inflation shot when the currencies got changed in each country but this can be done even with giant economies like germany and france cutting off two zeros would be a in comparison but in case of currencies like the japanese yen there is simply no reason to take off 2 zeros yet northern americans may find it strange that the numbers are so high but that 's merely a matter of what you 're used to there is no added complication in paying vs. 50 at a restaurant it merely takes more space on a computer screen and bill and that 's not a real problem besides most of the time even in n america the cents are listed as well and that does n't seem to be enough of a problem for people to concern themselves with it 's only when you get into hyper inflation when the shear space required for prices becomes a problem that economies have a real reason to cut off zeros

if there is land for sale you can buy it the united states does n't have many restrictions on the purchase of land however you need to be able to afford it dependent on where you are looking $ 20,000 can either be a lot or very little land i suspect that the question you were looking to ask is can i afford it have a look around there should be plenty of places for you to find land for sale as for credit it is more important that you do n't build bad credit with things like mortgages your salary is likely to be more important than your credit score alone but no one will give you a dime if you have a record of not paying your bills

is there a risk buying a used car via a proxy if i pay the actual owner    everything seems to be in order except one thing the actual owner x is     out of the country and the car is being sold by his relative y yes there is risk the risk is that the money never makes it to the actual owner you have a piece of paper that claims to give   permission to sell the car and the contact info for the real owner the risk is that it was forged or that some other part of the chain of trust is forged   maybe the car is stolen maybe this is part of a more complex scam and you are only a small part of it the risk is that you end up having to file a police report after the real owner reports it stolen and the car is taken from you or even worse you end up under arrest because they think you are the thief with tons of cars for sale why risk it of course if the deal is a bargain that may be designed to make you ignore the flashing warning light

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

one way to look at a butterfly is to break it into two trades a butterfly is actually made up of two verticals one is a debit vertical buy put and sell the 460 put   the other is a credit vertical sell a 460 put and buy a 430 put   if someone believes apple will fall to 460 that person could do a few things there are other strategies but this just compares the three common ones 1 buy a put this is expensive and if the stock only goes to 460 you overpay for it 2 buy a put vertical this is less expensive because you offset the price of your put 3 buy a butterfly this is cheapest of the three because you have the vertical in 2 as well as a credit vertical on top of that to offset your cost   the reason why someone would use the butterfly is to pay less upfront while capitalizing on a fall to 460 of the three this would be the better strategy to use if that happens but remember that this only applies if the trader is right and it goes to 460 there is always a trade off for every strategy that the trader must be aware of if the trader is wrong and apple goes to say 400 the put 1 would make the most money and the would lose money while the vertical 2 would still gain so that is what you 're sacrificing to get the benefits of the butterfly also helps to draw a diagram to compare the strategies

have you changed how you handle fund distributions   while it is typical to re invest the distributions to buy additional shares this may not make sense if you want to get a little cash to use for the home purchase   while you may already handle this it is n't mentioned in the question while it likely wo n't make a big difference it could be a useful factor to consider potentially if you ponder how risky is it having your down payment fluctuate in value from day to day   i 'd just think it is more convenient to take the distributions in cash and that way have fewer transactions to report in the following year   unless you have a working crystal ball there is no way to definitively predict if the market will be up or down in exactly 2 years from now   thus i suggest taking the distributions in cash and investing in something much lower risk like a money market mutual fund

if your money market funds are short term savings or an emergency fund you might consider   moving them into an online saving account   you can get interest rates close to 1 often above 1 in higher rate climates and your savings are completely safe and easily accessible   online banks also frequently offer perks such as direct deposit linking with your checking account and discounts on other services you might need occasionally i.e. money orders or certified checks    if your money market funds are the lowest risk part of your diversified long term portfolio you should consider how low risk it needs to be   money market accounts are now typically fdic insured they did n't used to be but you can get the same security at a higher interest rate with laddered cd 's or u.s. savings bonds if your horizon is compatible if you want liquidity or greater return than a cd will give you then a bond fund or etf may be the right choice and it will tend to move counter to your stock investments balancing your portfolio    it 's true that interest rates will likely rise in the future which will tend to decrease the value of bond investments   if you buy and hold a single u.s. savings bond its interest payments and final payoff are set at purchase so you wo n't actually lose money but you might make less than you would if you invested in a higher rate climate   another way to deal with this if you want to add a bond fund to your long term investment portfolio is to invest your money slowly over time dollar cost averaging so that you do n't pay a high price for a large number of shares that immediately drop in value

first it depends on your broker   full service firms will tear you a new one discount brokers may charge   you 'll have to check with your broker on assignment fees theoretically this is the case of the opposite of my answer in this question are underlying assets supposed to be sold bought immediately after being bought sold in call put option your trading strategy reasoning for your covered call notwithstanding in your case as an option writer covering in the money calls you want to hold and pray that your option expires worthless   as i said in the other answer there is always a theoretical premium of option price + exercise price to underlying prices no matter how slight right up until expiration so on that basis it does n't pay to close out the option however there 's a reality that i did n't mention in the other answer if it 's a deep in the money option you can actually put a bid < stock price exercise price trade fee and hope for the best since the market makers rarely bid above stock price exercise price for illiquid options but it 's unlikely that you 'll beat the market makers + hft   they 're systems are too fast i know the philly exchange allows you to put in implied volatility orders but they 're expensive and i could n't tell you if a broker exchange allows for dynamic orders with the equation i specified above but it may be worth a shot to check out however it 's unlikely that such a low order would ever be filled since you 'll at best be lined up with the market makers and it would require a big player dumping all its holdings at once to get to your order if you 're doing a traditional true blue covered call there 's absolutely nothing wrong being assigned except for the tax implications   when your counterparty calls away your underlyings it is a sell for tax purposes if you 're not covering with the underlying but with a more complex spread things could get hairy for you real quick if someone were to exercise on you but that 's always a risk   if your broker is extremely strict they may close the rest of your spread for you at the offer   in illiquid markets that would be a huge percentage loss considering the wide bid ask spreads

the new york times has a useful rent vs buy calculator   based on your numbers it suggests buying makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more   this is just based on default values for various other parameters though like mortgage interest rate rent increase rate etc   you could try playing around with the numbers   also as other said maintenance costs closing costs etc should be factored in if renting it out is a possibility even if you move out it could be a better deal   one thing to think about renting wise is if you move out where are you likely to move to   if you move far away it could be impractical to manage the property as a rental   you could hire someone else to do that but that would reduce your income from the rent   on the other hand if you stay in la it could be feasible to manage the property yourself another key factor is what rent would you be able to charge for this house   if you can make enough in rent to cover the mortgage payment you may be in good shape but due to overpriced real estate markets sometimes you wo n't be able to do that which would mean renting it might not be cost effective

excess cash = cash equivalents + long term investments current liabilities the problem this calculation of excess cash is that long term investments can be illiquid things like real estate another flaw is that it gives no credit for current assets like receivables which can be used to offset current liabilities the first thing i 'd do is net out current assets and current liabilities then add cash back in   excess cash = current assets current liabilities + cash equivalents it would be nice if gaap would require long term investments to be broken out as a liquid long term investments stocks bonds b illiquid long term investments real estate private equity etc

the essential and obvious thing to avoid getting back into debt or to reduce debt if you have it is to make your total income exceed your total expenses that means either increasing your income or reducing your total expenses    either take effort    basically you need a plan if your plan is to increase income work out how   if the plan is to increase hours in your current you need to allow for your needs sleep rest etc and also convince your employer they will benefit by paying you to work more hours    if your intent is to increase your hourly rate you need to convince a current or prospective employer that you have the capacity skills etc to deliver more on the job so you are worth paying more     if your intent is to get qualifications so you can get a better paying job work out how much effort studying etc you will apply over how long what expenses you will carry fees textbooks etc and how long you will carry them for will you accept working some years in a higher paying job to clear the debt most of those options involve a lot of work take time and often mean carrying debt until you are in a position to pay it off      there is nothing wrong with getting a job while studying but you have to be realistic about the demands    there is nothing about studying that means you should n't have a job    however you need to be clear how many hours you can work in a job before your studies will suffer unnecessarily and possibly accept the need to study part time so you can work which means the study will take longer but you wo n't struggle as much financially if your plan is to reduce expenses you need a budget     itemize all of your spend   do n't hide anything from that list no matter how small    work out which of the things you need paying off debt is one which you can get rid of which you need to reduce and by how much    be brutal with reducing or eliminating the non essentials no matter how much you would prefer otherwise   keep going until you have a budget in which your expenses are less than your income    then stick to it there is no other answer     revisit your budget regularly so you can handle things you have n't previously planned for say rent increase increase fees for something you need etc     if your income increases or you have a windfall do n't simply drop the budget the best way to get in trouble is to neglect the budget and get into a pattern of spending more than you have    instead incorporate the changes into your budget and plan how you will use the extra income    there is nothing wrong with increasing your spend on non essentials but the purpose of the budget is to keep control of how you do that by keeping track of what you can afford

until you read about someone mentioning one of the main reasons main street took those losses was because of the municipalities state and federal pensions invested into those cdss    credit default swaps were the insurance scams that 's different   municipalities purchased cdos and not   someone correct me if i am wrong   the cds 's were also a problem but of a different sort   cds allowed people to take out insurance on a competing product   imagine me taking out a fire insurance on your house   things like that   cdo = debt obligation this is the paper which represents hundreds of mortgage slices mixed and matched by some bullshit software algorithm that promised to predict risk accurately   cds = credit default swap this is an insurance paper which is not regulated like all the other normal and legitimate insurance that insures the cdo garbage above so if your or even your competitor 's cdo goes into the shitter you can collect on your cds bullshit so the cds was supposed to be a hedge against the cdo failure

a diversified portfolio such as a 60 stocks 40 bonds balanced fund is much more predictable and reliable than an all stocks portfolio and the returns are perfectly adequate the extra returns on 100 stocks vs. 60 are 1.2 per year historically according to to get those average higher stock returns you need to be thinking 20 30 years even 10 years is too short term over the 20 30 years you must never panic and go to cash or you will destroy the higher returns you must never get discouraged and stop saving or you will destroy the higher returns you have to avoid the panic and despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20 30 years the stock market will go nowhere you also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early if you look at dry periods in stocks like 2000 to 2011 a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere a diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money due to rebalancing while a 100 stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit it 's somewhat possible probably to predict dry periods in stocks if i remember the statistics about 50 of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins some funds such as are completely based on this though a lot of money managers consider it with a balanced portfolio and rebalancing though you do n't have to worry about it very much in my view the proper goal is not to beat the market nor match the market nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns instead the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non financial goals such as retirement or buying a house to maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions predictability is more important than maximized returns your results are primarily determined by your savings rate which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it 's too low you can certainly make a projection in which 1.2 difference in returns makes a big difference but you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life where you could have emergency or emotional factors where the market will move and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time end of the 40 years and so on if your plan relies on the extra 1.2 returns then it 's not a reasonable plan anyhow in my opinion since you ca n't count on them so why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all stocks portfolio

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

you have a good point right now the way people raise money at the micro level is hitting up relatives or the boys at the country club   it would be cool if there were local exchanges but i guess the reason there is n't right now is the costs to run such a thing would have to be borne by small companies and investors and it 's cheaper to just raise money informally   but with the internet revolution seems like that would lower the costs somewhat

there is such a thing as deposit only this will allow the individual 's account to function only for collection of monetary deposits   no one will be able to withdraw only deposit   the account holder may still physically withdraw at their banking institution   think of it as taking your account from a public profile to a private profile   doing this is beneficial for ppl who may have been scammed into a program or product where there account is fraudulently or simply to protect your funds from drafted without your approval or despite your requests for the drafts   when making your account a deposit only account it 's a good idea to open a new account at a different banking institution because some banks will still allow an account that is attached to the deposit only account to be drafted from it    with the new account you can utilize that one for paying day to day bills and just transfer funds from the deposit only account to the new account    a deposit only account is also a good way to build up a nice nest egg for yourself or even a young adult financial

first of all since you 're 16 you will not invest in anything you can not you 're a minor you can not enter contracts and as such you can not transact in property your bank accounts are all ugma accounts i.e. your guardian or someone else who 's the trustee on the account will be the one transacting not you you can ask them to do trades but they do n't have to they must make decisions in your best interest which trades may not necessarily be if however they decide to make trades or earn interest or make any other decision that results in gains these are your gains and you will be taxed on them the way taxes work is that you 're taxed on income you 're free to do with it whatever you want but you 're taxed on it so if you realized gains by selling stocks and reinvested them you had income the gains which you did with whatever you felt like reinvested the taxman does n't care what you did with the gains the taxman cares that you had them for losses it is a bit more complicated and while you can deduct losses there are limitations on how much you can deduct and some losses can not be deducted at all when realized like wash sale losses or passive activity losses when you have stock transactions you will probably need to file a tax return reporting the transactions and your gains losses on them you may end up not paying any tax at all but since the broker is reporting the transactions you should too if only to avoid irs asking why you did n't this again should be done by your guardian since you personally can not legally sign documents you asked if your gains can affect your parents taxes not exactly your parents taxes can affect you this is called kiddie tax unofficially of course you may want read about it and take it into account when discussing your investments with your guardian parents if kiddie tax provisions apply to you your parents should probably discuss it with their tax adviser

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

if there are a lot of houses for sale can you be sure that in a year or two you can sell yours how long does the average house in that area stay on the market before it is sold what percentage of houses never get sold   if it ca n't be sold due to the crowded market you will be forced to rent the house the question for you then is how much rental income can you get compare the rental income to your monthly cost of owning and managing the house   one benefit to buying a house in a market that is easy to rent a house would be if you are forced to move quickly then you are n't stuck being 3 months into a 12 month lease   keep in mind that markets can change rather dramatically in just a few years housing costs were flat for much of the 90 's then up in the first half of the last decade and after a big drop they are one a slow climb back up but the actual path they are on depends on the part of the us you are in   the rule of thumb in the past was based on the fact that over a few years the price would rise enough overcome the closing costs on the two transactions unfortunately the slow growth in the 90 's meant that many had to bring checks to closing because the equity gained was n't enough to overcome the closing costs due to low down payment loans    the fast growth period meant that people got into exotic loans to maximize the potential income when prices were going up 10 20 a year   when prices dropped some found that they bought houses they could n't afford but could n't sell to break even on the transaction they were stuck and had to default on the mortgage   in fact i have never seen a time frame when the rule of thumb ever applied
