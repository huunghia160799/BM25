having a good dividend yield does n't guarantee that a stock is safe in the future the company may run into financial trouble stop paying dividends or even go bankrupt for this reason you should never buy a stock just because it has a high dividend yield you also need some criteria to determine whether that stock is safe to buy personally i consider a stock is reasonably safe if it meets the following criteria

serious answer this would be a horrible idea for you so do n't do it   theoretical answer   this gets more complicated   if you are refusing to pay your student loans this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment   you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off     however you also stimulate the economy by buying goods   i 'm just an armchair economist but i would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods   now lets say you never say your not paying of your loans and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods   now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money and you are injecting real money through your payment   so you essentially made more money for the economy   so long as the system believes you can pay of the debt the system is able to hold more money   this is actually why most credit companies want you to pay the minimum balance that and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed

yes if the deceased owned the policy the proceeds are considered part of the estate in the specific case where the estate is worth this year 2011 more than $ 5 m there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill   keep in mind the estate tax itself is subject to change i recall when it was a simple $ 1 m exemption and if i had a $ 1 m policy and just say $ 100 k in assets there would have been tax due on the $ 100k. in general if there 's any concern that one 's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax it 's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

just to add to @duffbeer703 comment additionally the cash value is not part of the death benefit the policy is intended to grow the cash value to the point where it matches the death benefit and then it matures and you get the cash my point being is that since they do n't give you both you are really transferring the from them to you over time your savings that you lose becomes part of the death benefit and they it with less and less over the years so that it would equal the death benefit @duffbeer703 nailed it right on the head buy term and invest the difference and once you 've got your savings built really the need for insurance is n't there any longer if you 've got 1/2 million saved do you really need insurance

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

when you withdraw from your rrsp you lose that contribution room and you will never get it back let 's say you have room to contribute a total of $ 50,000 to rrsps if you withdraw $ 5000 from one institution and deposit it in another you will now have a total contribution room of $ 45,000 this will only matter to you if you hope to max out your rrsp contributions sometime in your life of course but almost everyone should be aiming for this otherwise you are correct your extra income will be mitigated by your immediate to your rrsp note that there are two circumstances where withdrawing from your rrsp does not reduce your contribution limit the home buyers plan lets you withdraw up to $ 25,000 to buy a home you have to repay this over no more than 15 years the second is the lifelong learning plan which lets you withdraw up to $ 20,000 up to $ 10,000 annually to be repaid over a 10-year period any other withdrawals or failure to repay under the hbp or llp will lower your rrsp contribution room in summary it 's almost certainly worth paying the $ 125 fee unless you are certain you will not be maxing out your rrsp contributions in your lifetime

# 245355
i can but it takes a significant amount of time    i 'll do a short version which might leave more holes than you like basically traders do n't want to barter because it is hard to find the person with precisely the goods you want who wants to trade for the goods you have thus the need for coupons that represent value in a marketplace then you need to decide who gets to create coupons if too many can issue them problems arise and no one trusts the coupons will be good later eventually you want one large bank nation trader to be able to issue them so everyone has the same level of trust in them and you do n't have the economic inefficiencies of many coupon issuers   next the number of coupons needs to be enough to facilitate trade if the amount of trade increases a lot and the number of coupons does n't increase similarly they become worth more and people start to hoard them this causes deflation which causes less investment which causes less growth which hurts everyone in the long run    if there are too many coupons added this causes inflation which causes people to spent them quicker instead of holding them for reasons i wo n't cover here slight predictable inflation is much better than deflation so remember inflation is slightly preferred note that inflation is often caused not by the number of coupons but by external price changes   now for a modern economy to do well has to watch the economy measure it carefully and add subtract coupons into the system as needed coupons like all money have no real value whatever that means but only have value because the holder expects to be able to trade them later for goods and services you can not eat coupons use them for shelter usually or wear them but you want to trade them for such needs the same is true for paper money gold stones or almost whatever money system one uses money in all these forms is merely an iou tradable for future goods   the fed is tasked among other things with making sure there is precisely enough coupons in the economy to keep trade functioning as well as possible this is very hard to do since there are external and internal shocks to an economy think disaster foreign shutting off resources rapid changes in people 's tastes etc    central banks such as the fed need to be independent of political control since empirical evidence has shown that politicians tend to add more money to the system than is needed because the short term gains give them votes but the long term consequences rapid inflation unemployment lower economic growth are bad for society this is why the fed is largely out of congressional control and large amounts of empirical evidence across hundreds of years and dozens of cultures shows this to be good   note another function of the fed is to be a lender of last resort to help prevent bank panics that were widespread in the 18th and early 19th century something that none of us now remember but it was a real problem i 'll skip that part for now   so now we 're at the point where the fed needs to add subtract coupons from society to do this part justice takes significant time to cover all the reasons why various rules are in place banking reserve requirements for example and you can not learn it from one pass of reading   but i 'll try instead of being like the majority of internet fools that rail against the system try to learn the why of all this and you 'll be much wiser and understand that it is all a pretty good system   one method they use is the interbank lending rate banks have a reserve requirement which is the ratio of coupons they need to have on hand as a ratio compared to the total coupons depositors lent them this is usually around 1:10 the amount deposited that they can lend goes to business loans school loans mortgage loans etc and helps economies grow now when a bank on a given day falls short due to too many withdrawals other banks or the fed offers an overnight loan to meet reserve requirements and the fed sets the interest rate which in turn drives other interest rates in the system   this does not change the money supply very much   secondly the fed sets the reserve requirement which vastly can change the amount of money available to society but they change this rate so rarely all the historical data is on the st. fed site among others that it is not usually an issue i 'll explain below how this can drastically change the money supply though the money multiplier   thirdly and this is the part the poster above seems upset about they conduct open market operations this is the primary means by which the fed exercises control over the number of coupons in play the government like businesses like individuals often needs to borrow money in theory to invest in wise causes like infrastructure or perhaps money making enterprises such as technology and i know what they often use the money for causes many to complain the government like companies offers the sale of various contracts such as bonds to investors who want a place to park some accumulated coupons for safety and they get a return plus some interest so the government sells bonds on the open market to investors banks pensions foreign governments basically to whomever wishes to purchase them at the market rate and the government like many individuals and banks uses these loans to perform day to day functioning and possible smooth out volatility in spending needs by law the fed can not purchase directly from treasury now once on the market these bonds are traded packaged resold etc since they have inherent value and since those owning them want to buy sell them perhaps before maturity date this liquidity ability to sell your goods is necessary fewer would purchase an item if they could not sell it when they desire thus bonds are bought sold and traded and their prices fluctuate based on what the market thinks they are worth just like any good   now the fed can buy sell these bonds on the open market like anyone else so when the fed wishes to increase the money supply they can buy bonds that are not spendable money and inject money into the system note they now hold a bond that had at the time of transaction the same value as the money they injected note investors freely bought these from treasury meaning the market thought at the time of purchase that this was a good it is not the government merely wishing more money into it is market forces that require more money for trades and is selling goods from the marketplace of presumably equal value to the fed this increases liquidity but takes valuable assets from circulation when the fed wishes to shrink the money supply they sell these bonds back into circulation basically by offering better terms than treasury in fact you can find graphs of the fed operations and see how every december they inject money for more christmas need more coupons for more trade and every january they extract some   so open market transactions buying and selling goods at market prices in the marketplace along with other traders is how the fed injects and removes money from the money supply this is the primary mechanism that the fed uses to control the number of coupons in the economy   finally a little about reserve requirements and the money multiplier since it affects so much of the number of coupons in play this also i must simplify drastically each bank needs to hold 1/10 of all deposits in cash the rest can be lent which lands in another bank which again can be lent etc thus each $ 1 deposited can result in loans totalling 9/10 + + + = 9 more dollars many people claim that banks are printing money which is nonsense since each also has an equal debt to pay to the person they borrowed from when all loans are paid back there is no net money gain   however this allows for each $ 1 the fed injects by buying bonds for there to be up to $ 9 in the economy if banks all loan to the fullest banks tend to want to loan since loaned money makes them profit banks used to loan too much and runs on the banks caused significant problems which is why laws were made to require all banks to have the same reserve requirement   now when banks get scared and stop loaning this 9 fold multiplier dries up and the fed has much less on being able to target the proper number of coupons to keep the economy smooth during the recent crash when banks stopped loaning as each dollar was paid back on debts there was significant of available money for transactions and this kills the economy this is the liquidity crisis    hope this helps as i said this is vastly simplified and i can not go into all the reasons and historical items needed to understand it fully it is a vastly complex and necessarily so and takes significant study to grasp the genius of it it 's similar to not being able to understand nuances of particle physics in one go but as you study and work at it you see why things go as they do and you learn all the failed methods the gold standard is one example that were thrown out for many good reasons   cheers

congratulations on being in this position your problem which i think that you identified is that you do n't know much about investing my recommendation is that you start with three goals the motley fool has a lot of good information on their site their approach may or may not align with what you want to do i 've subscribed to their newsletters for quite a while and have found them useful i 'm what is known as a value investor i like to make investments and hold them for a long time others have different for the second goal it 's very important to follow the money and ask how people get paid in the investment business the real money in wall street is made not by investment but by charging money to those who are in the investment business there are numerous people in line for some of your money in return for service or advice fees for buying selling stocks fees for telling you which stocks to buy sell fees for managing your money etc you can invest without spending too much on fees if you understand how the system works   for the third goal i recommend choosing a few stocks and creating a virtual portfolio you can then then get used to watching and tracking your investments if you want a place to put your money while you do this i 'd start with an s&p 500 index fund with a low expense ratio and i 'd buy it through a discount broker i use scottrade but there are a number of choices   hope that helps

the math works out so that the 401k is still a better deal in the long term over a taxable account because of the tax deferred growth let 's assume you invest in an s&p 500 index fund in either a taxable investment account or a 401k and the difference in fees is .5 i used an online calculator and a hypothetical 1k year investment over 30 years with 4.5 tax deferred growth vs 5 taxable and a 25 tax bracket after 30 years the tax deferred 401k account will have $ and the taxable account will have $ the math is n't perfect i 'm sure i 'm missing some with dividends capital gains distributions and that you 'll then pay income tax on the 401k upon retirement as you drawn down but it still seems pretty clear that the 401k will win in the long run especially if you invest more than the 1k year used in my example but yeah expenses on an index fund is robbery can you bring that to the attention of the hr department maybe they 'll want to look for a lower fee provider and it 's in their best interest too if they also participate

from the comments it sounds like you have a technical background so i 'm going to suggest you think of this as a technical problem it 's an optimization problem where the variable you 're trying to optimize for is total interest paid over the lifetime of the loans step 1 is making sure you 're using the credit available to you most efficiently if there 's room in the credit limit for card 1 to move more of your debt there then definitely move your balances from the higher interest cards however be careful some cards will have different interest rates for balance transfers or cash advances and definitely do n't move any principal from card 3 until the 0 interest rate expires pursuing a bank loan as part of step 1 is valid as well you could start with the bank you use for your checking account today credit unions can be a good source of lower interest loans as well ensure that you fully understand the terms and interest rates particularly if they change just be careful about applying for them too many can affect your credit rating negatively you also mention in the comments that you 're paying her mortgage i do n't know how the ownership is set up there but either refinancing or taking out a home equity loan can be a way to consolidate debt the interest rate on a home loan will almost assuredly be less than on your higher rate cards especially taking the tax deduction into account step 2 is paying down the debt efficiently the rule here is simple pay the minimum payment on all cards except for the one with the highest interest rate any money you have above the minimum payments should go into paying down the principal on that one in your case that 's card 2   good luck

for what its worth i recently closed on a 30 year refinance mortage with an agent i found through zillow   the lender has a perfect reputation score whose office was located within 5 miles of my house and as suggested by justkt on mrchrister 's response i checked out the business on the better business bureau and its online presence prior to going forward with the bank the process was relatively painless and the apr and closing costs were less than my previous loan with a federal credit union which i 've used in the past   i ca n't say if the bank i 'll be using going forward is as good as the one i 've used in the past but overall i 'm quite happy with it i never met the individual in person but this saved both of us a fair amount of time honestly

to me it sounds like you need to come up with 67 k 30 + 37 part of the time you can work in the current job part of the time you could work a lower paying part time job for a year   lets assume that you can earn 15 k for that year and you can save 5 k from your current job   i 'd try and save more but what ever you can do 67 15 5 = 47     i 'd sell the investment property   first you will have some funds to throw at this need second you expense should go down as you do n't have a payment on this property 47 26 = 21   you have 32 k in cash which is a lot for someone in your expense range   six months would be 15 k so i would use some of that cash 21 17 = 4 now you are really close   if needed i 'd use the investments to cover the last 4k or even more of the on hand cash   however could you do something to reduce that amount further like working more

your question is unclear about whether you are moving from bi weekly payments or to bi weekly payments let 's calculate each case bi weekly pay means you will be paid every two weeks the amount for each payment will be your annual salary divided by 26 possibly with a small decrease around 0.3 to account for the fact that years are slightly longer than 52 weeks i.e. there are slightly more than 26 two week periods in a year and possibly an even smaller adjustment to take account of the fact that some years are a day longer than that you will be paid literally every 14 days with some adjustments if a payday falls on a holiday if you are going to be paid twice a month then each payment will be your annual salary divided by 24 typically you are paid on the same days of each month for example the 1st and the or the last business day before those

why it is good to be risky the reason why it is good to be risky is because risky investments can result in higher returns on your money the problem with being risky is there is a chance you can lose money however in the long term you can usually benefit from higher returns even if you have a few slip ups let me show you an example   these two lines are based off of placing $ 2,000 in a retirement fund at age of 20 and then at age of 25 start investing $ 6,500 a year based off of a salary of $ 65,000 with a company that will 1 to 1 match up to 5 ira contribution presumably someone with a master 's should be able to get this and then being able to increase your contribution amount by $ 150 a year as your salary begins to increase as well the blue line assumes that all of this money that you are putting in a retirement account has a fixed 3 interest compounded yearly for simplicity sake every year until you retire the red line is earning a 12 interest rate while you are 20 years old and then decreasing by 0.5 per year until you retire since this is using more risky investments when you are younger i have even gone ahead and included losing 20 of your money when you are 24 another 20 when you are 29 and then again another 20 when you are 34 as you can see even with losing 20 of your money 3 different times you still end up with more money then you would have had if you stuck with a more conservative investment plan if i change this to 50 each 3 times you will still come out about equal to a more conservative investment now i do have these 3 loses placed at a younger age when there is less to lose but this is to be expected since you are being more risky when you are young when you are closer to retirement you have less of a chance of losing money since you will be investing more conservatively why it is ok to be risky when you are young but not old lets say you loose 20 of your $ 2,000 when you are young you have 30 40 years to make that back that 's roughly $ 1 a month extra that you are having to come up with so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are young you have plenty of time to account for it before you retire   now lets say you have $ 1,000,000 when you are 5 years from retiring and loose 20 of it you have to come up with an extra $ a month if you want to retire on time so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are close to retiring you will most likely have to work for many more years just to be able to recover from your loses what to invest in this is a little bit more difficult question to answer if there was one right way to invest your money every one would be doing that one right way and would result in it not turning out to be that good of investment what you need to do is come up with a plan for yourself my biggest advice that i can give is to be careful with fees some places will charge a fixed dollar amount per trade while others might charge a fixed dollar amount per month while even others might charge a percentage of your investment with only having $ 2,000 to invest a large fee might make it difficult to make money

the big question is whether you will be flexible about when you 'll get that house the overall best investment in terms of yielding a good risk return ratio and requiring little effort is a broad index fund mutual or etf especially if you 're contributing continuously and thereby take advantage of cost averaging but the downside is that you have some volatility during an economic downturn your investment may be worth only half of what it 's worth when the economy is booming and of course it 's very bad to have that happening just when you want to get your house then again chances are that house prices will also go down in such times if you want to avoid ever having to see the value of your investment go down then you 're pretty much stuck with things like your high interest savings account which sounds like a very good fit for your requirements

the most important thing to remember is that being vat registered you must add vat to every bill so every bill will be 20 higher if the bill payer is a company they do n't care because they deduct the 20 vat from their own vat bill if the bill payer is a private person their cost of your services has just gone up by 20 and it is going to hurt your business so the question is what kind of customers do you have   but if your customers are companies then the flat rate scheme mentioned above is very little work and puts a nice little amount of extra cash in your pocket suitable if your bills are mostly for your work and not for parts that you buy for the customer and bill them for

the wording of this question is very confusing because primary signer would in ordinary parlance mean the person borrowing the money and the co signer not would mean the one who is guaranteeing the repayment of the loan if the borrower does not pay the co signer is liable for making the payments whose name is on the title of the car who borrowed the money to buy the car is the loan in your name and your son co signed the loan to induce the bank to loan you money to purchase the car or is it the other way around that your son borrowed the money and you co signed the loan in order to induce the bank to loan your son the money if the car title and the loan are in your name are you defaulting on the loan and so your son is making the loan payments that should have come from you or is it that your son borrowed the money to buy the car his name is on the title he is making the payments and you are no longer interested in backing him up in case he defaults and the bank comes after you for the money

basically speaking japanese bank accounts are identified by three numbers the four digit bank number   for example is mitsubishi tokyo bank the three digit branch number for example = main branch for mitsubishi the account number   this is your account number your atm cash card and passbook will have these numbers on it in the format xxxx    when you use an atm to send money to someone else like your landlord you but in these three numbers or use the search feature instead for the first two   this works the same whether you are talking about mitsubishi etc   the only thing to note is that while real banks use locations for the branch number i.e. branch branch etc online only banks like sony bank bank sbi etc use fake locations like colors etc   this does n't matter much though japan post bank is technically not a bank and uses a totally different system though recently they have come up with a strange formula to convert your jp bank account number into a normal bank account number so you can send payments to it as shown above all of this is basically for domestic transfers only though   if you want to transfer money internationally there are two basic ways the official way   go to your bank overseas and give them the swift code and account code for your bank likely the branch code will be necessary as well   the problem here is that they will likely charge a high fee for sending the money and your bank in japan may also charge a high fee for receiving it   in addition to any currency conversion fees   a second problem is that only the very major banks even have swift codes use a money transfer service that can handle both japan and your other country   for example you can use 2 paypal accounts only in the direction of from japan to overseas though or you can use something like either way iban is a european standard and is n't used in japan if you just want to spend some money in japan the most convenient way is probably a foreign visa debit card   or you can use a foreign atm card in japan to withdraw cash and then deposit it into your japanese account

your rate of return for paying off this loan is 9 and that 's guaranteed for reference the best rate of return on a 10-year fdic insured certificate of deposit today is 3 there 's definitely something out there with better returns than paying off your loans but there 's definitely not going to be anything with better risk adjusted returns than paying off your loans investors dream of guaranteed 9 rates of return if you had something that could provide a guaranteed 9 rate of return wannabe investors would be lining up at your door and tripping over each other to outbid each other until it actually closer to a 3 rate of return :p depending on whether your loans are tax deductible and what your inflation expectations are you could adjust those rates to make the comparison more accurate but at 3 vs 9 the picture 's pretty clear

most people will never need to pay federal gift taxes the federal gift taxes start after giving away million over the course of your life this number is adjusted annually for inflation there are only two states that i know of which impose state gift taxes connecticut and minnesota in connecticut you need to start paying taxes if the lifetime value of your gifts exceed two million in minnesota it starts at 1 million   the federal tax is paid for by the person making the gift unless other arrangements are made there is an annual exclusion amount of approximately $ 14,000 you can give up to this amount to any number of recipients and it is not considered taxable therefore when you give $ 100 to someone it is not a taxable event   if you do make a gift to an individual in excess of 14k you 'll need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 when you file form 709 you wo n't need to pay taxes until the million is exceeded instead you can claim an exemption since most people do n't exceed that amount its rare to ever pay taxes even when exceeding the annual exclusion amount the annual exclusion amount is adjusted each year for inflation

great so we agree it 's not a fraud and the title of the bloomberg article is grossly misleading   even still to call it a bubble you 'd need to first agree to what the non bubble valuation of bitcoin would be the consensus among those who use the word tulip frequently when talking about bitcoin is that the non bubble valuation of bitcoin is zero 0   this of course means that bitcoin has been in a bubble ever since the first exchange of good was made with it which tells us was a purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins establishing a price of under $ 0.01 per bitcoin ever since for the past 7 years bitcoin has been in a bubble    furthermore for as long as bitcoin 's market value remains at or above $ 0.01 per bitcoin it will still be in a bubble if me and a few hundred thousand of my closest friends have anything to say about it that will never happen and therefore bitcoin will remain in a bubble indefinitely   now that to me seems like a very unusual bubble if that strikes you as a stretch of the concept too then maybe we need to revisit an assumption or two here   for one is the non bubble valuation of bitcoin really zero is there perhaps something about bitcoin that might give it some intrinsic value that say tulips or babies may not have and if there is is there a way to estimate what that value may be does that value change over time is it perhaps possible that the value of bitcoin correlates in some fashion with its reach and its network effect    those are harder questions to answer and their answers is certainly not as neat and precise as zero or bubble but maybe it 's useful to think about them when trying to reason about what bitcoin is and is n't

there are several brokerages which have lower minimum deposits often $ 500 and allow purchase of index etfs i wo n't name them to avoid advertising the best way to find out is to go to your bank and ask to see a financial advisor then explain your difficulty to the advisor who should caution you about the issues with investing such a small amount and ask for advice on where to find a suitable broker also sometimes banks offer services where you can buy shares of a fund through your bank account this is probably not as good as the brokerage performance may be not as good fees may come out higher but especially for small amounts and for convenience this may be easier again you should inquire at your institution

your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   i 'm just pointing out the stupidity of the statist that the debt is not a problem because we owe it to ourselves like to think we 're all in this together but that 's not reality some people are taking from others by force of law   the debt is owed to banks and they want to keep this system going would n't you like to have a legal monopoly on the supply of currency institutions which are funded by loose credit government academia military contractors crony corporations likewise benefit from this system   those who invest in us dollars and those who are from the central planning are the losers in this scheme    but there is more debt than currency so it ca n't ever be repaid so that is a moot point it ca n't even hypothetically be considered    there are however a number of other ways that this system could unwind when it inevitably does the banks could be left to fail and their assets would be bid on by others through the bankruptcy process or the fed could keep issuing currency to keep the banks solvent eventually inflating the whole system into irrelevance

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

if you made a contribution to a traditional ira for year x whether made during year x or made in year x+1 before the due date of your tax return for year x then you can withdraw the contribution and any gains on that contribution   by the due date of your tax return if the contribution was deductible then of course you must not take a deduction for it in on your tax return for year x or any other year for that matter as for the gains if any that were withdrawn they are taxable income to you for year x not x+1 even if the withdrawal occurred in year x+1 publication says you generally can make a tax free withdrawal of contributions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them this means that even if you are under age 59 1/2 the 10 additional tax may not apply and later in the same publication if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw them tax free by the extended due date you can do this if for each contribution you withdraw both of the following conditions apply      you did not take a deduction for the contribution    you withdraw any interest or other income earned on the contribution you can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the ira when calculating the amount that must be withdrawn     if there was a loss the net income earned on the contribution may be a negative amount later the document says you must include in income any earnings on the contributions you withdraw include the earnings in income for the year in which you made the contributions not the year in which you withdraw them and the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59 1/2 does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to the age 59 1/2 rule it will be subject to this tax since you have a loss on the contributions that you are withdrawing there is no interest or other income that needs to be reported

federal tax refund is taxes you 've overpaid what you 're saying is that this year you overpaid less than before i do n't understand why you see this is as a bad thing optimal situation is when you have no refunds and no taxes due on tax day but it is really hard to get there but the closer you can get the better which means that reducing your refund should be your goal in any case federal tax refund is meaningless what you need to look at is your actual taxes due this is the number you should be working to reduce is it possible to shift the amounts on a w-2 with correct adjustments to tax all of your wages instead of leaving some of it deducted pre tax why would you want to pay more tax if your goal is to have a refund i.e. it is your way of forcing yourself to save then you need to recalculate the numbers and adjust your w4 taking the pre tax fsa into account if it is not the goal then you should be looking at the total taxes owed not the refund and adjust your w4 so that your withholding would cover the taxes owed as closely as possible and to answer your question after all this of course it is possible but it is wrong and will indeed likely to trigger an audit you can write whatever you want on your tax return but in the end of it you sign under the penalty of perjury that what you filled is the correct information perjury is a federal felony and knowingly filing incorrect tax return is fraud especially since your motive is to gain even though you 're not actually gaining anything fraudulent tax returns can be audited any time no statute of limitations

what is a dividend essentially for every share of a dividend stock that you own you are paid a portion of the company ’s earnings you get paid simply for owning the stock for example let ’s say company x pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share most companies pay dividends quarterly four times a year meaning at the end of every business quarter the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents or 5 cents for each share you own this may not seem like a lot but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company you can make a lot of money over the years the key is to reinvest those dividends source what is an ex dividend date once the company sets the record date the ex dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules the ex dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date if you purchase a stock on its ex dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment instead the seller gets the dividend if you purchase before the ex dividend date you get the dividend source that said as long as you purchased the stock before you are entitled to the next dividend if not you 'll get the following one after that

it sounds like the kinds of planners you 're talking to might be a poor fit because they are essentially selling investments for a commission some thoughts on finding a financial planner the good kind of financial planner is going to be able to do a comprehensive plan look at your whole life goals and non investment issues such as insurance you should expect to get a document with a monte carlo simulation showing your odds of success if you stick to the plan for investments you should expect to see a recommended asset allocation and an emphasis on low cost no commission commission is load funds see some of the other questions from past posts for example what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money a good place to start for a planner might be there 's also a franchise of planners providing hourly advice called the planning network i helped my mom hire someone from them and she was very happy though i do think your results would depend mostly on the individual rather than the franchise anyway see they do require planners to be fee only and working on their cfp credential you should really look for the certified financial planner cfp credential there are a lot of credentials out there but many of them mean very little and others might be hard to get but not mean the right thing some other meaningful ones include chartered financial analyst cfa which would be a solid investment expert though not necessarily someone knowledgeable in financial planning generally and irs enrolled agent which means someone who knows a lot about taxes a cpa accountant would also be pretty meaningful a law degree and estate law know how is very relevant to many planning situations too some not very meaningful certifications include certified mutual fund specialist which is n't bogus but it 's much easier to get than cfp or cfa registered investment adviser ria which mostly means the person is supposed to understand securities fraud laws but does n't mean they know a lot about financial planning there are some pretty bogus certifications out there many have retirement or senior in the name a good question for any planner is are you a fiduciary which means are they legally required to act in your interests and not their own most sales oriented advisors are not fiduciaries they would n't charge you a big sales commission if they were and they are not on your side legally speaking it 's a good idea to check with your state regulators or the sec to confirm that your advisor is registered and ask if they have had any complaints small advisors usually register with the state and larger ones with the federal sec if they are registered they may still be a salesperson who is n't acting in your interests but at least they are following the law you can also see if they 've been in trouble in the past when looking for a planner one firm i found had a professional looking web site and did n't seem sketchy at all but the state said they were not properly registered and not in compliance other ideas a good book is it 's very and you 'd feel more confident talking to someone maybe with more background information for companies to work with stick to the ones that are very consumer friendly and sell no load funds vanguard is probably the one you 'll hear about most but t. rowe price fidelity usaa are some other good names fidelity is a bit of a mixture with some cheap consumer friendly investments and other products that are less so avoid companies that are all about charging commission pretty much anyone selling an annuity is probably bad news annuities have some valid uses but mostly they are a bad deal not knowing your specific situation in any detail it 's very likely that 60k is not nearly enough and that making the right investment choices will make only a small difference you could invest poorly and maybe end up with 50 k when you retire or invest well and maybe end up with 80 90k but your goal is probably more like a million dollars or more and most of that will come from future savings this is what a planner can help you figure out in detail it 's virtually certain that any planner who is for real and not a ripoff salesperson will talk a lot about how much you need to save and so forth not just about choosing investments do n't be afraid to pay for a planner it 's well worth it to pay someone a thousand dollars for a really thorough fiduciary plan with your interests foremost the free planners who get a commission are going to get a whole lot more than a thousand dollars out of you even though you wo n't write a check directly be sure to convert those mutual fund expense ratios and sales commissions into actual dollar amounts to summarize find someone you 're paying not someone getting a commission look for that cfp credential showing they passed a demanding exam maybe read a quick and easy book like the one i mentioned just so you know what the advisor is talking about and do n't rush into anything and btw i think you ought to be fine with a solid plan you and your husband have time remaining to work with good luck

hmm this would seem to be impossible by definition   the definition of an index fund is that it includes exactly the stocks that make up the index once you say except for then what you want is not an index fund but something else it 's like asking can i be a vegetarian but still eat beef umm no there might be someone offering a mutual fund that has the particular combination of stocks that you want resembling the stocks making up the index except with these exclusions that would n't be an index fund at that point but etc there are lots of funds out there with various ideological criteria i do n't know of one that matches your criteria i 'd say search for the closest approximation you can find you could always buy individual stocks yourself and create your own pseudo index fund depending on how many stock are in the index you are trying to match and how much money you have to invest it may not be possible to exactly match it mathematically if you would have to buy fractions of shares if the number of shares you had to buy was very small you might get killed on broker fees and i 'll upvote 's answer for being a pretty close approximation to what you want

gt;if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   the costs depend very very very much on who the people in the pool are actuarial data shows that older people almost invariably and by definition have significantly higher costs ergo this is why their premiums have been higher or if a particular pool has an inordinate number of older people in it why everyone in that pool 's premiums are higher because they are essentially an average and the younger members are in essence subsidizing the older ones conversely if a firm has almost entirely young single people premium costs are significantly significantly lower   one of the things the legislation does though is place an artificial limitation of the premium price differential ergo younger people will across the board be seeing a huge increase in premium costs because the law is essentially mandating a major increased operating loss on the older pool members the cost will be shifted to the younger people   end result is that premiums for younger people will increase several times over which will make buying a policy which in the past was relatively cheap for young amp healthy people a significantly more difficult burden and that will naturally make paying the fine far more financially pragmatic   this is especially true since the other provision of the law is that known pre existing conditions can not be used to exclude or change the premium cost so should the individual be diagnosed with something they can after the fact still purchase coverage   basically it is like being able to buy a lottery ticket after the number have been drawn   it is an inherently unstable and unsustainable system

that does n't make it the perfect medium for theft the system makes it okay to make non controversial items because its not like someone is going to put in the effort to track you for that    yet if you are buying something illicit a large part of the blockchain can already be analyzed to see where stuff is coming from and they can start work from there    for example let 's say you buy off local bitcoin well even if the fbi does n't know your address or who it belongs to they monitor the site and know that the funds came from a certain account they know this because that certain someone bought coins from a regulated company    its not the perfect medium for theft at all do you actually research bitcoin or are you just looking for any reason not to like it its really much more complex grand than most make it out to be

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

it would be very unusual and very erroneous to have a company 's stock be included in the long term investments on the balance sheet   it would cause feedback loops which would create financial documents and stock prices   that 's how your question would be interpreted if true   this is not the case stock prices are never mentioned on the financial documents   the stock price you hear being reported is information provided by parties who are not reporting as part of the company   the financial documents are provided by the company   they will be audited internally and externally to make sure that they can be presented to the market stock prices are quoted and by brokers at the stock exchange or equivalent service   they are negotiated and the latest sale tells you what it has sold for   what price this has been reported never works its way onto the financial document so what use are stock prices are for those within the company   the stock price is very useful for guessing how much money they can raise by issuing stock or buying back stock   raising money is important for expansion of the company or to procure money for when avenues of debt are not optimal buying back stock is important if major shareholders want more control of the company

in the netherlands specifically there are several reasons to pay extra off on your mortgage first house prices have dropped significantly in the last several years   they are rising slowly now but it 's region specific and you can still borrow more than 100 of the price of the house   under these conditions if you choose to sell your house and the outstanding mortgage amount is greater than the value of your house you are left with a gap to finance   i think the rules have changed recently around this allowing you to finance this gap with a new mortgage but this is not a good idea   the tax implications of this are likely to be complicated in the long run and your new house may not cover this gap for some time second the less you owe on your house the lower mortgage rates you can get   mortgages in the netherlands usually fall into categories based on percentage of the auction price at a foreclosure sale   if you pay more of your mortgage off you may qualify for a lower interest rate possibly making refinancing interesting   this is especially important if interest rates continue to drop but the value of your house does not increase or even decreases third if you choose to keep your house and rent it out the banks in the netherlands have very strict rules on this if you want to do it above board   i 've read that some banks require the mortgage amount nb not the value you may have built up in a linked savings or insurance account to be less than 50 of the foreclosure auction price   also related to point 2 if you have something other than a linear or annuity mortgage you will need to refinance to do this as the tax advantages around savings mortgages do not apply if it is not used as your own residence finally if you choose to sell and you are in the happy position of having the value of your house be greater than the value of your mortgage you have an there may still be some obstacles   any value you have accumulated in a linked savings or life insurance account is not available until after you sell your house   extra value derived purely from the difference between mortgage value and sale price may be easier to deal with edit as a final note i 've made extra payments on both a linked life insurance and a linked savings account   in one the principal paid each month reduced and the mortgage lifetime stayed the same   in the other the principal paid each month stayed the same and the lifetime reduced   in both cases interest payments were less each month   i would contact your mortgage provider to understand what the expected impact of extra payments will be

we do n't make enough to really consider it a salary but i 've heard    using a draw without a salary is a bad idea as any other illegal action not paying yourself a   reasonable salary when being a corporate officer is indeed a bad idea i have no idea what i need to do to actually get some money in our    pockets the answer is simple you need to earn more money since it is s corp it does n't matter if you keep the profits on the corporate account or distribute the profits will be taxed to you you are also as i said above required by law to pay yourself a reasonable salary reasonable meaning corresponding to market rates paying a cpa or a software engineer a minimum wage will not be reasonable that is of course if you 're profitable you 're not required to pay yourself more money than the corporation actually has just to be clear my answer refers to the question asked and the confusing answer above that made a claim that has no in the law i do not intend to write a thesis about pros and cons of using s corp every time a question about reasonable salary is asked

there are some good answers about the benefits of diversification but i 'm going to go into what is going on mathematically with what you are attempting i was always under the assumption that as long as two securities are less than perfectly correlated i.e. 1 that the standard deviation risk would be less than if i had put 100 into either of the securities while there does exist a minimum variance portfolio that is a combination of the two with lower vol than 100 of either individually this portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio with highest utility under your metric   your metric includes returns not just volatility variance so the different returns bias the result away from the min vol portfolio using the utility function results in the highest utility of 100 vtsax so here the sharpe ratio risk adjusted return of the u.s. portfolio is so much higher than the international portfolio over the period tracked that the loss of returns from adding more international stocks outweigh the lower risk that you would get from both just adding the lower vol international stocks and the diversification effects from having a correlation less than one the key point in the above is over the period tracked   when you do this type of analysis you implicitly assume that the returns risk observed in the past will be similar to the returns risk in the future    certainly if you had invested 100 in the u.s. recently you would have done better than investing in a mix of us intl   however while the risk and correlations of assets can be somewhat stable over time relative returns can vary wildly this uncertainty of future returns is why most people use a diversified portfolio of assets   what is the exact right amount is a very hard question though

the best thing to do is to completely pay off one credit card then apply the left over to the highest interest card after that all of your expenses that can be put on a credit card should be put on the one that you just paid off at the end of the month pay off a different credit card and the highest interest and move all your purchasing to that card keep going around the circle until you are able to pay them all off doing this will be good for your credit score as the debt on the cards will now be new   if you 're really desperate to increase your credit score e.g. refinancing a house you can use balance transfers to temporarily make it appear that you have zero debt but it will cost you some money typically balance transfers cost something like $ 35 + 2

my experience is in economics so it may differ from an accounting or personal finance perspective somewhat that being said i find it perfectly acceptable to use a term like cagr when the rate is positive or negative economists talk about negative growth rates all the time and it 's universally assumed that growth rates can be positive or ideally the actual magnitude and sign of the value should be specified by the value itself the term whether it 's growth rate some modified version of it like cagr or any label in a table or on a graph should describe the calculation or source used obtain the value i should n't need the name to indicate the sign of the number if the number is present the name is only there to help me understand the value unfortunately i do n't know of any specific term that represents the geometric averaging nature of cagr and also eliminates the minor potential for semantic confusion however i think the minor problem of semantics needs to be balanced against the tradeoff of using a different term that is n't as common if one were to exist cagr is a standard well known term that a allows someone who is familiar with the term to instantly understand the procedure you 're using and b allow someone who is n't familiar with it to quickly search and find an explanation since searching for cagr will numerous simple explanations of how it 's calculated 1 this is different from the concept of economic growth which is usually assumed to be positive in informal discussions in economic modeling many of the first steps in creating a model are symbolic anyway so growth rate change in output and economic growth are used interchangeably to describe changes in gdp because the values either are n't known irrelevant until later in the project or pulled from data that describes it using one or several of the previously stated terms

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

that s a very open question depends on the risk you are willing to take with the money or the length of time you are willing sit on it or if you have a specific goal like buying a house   some banks offer rate savings accounts with a switching bonus that could be a good start combining the nationwide and regular saver if you want something more long term safe option is bonds medium risk option is index funds kind of covers all 3 risks really risky option is stocks shares for these probably a isa for a tax efficient option also lisa or htb isa are worth considering if you want to buy a house in the future

limit books are managed by exchanges if an order is not immediately filled it is sent to the book   from there orders are generally executed on price time priority   the one major exception is the precedence hide not slide orders have over earlier placed visible limit orders since orders are treated like a modification cancellation to an exchange a modification is the same as a cancellation since it charges no fees for placing or canceling orders only for trades   the timestamp is reset and price time priority is applied in the same way so if a modified order is n't immediately filled it is sent back to the book to be filled in order of price time priority

thanks for including a summary for lurkers in your comment i did n't realize how quickly i was responding and i did not know you edited i appreciate you not letting me look ridiculous to browsers   to change course a little bit i 'd like to talk to the idea that if successful people deserve success unsuccessful people must deserve their lot also   outside of money the biggest thing i think we will leave to our kids is what we have learned about money nutrition health and social interaction nothing we know is secret knowledge but at the same time these are fields that are not taught to competence in school and plenty of advertise nonsense that make it difficult to quickly learn what makes sense    if you 're a 25 year old guy making 35 40k and you eat at subway because it is endorsed by the american heart association and you assume it 's healthy and you spend 30 of your pre tax income on a house because your mortgage broker said that 's normal and your financial advisor said houses are assets and you buy what you like on credit cards and pay monthly minimums and you take out an auto lease or a 6 year loan on a purchase to keep payments low and you diversify what little you have left into mutual funds and bonds you are doing two things you are acting like a totally responsible young adult according to societal norms and people who are supposed to give you advice and you are totally fucking yourself you are yourself with debt you are n't investing in yourself you 're your money 's ability to help you live a life you actually want to live and you are yourself to monthly payments that limit your ability to make choices about what you want and how you want to live    is that your fault you followed common wisdom and your trusted advisors unless you happen to see a different way or someone comes along and tells you otherwise you may never know what opportunities you could 've had i 'll even concede that having the opportunity to think differently may be luck   but here is where i have a point of contention what if you 've concluded generational wealth is simply luck by the time you have someone try to show you differently you may dismiss your opportunity as bullshit and remained trapped in the standard american day to day wage debt slavery this is why i hate these semantics so much i think they rob people of their opportunities

i 'm sorry   but no   it is not   some simple theories can be predictive in the current   but macroeconomic theories are almost never predictive and always more reminiscent of a religion   science must be predictive by definition   but predictions about complex systems are notoriously   this is why your ca n't predict more than a few days out     it 's because it 's impossible   the system is too complex   it is sensitive to initial conditions which are unknown and unknowable   and the inputs are too numerous and varied to account for everything   but they can be accurate to within a given confidence interval even if it does not achieve formal statistical significance   and they can run something akin to what economists would call monte carlo simulations given their models   but so far as macroeconomics go there is no admission by many practitioners in many schools about the predictive limitations on the whole endeavor based on the complex nature of the system   there are simply constructed theoretical frameworks which are not predictive but which seem to have fit certain patterns in the past that are cherry picked to confirm a hypothesis   if that is science it is bad science   this does not mean one can not have an untested hypothesis   economists generally can not set up their own experiments after all   and they deal in complexity and human decision just like the other social scientists   but economists perhaps more so than other social scientists due to the increased mathematical skill set in the standard tool box of the field tend to overstate their case   this is particularly true for those larger named economists in the field who inevitably get hired by major media companies   if friedman and were both scientists how did they come to such widely different conclusions     how does the university of chicago predict and prescribe the polar opposite of u. mo st. louis    basing any theory on splitting one half of 's theory of rationality from the other and assigning the behavioral patterns to actors already makes several cognitive leaps   and yes in the last few years we have had the school of behavioral economics and bounded rationality models to try to cope with this   but it 's still far from predictive   the austrians are certainly on some of the ground in my view   at least keynes work was rigorous   so was marx 's for that matter   that stands in stark contrasts to the austrians and their ilk   but regardless when dealing with essentially contested concepts consensus through induction becomes the only path forward   empirical deduction falls off the menu   the schools of biology and chemistry at u mo and u will not come to opposite conclusions given identical data   the schools of economics do   that in and of itself is anecdotal evidence of a severe flaw in the science in a very sense   and so i stand by my statement

this is dependent on the broker according to the options industry council   your broker will specify what they would do upon expiry or hours before last trade if you did not indicate your preference most likely they will conduct a probabilistic simulation to see whether exercising the contracts may result in margin deficit even after selling the delivered shares under extreme circumstances in most cases brokers tend to liquidate the option for you sell to close before expiry   i 've seen people complain about certain brokers forcing liquidation at terrible bid ask spreads even though the options are still days to expiry it is better for you to close the position on your own beforehand the best brokers would allow margin deficit and let you deposit the required amount of money afterward   please consult your broker 's materials if you ca n't find them use live chat or email tickets

perfect really needed an eli5 scenario   so correct me if i 'm wrong what this means is having an npv of zero of an investment shows that you will be definitely breaking even and that 's better than just having your money lying around doing nothing   now let 's take a pe example why is it that they prefer having an irr of 20 or more why not less    is it because 20 takes care of the cost of capital and more i.e. if your irr is greater than your cost of capital it means that all the outflows from the cost of capital still result in an npv of zero   but if your irr is less than your cost of capital that means you 'll make a loss correct   thanks for your time on this

you seem to be assuming that etfs must all work like the more traditional closed end funds where the market price per share tends based on supply and demand to significantly deviate from the underlying net asset value per share the assumption is simplistic what are traditionally referred to as closed end funds cefs where unit creation and redemption are very tightly controlled have been around for a long time and yes they do often trade at a premium or discount to nav because the quantity is inflexible yet what is generally meant when the label etf is used despite cefs also being both exchange traded and funds are those securities which are not just exchange traded and funds but also typically have two specific characteristics a that they are based on some published index and b that a mechanism exists for shares to be created or redeemed by large market participants these characteristics facilitate efficient pricing through arbitrage essentially when large market participants notice the price of an etf diverging from the value of the shares held by the fund new units of the etf can get created or redeemed in bulk the divergence quickly as these participants buy or sell etf units to capture the difference so the persistent premium sometimes dear or discount sometimes deep one can easily witness in the cef universe tend not to occur with the typical etf much of the time prices for etfs will tend to be very close to their net asset value however it is n't always the case so proceed with some caution anyway both cef and etf providers generally publish information about their funds online you will want to find out what is the underlying net asset value nav per share and then you can determine if the market price trades at a premium or a discount to nav assuming little difference in an etf 's price vs. its nav the more interesting question to ask about an etf then becomes whether the nav itself is a bargain or not that means you 'll need to be more concerned with what stocks are in the index the fund tracks and whether those stocks are a bargain or not at their current prices i.e. the etf is a basket so look at each thing in the basket of course most people buy etfs because they do n't want to do this kind of analysis and are happy with market average returns even so sector based etfs are often used by traders to buy or sell entire sectors that may be undervalued or overvalued

gt 66 of the extra co2 in the air is not from western countries   note that the data is spun to reach this conclusion   the argument behind the data docs   gt one can conclude that only a small fraction of the extra co2 released 100 years ago is still in the air   so basically this number comes from an assumption that 1 pound of china 's emissions today is the same as about 10 pounds of emissions from western countries in 1900   the end result is a total responsibility count that puts more weight on current emissions over historic emissions   of course the author is trying to push an anti alarmist agenda here   if you 're going to calculate responsibility with a heavier weight on current emissions then it also makes sense to divide by current population to get responsibility per capita   now i wonder why the author did n't consider that

you 're certainly still responsible to pay what you owe the company given that 1 for whatever reason the recipient never received the checks and 2 the money was credited back to you albeit in a less than timely manner however if you take the time to explain the situation to the business and show them proof that you sent the payments i would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan also if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened this is really a perfect example though of why balancing your checking account is as important today as it ever was

normally that is the address of the person that wrote the check = the person who is paying the money (= your address if you write the check in this example it is main street you mail the check to the recipient the person who gets the money his name is supposed to be in the line pay to the order of but it does normally not contain any address just a name in this example the recipient is sample company the check does not carry the recipient 's address anywhere only the envelope has it if you are sending someone money you will have to ask them where to send it to   some checks have the bank 's name printed on the top right but that has no influence it is basically an advertisement your bank name

most of this advice applies to the uk where i work in motor insurance pricing for a large personal lines insurer but a lot of it is more general a loyal customer is usually an overpaying customer the guiding most financial services companies go by is that there 's no point rewarding loyalty except to create it where none exists i.e. by giving massive discounts to desirable new customers   shop around every time your policy comes up for renewal and whenever your circumstances change never allow your policy to automatically renew you may be charged a higher premium by default if you do phone up your current insurer and haggle to see if they can beat the best quote you find their agents will usually be able offer a discount if applicable in your country use price comparison websites use at least two different insurers sometimes offer different rates on different sites competing harder on some than on others especially if the price comparison website happens to be owned by one of the insurance companies that quotes on it one example of this is which is owned by rsa group a major insurer if there are no price comparison websites for your country try purchasing your policy through a broker they 'll get quotes from a panel of insurers and offer you the cheapest they can be especially helpful if you have a problematic driving history e.g. drink driving convictions as many mainstream insurers will decline to quote for such people other suggestions chris rea 's answer is a good starting point but i would disagree about cutting back on cover in the uk at least many insurers often charge an equal or greater amount for lower levels of cover because the people who choose these policies tend to be worse risks re switching vehicles a cheap old car will not necessarily be much cheaper to insure than a new expensive one as you can still people with it or crash into other people 's cars and the newer car will probably have better safety features however a less powerful and smaller vehicle typically poses less of a threat to others and will therefore be cheaper to insure another tactic not mentioned so far is reverse fronting fronting where the main driver poses as an additional driver and a less risky driver as the main driver is illegal but the reverse adding a less risky driver as an additional driver is legal and can sometimes reduce premiums this is because only one of you can drive the car at any one time and sometimes it 'll be the less risky one so especially if you 're male and aged < 25 see if adding your safest parent as a named driver makes a difference if you have the choice of storing your car on a driveway or on the street get quotes for both and see which is cheaper if you live in an area where is commonplace thieves are more likely to steal cars left on driveways as they can break into the owner 's home and steal the keys if not the driveway is better as it reduces the risk of a collision if you have previously driven another vehicle e.g. motorbike or or if you 've been insured as an additional driver on someone else 's car call up insurers directly and ask if they can offer you a no claims bonus for this quotes from price comparison websites tend to limit you to the numbers of years of no claims you 've accrued as a main driver and may not reflect your full available no claims bonus extreme measures some insurers give you the option to install a tracking device in your car that can tell them various things e.g.   some people may be uncomfortable sharing this much information with their insurer but for particularly risky drivers i 'm looking at you males < 25 it can sometimes result in a substantial saving one insurer that offers this is finally if every insurer you can find is quoting in excess of £ 10,000 for a year 's cover you may find it cheaper instead to purchase a vintage agricultural vehicle and get it covered on a specialist farmer 's policy

suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy figure out what it will cost to repair your car if necessary pay a garage to evaluate it as if your daughter was interested in buying it then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems if the answer is yes fixing it us probably your most cost effective choice even if it is a big bill if the answer is no consider a used car and again have the mechanic check it for any horrors before committing to buy it that avoids the line tax where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership an almost toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car costs much less and realistically has about the same expected life span i bought a new car once at about $ 300 over the dealer 's real as opposed to sticker cost since i was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year thank you consumer reports for providing the dealer 's cost info and making this a five minute transaction if it had n't suffered flood damage i 'd probably still be driving it and even so i sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine if you really plan to drive it until it is completely you may be able to justify a new car but realistically buying a or two year old car would have been a better choice

a the credit rating agencies only look at the month end totals that are on your credit card as this is all they ever get from the issuing bank so a higher usage frequency as described would not make any direct difference to your credit rating b the issuing bank will know if you use the credit with the higher frequency but it probably has little effect on your limit typically after two to three month they reevaluate your credit limit and it could go up considerably if you never and at this time it could indirectly positively affect your credit rating you could consider calling the issuing bank after two month and try to explain the history a bit and get them to increase the limit but that only makes sense if your credit score has recovered your business paperwork could go a long way to convince someone if you do so well now c if your credit rating is still bad you need to find out why it should have normalized to a medium range with the bad historic issues dropped

is there any practical reason to hold off on making payments until i receive a billing statement yes a few    as for a zero balance fico consumer affairs manager barry says the idea here is the lower the better in terms of the utilization percentage but something is better than nothing the score wants to see some kind of activity   how low should you go in a recent interview fico spokesman craig watts said if your utilization is 10 percent or lower you 're in great shape as far as utilization goes that being said there are downsides especially if you wind up forgetting to make a payment   the easiest thing to do also from a time management perspective is to get your billing statement once a month verify the purchases on it and at that time you receive the statement schedule an online bill payment so that it will be paid in full before the due date    as aganju points out you do n't have to wait for a paper bill in hand or even an e mail notification you can go online after your statement date to get the statement   this makes sure you wo n't have extra costs related to of mail if you still receive paper mail though it does require remembering to check and/or setting a recurring calendar reminder   paying much in advance of that as is your current practice might be a good idea to free up available balance if you are planning a purchase that would take you over your credit limit but this should be relatively rare and some credit card companies will raise that limit if you have been paying well and ask nicely though find out first if they do a hard pull of your credit report for that

inflation is an attempt to measure how much less money is worth it is a weighted average of some bundle of goods and services price 's increase   money 's value is in what you can exchange it for so higher prices means money is worth less monthly inflation is quoted either as a year ending on that month or since the previous month   as the values differ by more than a factor of 10 you can usually tell which one is being referred to when they say inflation in august was 0.4 a record high or inflation in august was 3.6   you do need some context of the state of the economy and how surprised the people talking about the numbers are   sometimes they refer to inflation since the last month and then annualize it which adds to the confusion consumer inflation 's value depends on what the basket of goods is and what you define as the same good   is a computer this year the same as the last   if the computer is 10x faster do you ignore that or factor it in what basket do you use   the typical monthly consumables purchased by a middle class citizen   by a poor citizen   by a rich citizen   a mixture and if so which mixture more detailed inflation figures can focus on inflation facing each of the population by household income split durable goods from non durable goods from services split wage from non wage inflation ignore volatile things like food and energy etc inflation does n't directly cause prices to raise instead it is a measure of how much raise in prices happened   it can easily be a self as inflation expectations can lead to everyone automatically increasing the price they charge for everything wages goods etc inflation can be viewed as a measurement of the cost of holding cash   at 10 inflation per year holding a million dollars in cash for a year costs you 100,000 $ in buying power   at 1 inflation it costs   at 0.1 inflation inflation of 10 in one year followed by 10 the next adds up to 1.1 1.1 1 = 21 inflation over the two years   for low inflation numbers this acts a lot like adding the further from 0 you get the more the lower order terms make the result larger   1 inflation for two years adds up to 10 over two years 21 100 over two years 300 1000 over two years 12000 etc   and yes some places suffer 1000 inflation

only if your work on the side is making you at least £ 60,000 profit a year the overheads are just not worth it if you make less working as a sole trader you can still claim for expenses incurred in the course of your business you can also claim a percentage of your computer costs even though you may use the computer for gaming this is not unreasonable as the computer is necessary for your work the inland revenue accept the fact that some assets are part work related in your case as a web and mobile phone developer i expect the percentage to be at least half if not a lot more if you need to travel in the course of your work you can claim a percentage for your car you can include other small expenses such as telephone electricity etc but do n't go overboard the important point to remember is that you must be able to defend the expenses claimed as work related so long as you can do this there is no problem remember to keep good records of all your expenses this is on going throughout the year and is much more work than filling out your tax return the software on the ir self assessment site is excellent so it 's conceivable that you may not need an accountant if you are prepared to do your own tax return however if you feel unsure employ an accountant initially and take it from there

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

do not directly create value for the company   oh my of course they do now i ca n't say that all of them do there are certainly bad managers out there that destroy value but it 's management 's goal to organize the labor and resources in the most efficient way possible thus creating value if you put 100 workers in a factory and leave them alone for a week they 're not going to know what the hell to do they need someone to direct them and make sure they stay the course an entrepreneur is needed to create a business model that inputs land labor and capital and outputs a product or service that people want

there are only two ways to increase your savings you are young and both of these are likely to happen you will be promoted and get raises and your loans will be paid off removing the loan payment it would seem that you need only to wait a year or so and there will a lot more than $ 87 left over each month and your savings will grow almost without any action from you but somehow that is not what happens in real life as people get older they need more than they did before larger home more expensive things etc and they never manage to get around to saving so it 's great that you are wondering how to do it but you are not truly making it a priority you mention that you also pay spend for friends the internet play joy cloth gifts book etc and this entirely optional spending is the difference between such precision and 90 of your salary in other words it is 17 18 or more than your rent think about that for a moment every month you spend more than your rent on friends play joy books and good old etc if you were to cut that in half you could save 8 or 9 of your salary maybe after your next raise you can get that up to 10 how can you cut that optional fun stuff in half well i do n't know because i do n't know what it is and i suspect you do n't either so track it for a month or two are you getting takeout food or coffee every day are you always the one who pays when you go out with friends do you eat in restaurants a lot do you always wear the latest buy $ 500 shoes pay people to do your nails or dye your hair buy a new phone every year have the top end phone plan top end cable plan you have to know where that worth of money goes every month then you can figure out how to send some of it to savings instead   in some ways you are in a hard generation your parents did n't need to save for their retirement because they had you and they know you will send money home for them but you probably do n't expect the same from the children you do n't have yet so you have to save for yourself this is a challenge if you were saving the money you send your parents you 'd be fine yet you do n't want to reduce what you send they need it still people have faced bigger challenges and overcome them start by understanding where your fun money is going then look at how to send some aim for half of that to savings instead you wo n't regret it

i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

the short answer is it depends the longer answer is that balance transfers are tricky and often a bait and switch they 'll offer 0 interest but charge a 3 4 fee which is n't interest and is perfectly legal on the amount transferred if you transfer $ 5000 you now owe the new card company $ now that could be fine with you at an 18 20 apr on your old card you may have been charged that much in just one or two months and by capitalizing this fee up front you lock in 0 for a year however there are other possible machinations behind the scenes for instance you may incur retroactive interest on the full balance if not paid off in the year at 20 apr on $ 5000 that 's an extra grand you will owe if there 's even one dollar of the original transferred balance left in the account paying off the balance and thus avoiding these penalties has actually been made harder by the card act which required creditors to apply any payment made to the highest interest portion of the balance first as balance transfers are 0 they are the last on the list so if you transfer a balance and then carry an additional balance you are setting yourself up for failure you must have a zero dollar balance for one month sometime during the year in order to be sure the balance transfer is paid off and no penalties will be incurred that can be hard because 5 grand is a lot to pay off to pay off a $ 5000 balance in 12 months requires payments of $ miss one and you 'll have to make it up over the remaining months if you transferred a balance you probably did n't have $ to pay to the card in the first place in summary balance transfers can work but you have to understand all of the terms and conditions and what will happen should you violate any of them if you do n't understand what you 're getting into you could very well end up worse than you started

because the returns are not good one of the big drivers in australia is negative gearing if your investment loses money you can offset losses against your tax on other income institutional investors and corporations are in the business of making money not losing it housing market investors are betting that these year to year revenue losses will ultimately be made up in a big capital gain for which individuals get a huge tax break that is also not available to corporations capital gains are not guaranteed australia has benefited from 25 + years of economic employment and wages growth a result of good government planning strong corporate governance and a fair slice of luck if this were to end housing prices would plateau at best and crash at worst a person who has negative cash flow investments has to sell them urgently if they lose their job a glut of mortgagee sales and property prices could easily come off 20 30 rental yields on residential property in sydney are about 4 with a capital gain of currently 10 but this has been flat or negative within the last 5 years and no doubt will be again within the next 5 rental yields for residential property are constrained by mortgage rates if it significantly cheaper to buy then to rent why would anyone rent in contrast industrial and commercial property gets a yield of about 7 and gets exactly the same capital gain this is because land is land and if the   price of industrial land does n't grow at the same rate as the residential land next door eventually one will be converted into the other retail rentals are even higher in addition commercial tenants are responsible for more outgoings and have fewer legal rights than residential tenants further individual residential properties are horribly illiquid and have large transaction costs while it is possible to bundle them up into property trusts so that units can be sold on the stock exchange it is far more common to do this with office and retail buildings this is what companies like and amp capital do notwithstanding heavily geared property trusts can get into deep water because of the illiquid nature of property as the failure of   illustrates that said there are plenty of companies that develop residential houses and units for sale to owner or investors because that 's where the money is

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

in other words to a first order approximation the s&p 500 is always at an all time high i 'm going to run with this observation a bit the crash of 87 was remarkable it was a drop of 1/3 in a short time yet when one looked at the year the dow was up nearly 5 with dividends included a one year rip van would have up thinking it an year   i actually recall a conversation i had on aug 25th 1987 i was discussing the market with a colleague over lunch and while i did n't call the top that day i remarked that it did n't matter much that 5 10 years later just staying in the market would have been the right thing     compare this 87 95 chart to the longer term chart shows in his chart this is all but a blip in my chart you can see it took about 3 1/2 years to be in the black as the market then shot up from there a dollar cost would not have bought at that short term high well not more than a tiny bit   the best i can do to conclude is to say i 'd never just buy in all at once you buy in over time x% of your income each month and if you have a chunk to invest smooth it out over a few years

i believe you may be missing the point here it they do n't really verify this that before bofa took over the loan the homeowners were not using an escrow account i know this is possible because i had the option of using one or not when i bought my house so it seems that once bofa took over they automatically created an escrow account and when the normal payments the homeowners were making did n't cover the total monthly balance they took it out of the payment specifically for the mortgage    so according to this story its not sensational bullshit this would be the bank creating an issue that is according to the facts that are presented in the article which may not be the whole story   spelling amp grammar

if you invest in a foreign bank you are subject to their financial rules and regulations if you put your money with their cd it will be converted to and you will be paid back in which introduces the exchange rate risk   fdic is not the only reason why a cd in a us bank pays a lower interest but it could be seen as a contributing factor   it all comes down to risk and what the bank is willing to pay for your money when a bank issues a cd they are entering the debt market and competing against other banks governments or anyone looking for money if the yield from lending to one bank is the same as the yield of another the logical choice would be whichever loan is less risky so in order for the riskier bank to receive loans they must entice investors by offering a greater rate of return in addition if a bank is n't looking for loans they might be less inclined to pay for them see what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do if your looking to invest in the cd 's of foreign banks i would suggest doing research on their regulations especially if and how your money is protected in the event the bank goes bust

generally in international transfers there are 4 banks involved customer 's bank customer who initiating the payment also called sender bank there is sender 's correspondent bank then there is beneficiary bank also called receiver bank bank where beneficiary holds account there is receiver 's correspondent bank so person a- > a 's bank > a 's correspondent bank > b 's correspondent bank > b 's bank > person b. depending on the currency at times there is only one correspondent bank the chain of correspondent bank is common knowledge and quite often if you do n't provide all the details your bank or other bank will fill in default details and processes the payments however it all depends on which bank and whether they are inclined to do so some bank specifically insist to use a preferred correspondent bank so if you do n't specify any they may return reject it

the first 3 are the same as owning stock in a company would be measured in shares and would constitute some percentage of the overall shares outstanding if there are 100 shares in the company in total then owning 80 shares is owning 80 is the same as owning 80 of the common stock this would be the typical ownership case though there can also be restricted stock as something to note here convertible debt would likely carry interest charges as well as the choice at the end of becoming stock in the company in this case until the conversion is done the stock is n't issued and thus is n't counted taking the above example one could have a note that could be worth 10 shares but until the conversion is done the debt is still debt some convertible debt could carry options or warrants for the underlying stock as there was the berkshire convertible notes years ago that carried a negative interest rate that was studied in the negative coupon bond if you want an example here options would have the right but not the obligation to buy the stock where there are incentive stock options to research this in more depth in this case one could choose to not exercise the option and thus no stock changes hands this is where some companies will experience dilution of ownership as employees and management may be given options that put more shares out to the public issuing debt would n't change the ownership and is n't direct ownership unless the company goes through a restructuring where the creditors become the new stock holders in the case of a chapter 11 situation in the us note that this is n't really investing in a small business as much as it is making a loan to the company that will be paid back in cash if the company runs into problems then the creditor could try to pursue the assets of the company to be repaid

i asked a friend and he gave me a good explanation so i 'm just gon na paste it here for others there is a simple and a complex answer depending on how much you want to understand the pricing dynamic of options   leaps do n't react 1:1 with a stock move because the probability of your option being in the money at expiry is still very much up in the air so you basically do n't get full credit for a move in the stock this far out from expiry the more complex answer involves a discussion of option greeks   delta gamma theta vega and are variables that affect the pricing of all options   the key greek in this case is delta because it describes mathematically the expected move of an option as a ratio vs changes in stock price   for put options the ratio is -1 to 0 where -1 is direct correlation between stock price and option price and 0 is no correlation   the delta increases as an option gets deeper in the money and also as it gets closer to expiry and reflects the probability of the option expiring in the money   for your option contract the current delta is   so = 1.9 which is close   also keep in mind that that strike price had a last trade at when the stock was at and the current ask price is so the last price is n't a true reflection of the market value    as for the other greeks gamma is a reflection of volatility in the sense that it affects the rate of change of delta as price and time changes   theta is the value of the time component of the option and is expressed as the expected time decay per day   the problem is that the time premium is really some arbitrary number that the market maker seems to be able to change at will without justification and it can fluctuate wildly over short periods of time and i think this may explain some of the discrepancy    if you bought the options when aapl was $ a couple weeks ago option price of $ and now aapl is at $ and the delta over that time averaged at then your expected option price would be $ $ $ 0.55 + = $ so you lost around $ in time premium or theta burn over the last 2 weeks assuming it opens trading around 22.1 on monday your broker should have information about the option contract greeks somewhere   for my platform i have to put the over top of the option contract for it to show me the greeks   if your broker does n't have this then you can get it from this is another reason that i only invest in deep in the money leaps because the time premium is much much lower than near the money and also because delta is much higher so if i want to trade out of it early i do n't feel like i 'm getting ripped off not getting paid for a stock price move   for example look at the jan 17 175 put   the delta is and the time premium is only $ 0 1 depending if you are looking at the bid or ask   the only downside is expected returns are lower for deep in the money contracts and they are expensive to buy

there actually are legitimate reasons but they do n't apply to most people   here are a few that i know of you 're self employed and have to pay quarterly estimated taxes   rather than wait for the refund when you already have to pay 1/4 of next year 's taxes at the same time you just have the irs apply to refund forward   so you 're not out the money you owe while waiting for your refund you 're filing an amended or late return and so you 're already into the next year and have a similar situation as 1 where your next year 's taxes have already come due you 're planning on declaring bankruptcy and you 're under the tenth circuit those credits might be safe from creditors for almost any other situation you 're better off taking the money and using it to pay down debt or put it somewhere to make interest although at the current rates that might not be very much

sometimes when you are trying to qualify for a loan the lender will ask for proof of your account balances and costs your scheme here could be cause for some questions why are you paying $ 20 30k to your credit card each month is there a large debt you have n't disclosed or perhaps if you lost your job would you be able to afford to continue to pay $ 20 30k of course this is n't a real expense and you can stop whenever you want but still as a lender i would want to understand this fully before loaning to someone who really does need to pay $ 20 30k per month who knows this might hiding some troublesome issues like perhaps a side business is failing and you 're trying to keep it afloat

sounds like you live in a fantasy land where everyone has infinite do over lives and market forces are magic panacea   clean air and water is a public good that should n't be left up to multiple parties upstream or in the region to hash out in a legal system how to remedy problems on a case by case basis while individuals have to deal with resulting cancer brain damage etc   we should n't leave issues like this to crop up from short and cognitive biases of private parties left to their own devices   there should be regulation of industries that minimize the risk impact of pollution without being counterproductive by the economy altogether   if the us had been run the way you want we 'd have had prevalence of gasoline paint and lead in drinking water for decades more   and we 'd have higher crime rates due to the brain damage caused by lead   making all roads private and for profit creates a profit motive in acquiring lands that are strategically important in transportation opening up opportunities for monopolies and collusion   your proposal will replace a government monopoly on roads answerable to voters with a private monopolies or cartels that answer to no one because there is no competition   and this will kill the benefit we have in network effect of public roads   law and law enforcement is a matter of trust   we need to have trust and reasonable expectation of fairness uniformity in the law enforcement and justice system for individuals and companies to conduct their lives business   i am not convinced that a nation with disparate systems with their own private laws and security forces and with no hierarchy somehow achieves that goal

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

generally a one time thing is considered a gift for the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense except for some specific cases for example promotional gifts under $ 25 to vendors can be deducted if you 're a business or charitable contributions to a recognized charity however if this is a regular practice that would not be considered as a gift but rather as a tax fraud a criminal offense being attentive i would like to make a little gift or give some little    < 100 $ amount of money cash wire online for that why generally gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith in the situation you describe this does n't hold when the gift is exempt from income to the receiver the donor pays the tax in this case below exemption the tax is zero if the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes not the donor the situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme if someone does it consistently and regularly as a receiver donor or both he would likely end up in jail

short answer   no longer answer   the only reason to move would be to get out of the condo and into a of equal cost because condos can be quite difficult to sell and you do n't really want that potential burden later on   moving is expensive though and you ca n't afford to spend more when you are already living on the financial edge speaking of living on the edge that 's a recipe for disaster   i make ratio wise a similar sort of income   even accounting for the generous college tuition you should be able to save at least $ 20 k per year at a bare minimum   and if you were careful i figure you should be able to save $ 40k year   you need to figure out where you are dumping all of your money and cut way back on spending and focus entirely on saving money 1   stop eating out   make your own meals   i average about $ 2 per meal per person no junk food   eating out is 6 to 30 times as expensive as making meals at home   do the math   $ 10 2 people number of times you eat out per week 52 $ per year for each time week vs $ 2 2 people 21 3 meals per day 52 $ per year for both of you maximum   now i know some meals are more expensive to prepare but the math is not unrealistic i spend about $ 140 per month on groceries and make the bulk of my own food   eating out is sticker shock for me   the food i prepare is balanced and complete   now i 'm not a complete health nut   i love the occasional deep fried treat or hamburger but those are once every couple of months sort of things which makes them special 2   stop going to starbucks or wherever you go   it takes fuel to get there   it 's also expensive when you get there   bring your own drink if you are hanging out with friends 3   drop golf   or whatever expensive sport you are sinking money into   invest in some cheap running clothes and focus on based   heart health is more important than anything else   if you ca n't live without your sport then find an alternate sport that is equal ish in challenge but a ton cheaper to play   for example if you like playing golf play instead most cities have courses there 's no cost beyond a couple of discs and the challenge is still there 4   drop entertainment   movies at the theater are expensive   drop your cable subscription you are getting financially raped for $   get a netflix subscription and find shows via free online streaming services   buy some dominoes card games and a couple of classic board games   keep entertainment simple and cheap 5   drop your cell phone 's data plan   republic wireless is the only decent cellular provider and even their $ plan is living a luxury lifestyle   if you spend more than $ 10/month person for phone service you are spending too much 6   stop driving everywhere   gas is expensive   cars are expensive   if you have more than two cars sell the extras   if your car is worth more than $ 20,000 sell it and get something cheaper 7   stop drinking alcohol   alcohol impairs mental functions is addictive smells terrible and is ridiculously expensive   there 's no actual need to consume it either by the way do n't go and make major financial changes without the wife 's sign off   finances are the 1 reason for divorce   so get her ok on this stuff   hopefully you already knew that   the above are just some common financial pitfalls where people sink thousands and thousand of dollars and gain nothing   you can still have a full and complete life with just a minimum of the above there is no excuse for living on the edge financially   your story is one i 'm going to share with those who give me the same excuse because they are poor   you are i want to punch you in the face wealthy and you spend every last penny because you think that 's how money works   you are wrong one final piece of advice   find a financial adviser   it is clear to me that you 've been managing money wrong your whole life   a financial adviser will look at your situation and help you far more than someone on the internet ever can   if you attend a church many churches have the excellent crown financial program available which teaches sound financial management principles   the education system does n't show people how to manage money but that 's not an excuse either   once you dig yourself out of the financial hole you 've dug for yourself you can pass the knowledge on how to correctly manage money onto other people

a long straddle using equity would be more akin to buying a triple leveraged etf and an inverse triple leveraged etf only because one side will approach zero while the other can theoretically increase to infinity in a short time span before time decay hits in the reason your analogy fails is because the delta is 1.0 on both sides of your trade at the money options a necessary requirement for a straddle have a delta of .5 there is an options strategy that uses in the money calls and puts with a delta closer to 1.0 to create an in the money strangle i 'm not sure if it is more similar to your strategy an analogous options strategy would be better than yours as it would not share the potential for a margin call

from what i 've heard in the past debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt    secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house   you have a debt but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt then you could by selling that asset    this is what is known as good debt    unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income   an example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that could n't be sold again to pay off the debt    this is know as bad debt you have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always good debt because the house stands good for it though   the problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your good debt is bad debt or no longer secured   cars are very risky this way because they go down in value   it is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down     this is the problem with the term good debt the label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt and the risk associated with having the debt is and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan   perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now people believed the good debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow more than the home was worth to get into a house   thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they could n't afford other advice i 've heard and tend to agree with is that you should only borrow for a house an education and maybe a car danger on that last one being careful to buy a modest house car etc that is well within your means to repay    so if you do have to borrow for a car go for basic transportation instead of the $ 40,000 bmw   keep you house payment less than of your take home pay pay off the school loans as quickly as possible regardless of the label good bad unsecured secured i think that less debt is better than more debt    there is definitely such a thing as too much good debt

basically in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity stable low inflation of 2 4 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable it also discourages hoarding of wealth banks are n't vaults they take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand since most depositors do n't need to withdraw money regularly the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs when times are good banks lend to people and businesses who need capital who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy when times are bad people and businesses either can not get capital or pay more for it which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy people who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like fiat currency and inflation is theft what these people do n't realize is that before the present system where the value of money is based on promises to repay the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation with gold silver based money inflation was driven by discoveries of gold and silver deposits

thanks for the feedback    the cost is $ 20,000 to 50,000 sqft    ya i am just looking for a rough idea of what a similar newer building is costing i figured what we are paying is really high as the building is extremely old and designated as a heritage site so we ca n't just knock it down beautiful building just not very efficient    the newer building is the route i think we are gon na end up going not sure what we can do with the current building as not too many options for resale we ca n't adjust the lease rates to compensate for the cost as the tenants are all seniors and it is an integrated care home a change to apartments would prove difficult as there are no kitchens in 90 of the suites   we are currently paying approximately $ 0.40 a month to heat all electric and the estimate for the new building is $ so it is a pretty huge impact in comparison if it is possible but i have n't heard of a real building actually costing that little before    thanks for the suggestion for the ir i think i am gon na get some one in after the holidays to do a inspection to see if there is any short term fixes we can do with our system

pay off your debt   as you witnessed no investment is guaranteed   but your debt payments are so if you have cash the best way to invest it is to pay off your debt   since your car is depreciating while your house may be appreciating do n't know but it 's possible you should pay off your car loan first   you 're losing money in more than one way on that investment

echoing that bank fees are mostly because they can although partly this is because simply holding onto the money does n't really pay enough for the physical infrastructure of branches atms and staff so like a budget airline they make it up on additional fees but that document does n't actually say they charge 3 for currency conversion it 's 0.20 of transaction amount for currency conversion which is not bad although watch out for the spread between buying and selling rates i see international pos atm transaction fee 3 of transaction amount which is very different that 's a card fee the big issue with these is fraud your card number suddenly being used in a different country will nearly always trigger extra fraud checks it also involves a much more complicated settlement process i 'm more with the monthly service charges and the huge $ 85 fee for international wire transfers

you better consult with a tax adviser ea or cpa on this my answer does n't constitute such an advice basically you 're selling stuff on kickstarter no matter how they call it projects pledges rewards all are just words you 're selling stuff people give you money = pledges and in return you 're giving them tangible or intangible goods = rewards all the rest is just pr so you will pay taxes on all the money you get and you will be able to deduct some of the expenses depends on whether its a business or a hobby the deduction may be full or limited it does n't matter if you use llc or your own account from the financial taxation point of you but it matters legally llc limits your personal liability but do get a legal advice on this issue and whether it is at all relevant for you if you raise funds in 2012 you pay taxes on the money in 2012 if you go into production in 2013 you can deduct expenses in 2013 if you 're classified as a hobby you 'll end up paying full taxes in 2012 and deducting nothing in 2013 talk to a tax adviser

this is not a full answer and i have no personal finance experience but i have a personal story as i did this as stated another point there are various schemes available to help first time    buyers by signing up for this you would exclude yourself from any of    those schemes in the future i did this for my dad when i was 16 or so i am in canada and lost $ 5,000 first time buyers tax rebate as long as many other bonuses like using your for your first home i also am having a fair amount of trouble getting a credit card because even though i am only a part member of the mortgage they expect you to be able to cover the whole thing so when the banks look at my income of say $ 3000 a month they say 3000 you make $ a month i then explain that i do not actually pay the mortage so it is not coming out of my paycheck they do not care i am responsible for full payments and they consider it used

pump and dump strategy is happening everywhere less so in developed market i can tell an experience from emerging market perspective usually several securities brokers work together to pump several penny stocks 5 7 stocks they together and searching for several investors who have money and willing to participate in this scheme these investors will then agree to invest usually with margin from securities to start pumping the stocks the stocks will be pumped until several research analysts take interest in it once the news were spread out regarding these highly speculative stocks the investors gradually dumps the stocks with help of their brokers the things that you need to keep an eye for low trading volume in the previous 3 6 months relative to their peers low p e ratio with earning growth no positive catalyst or material news regarding the company stocks have high momentum observe on weekly rather daily returns pump and dump usually last between 3 months to 6 months

there 's the fear that one might forget the debit is coming and still bounce the payment   personally i agree with dheer 's list i do n't want to give someone unlimited access to my account i make good use of electronic payments where i initiate the payment   for the credit card i use regularly i have a $ 250 monthly payment set to go automatically if i forget to make a payment or lose the bill at least the minimum is covered the monthly charges are enough that when i actually pay the bill in full upon receipt it just goes in toward current charges   bills like gas electric phone are different every month so an auto debit is actually more trouble than how i handle

i think you need to understand the options better before you go around calling anything worthless   $ 11k in a 1 savings account gets you just over $ 100 each year   obviously you 're not buying with your returns but it 's $ 100 more than your checking account will pay you   and you 're guaranteed to get your money back i think a cd ladder is a great way to store your emergency fund   the interest rate on a cd is typically a bit better than a regular savings account though the money is locked away and while we seem to be on the cusp of a rate increase it might not be the best time to put the money in jail   generally there is some sort of fee or lost interest from cashing a cd early   you 're still guaranteed to get your money back stock trading is probably a terrible idea   if you want some market exposure i 'd take half of the money and buy a low expense s&p etf i would n't put my whole savings if i were you or if i were me   many large brokers have an s&p etf option that you can generally buy with no commission and no loads   vanguard is a great option voo schwab has an s&p mutual fund and there are others   actively trading individual stocks is a great way to let commissions and fees erode your account   there are some startup alternatives with lower fees but personally i would stay away from individual stock picking unless you are in school for finance and have some interest in paying attention and you 're ready to possibly never see the money again   you 're not guaranteed to get your money back there are also money market accounts   these will typically pay some interest based on exposing your funds to some risk   it can be a bit better return than a savings account but i probably would n't bother an ira roth and traditional is just an account wrapper that offers certain tax benefits while placing certain restrictions on the use of some or all of the money until you reach retirement age   as a college student you should probably be more concerned about an emergency fund or traveling than retirement savings though some here may disagree with me   with your ira you can buy cds or annuities or stocks and etfs or any other kind of security   depending on what you buy inside the ira you might not be guaranteed to get your money back first you need to figure out what you 'd like to use the money for   then you need to determine when you 'd need the money for that use   then you need to determine if you can sleep at night while your stock account fluctuates a few percent each day   if you ca n't or you do n't have answers for these questions a savings account is a really low friction low risk place store money and combat inflation while you come up with answers for those questions

to explain why you have to be 18 if you are not 18 then any contract that you sign can be voided made invalid by either you or your parents so it would be completely legal for you to go to the bank ask for a $ 1000 loan and for the bank to give you the loan but then you could spend the money and tell the bank sorry i changed my mind i do n't want that loan and sorry again but the money is gone at that point there would be nothing the bank could do to get their money back   obviously banks do n't like this so they wo n't lend you money

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

as you can see from the graphs above as absolute distance from atm at the money increases the ratio represented by delta begins to approach or 1:1 meaning as delta approaches 1 the option price moves up 1 dollar for every 1 dollar the stock price moves up as delta approaches 0 the option price does not move as the stock price moves as the absolute distance from atm increases gamma approaches zero 0 meaning as the price of the option increases or decrease the change in delta is at its highest as the option price is nearest the money as the price of the option moves away from the money in either direction it changes less drastically interestingly delta is the first derivative of the value of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price and gamma is the first derivative of delta definition of delta definition of gamma

an investment is sold when you sell that particular stock or fund it does n't wait until you withdraw cash from the brokerage account whether an investment is subject to long term or short term taxes depends on how long you held that particular stock sorry you ca n't get around the higher short term tax by leaving the money in a brokerage account or re investing in something else if you are invested in a mutual fund whether it 's long or short term depends on when you buy and sell the fund the fact that the fund managers are buying and selling behind your back does n't affect this i do n't know what taxes they have to pay maybe you really are paying for it in the form of management fees or lower returns but you do n't explicitly pay the tax on these inner transactions your broker should send you a tax statement every year giving the numbers that you need to fill in to the various boxes of your income tax form you do n't have to figure it out of course it helps to know the rules if you 've held a stock for 11 1/2 months and are planning to sell you might want to consider waiting a couple of weeks so it becomes a long term capital gain rather than short term and thus subject to lower tax

compounding is just the notion that the current period 's growth or loss becomes the next period 's principal so applied to stocks your beginning value plus growth or loss in value plus any dividends becomes the beginning value for the next period your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them   compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed either by you or to you you have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance the new balance is used to calculate the next period 's interest which again adds to the balance etc obviously it 's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end interest bearing investments like bonds pay simple interest like stock dividends you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect when using a basic calculator tool for stocks you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your interest rate for bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the interest rate factoring in risk you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time believe it or not this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off

your plan is n't bad but it probably is n't worth the cost for the small amount of credit building it will achieve if you do decide to continue with it though you 'll save in interest if you make the big payment now rather than in 6 months in other words you can take the minimum payment multiply it by 5 subtract that amount from the total you owe and pay the difference immediately this way you 'll still get the 6 months of reporting to the credit bureaus but you 'll pay less interest since you 'll have less principle each month i would recommend applying for the credit card right now i believe you 'll probably get approved now if you do then pay off the car loan without thinking about it if you do n't get approved think about it then probably still pay it off regarding the full coverage insurance even after the loan is paid off and you are n't required to have it you may still want to keep it even if you 're the best driver on earth if someone hits you and does n't have insurance or they have insurance and drive off or a deer runs in front of you etc you 'll lose your car and wo n't be reimbursed also as russell pointed out in the comments below without collision coverage your insurance company has no incentive to work on your behalf when someone else hits you so even if it 's not your fault you may still not get reimbursed so i would n't pass on the full coverage unless your car is n't worth very much or you can stomach losing it if something happens good luck and congrats on being able to pay for a car in full at 19 years old

why are they calling it freelance it used to be called self employed   freelance used to mean low wage or no wage gigs and was all about the experience and connections you made which would help propel you into what you wanted    now people are talking about it as though its the way of the future   as an accountant i understand the long term value of labor subcontractors pretty much if you think your job can be done at home it can be out to somebody else who does not have to be a full time employee kinda like the can a robot take my job sorta thing   in summary genuinely good original talent is wasted on freelance because the creator is n't given the tools to make his her best work when that work is finding them and lining up one after the other

if your mortgage interest is tax deductible it 's generally a bad idea to pay down the principal on the mortgage because you 'd be losing the tax deduction you could instead invest it in a tax free municipal bond fund especially if you 're in a high tax bracket including state and local marginal tax rates for example if you have a 5 rate mortgage on your home you could invest in a 3.5 municipal bond and still come out ahead when you apply the tax deduction to your income at a 44 33 federal + 7 state + 4 city in nyc marginal tax rate

this is a technical term referring to the double entry book keeping of trades by brokers suppose a client executes a buy order with their broker   the broker 's accounting for this trade will be recorded as two different deals one deal showing the client as buyer and the broker as seller and a second deal showing the broker as buyer and the clearing house as seller   the net result of these two deals is that the broker has no net position while the client has a net buy and the clearing house has a net sell with respect to this broker 's account as accounted for internally by the broker and the same methods apply for a client sell order the client broker deal record i.e. the client side of the trade is called the client side booking while the broker clearing house deal record is called the street side booking

you owe no tax on the option transaction in 2015 in this case   how you ultimately get taxed depends on how you dispose of the position   if it expires then you will have a short term capital gain on the option position at expiration   if it is exercised then the option is gone for tax purposes and your basis in the underlying is adjusted   from irs publication 550 if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock in your case this will be a long term capital gain for completeness if you buy to cover the option back from the market before expiration or exercise then it is also a short term capital gain also keep in mind that this all assumes that this covered call is qualified so that it does not count as a straddle   you can find more about that in pub 550 all of this is for us tax purposes

the papers you would need to buy are called futures and they give you the right to buy or sell a certain amount of oil at a certain location some large harbor typically for a certain price on a certain day you can typically sell these futures anytime if you find someone that buys them and depending on the direction you bought you will make or lose money according to oil rice changes if you have the future to get oil for 50 $ and the market price is 60 this paper is obviously worth 10 $ note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it which might not be very useful to you as most traders do n't want really any oil that might happen automatically or by default but you need to make sure of that note also that worst case you could lose a lot more money than you put in if you buy a future to deliver oil for 50 $ and the oil price runs you will have to procure the oil for new price meaning pay the current price for it there is no theoretical limit so depending on what you trade you could lose ten times or a thousand times what you invested i worded that without technical lingo so it is clear for beginners this is the concept not the full technical explanation

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

i 'm currently working as an expat and my grandparents used to work overseas but retired to canada so you could say my family has done things completely the opposite of what you suggest however there are a number of very good reasons that my grandparents have done things the way we have and i think it 's worth sharing the rationale there low cost moving to high cost is a no brainer it 's not easy to do but many people are trying nonetheless however even they will be likely to stay in the high cost countries mostly because of health care also safety is a factor but social factors also matter firstly i think two key factors that have been overlooked are language and health most low cost countries speak different languages than high cost countries   this is n't a problem if you 're young but it becomes prohibitive if you are older even if you can manage it 's inconvenient in most countries you ca n't just walk down the street and do whatever you like you either have to keep a handy or restrict your activities to places where you can communicate in your native language your favorite sports channels american football etc might not be available because nobody there cares your favorite news channel or food even in grocery stores might not be so readily available all these reasons made living abroad undesirable for my grandparents but the big deal for them was healthcare   outside of the us every single developed economy has socialized healthcare to a large extent when you 're young it does n't really matter but when you are older it 's a constant concern there are two aspects to firstly if you are a citizen in a developed country there are significant financial benefits in the us there is also medicare medicaid but i do n't know how those work so i 'm not going to talk about that to staying in country when you retire even if the health care would be more it 's the government that 's paying secondly health care in low cost countries tends to either be cheap and poor quality and by poor quality i mean really really scary or expensive and almost as good as a developed country again high quality hospitals in low cost countries may still save you money but the nurses may not speak good english and the doctors may not have a great bed side manner in many low cost countries nobody calls the police because they know the cops do n't care or will never solve the problem i.e. they will arrive hours or days after it 's too late or the cops may even be in on it so basically you try to protect yourself from the inevitable robbery extortion hold up you name it but sooner or later something bad will happen with security guards and being younger it 's less of an issue but when you 're elderly especially if you look foreign and rich it 's definitely more dangerous many of my friends from low income countries try to for this reason and/or in combination with the political climate which is largely corrupt and full of problems so if you 're old why risk it stay somewhere safe

your house does n't need to multiply in order to earn a return your house can provide shelter that is not money but is an economic good and can also save you money if you would otherwise pay rent this is the primary form of return on the investment for many houses it is similar for other large capital investments like industrial robots washing machines or automobiles the value of money depends on as long as the size and velocity of the money supply changes about as much as the overall economic activity changes everything is pretty much good a little more and you will see the money lose value inflation a little less and the money will gain value deflation   as long as the value of inflation or deflation remains very low the specifics matter relatively little prices including wages the price of work do a good job of adjusting when there is inflation or deflation the main problem is that people tend to use money as a unit of account e.g. you owe $ 100,000 on your mortgage i have $ 500 in the bank changing the value of those numbers makes it really hard to plan for the future imagine if prices and wages fell in half it would be twice as hard to pay off your mortgage or if the bank expected massive inflation in the future they would want to charge you a lot more interest presently inflation is the norm because the government entities who help adjust how much money there will be through monetary policy interest rates and the like ask about it if you 're interested will generally gradually increase the supply of money a little bit more quickly than the economy in general they may also be worried that outright deflation over the long term will lead to people purchases to get more for their money later harming overall economic activity so they tend to err on the slightly positive side the value of money however has not really ordinarily decreased until the modern era the 1930s or so during much of history a relatively low fixed amount of valuable commodities gold served as money when the economy grew and the same amount of money represented more economic activity the money became more valuable and deflation this could have the unfortunate effect of investment because rich jerks with lots of money could see their riches increase just by holding on to those riches instead of doing anything productive with them and changes in the supply of gold havoc with the money supply whenever there was some event like a gold rush because precious metals were at the base of the monetary    system rushes increased the money supply which resulted in inflation    soaring gold output from the california and australia gold rushes is    linked with a thirty percent increase in wholesale prices between 1850    and likewise right at the end of the century a surge    in gold production reversed a decades long deflationary trend and is    often credited with indebted farmers and helping to end the    populist party ’s strength and its call for a gold and    silver money standard the california gold rush today there is way too little gold production to represent all the growth in world economic activity but we do n't have a gold standard anymore so gold is valuable on its own merits because people want to buy it using money and its price is free to fluctuate when it gets more valuable and people pay more for it mines will go through more effort to locate extract and refine it because it will be more profitable that 's how most commodities work for more information on these of history some in depth articles on

your plan as proposed will not work because it goes against how banks make money banks make money in two ways   1 fees including account fees investment advice fees mortgage application fees etc and 2 interest rate spread they borrow money for x% and they lend it out for in a simple form someone gives the bank a deposit and earns 1 the bank turns around to the next person in line and loans the money to them for 4 you are asking them to turn the interest rate spread into a cost instead of their main source of profit you are asking the bank to borrow money from another person paying them 1.2 interest and then loan the money to you paying you 0.6 interest and keeping 0.6 for themselves the bank would lose money doing this technically yes you can borrow from a bank and invest it in something earning above the 4 interest they will charge you you can then pay the bank 's interest off of your earnings and make some profit for yourself but this carries an inherent risk if your investment loses money you still owe the bank effectively increasing the negative impact of your investment this tactic is called leveraging you can look it up on this site or on google it is not something you should do if you do not fully understand the risks you are taking on given that you are asking this question i would suggest that you are not yet well informed enough to make this sort of investment you run serious risk of losing everything if you over leverage assuming the banks will even lend you money in the first place

after filing a chapter 7 the more common form in the usa you have to wait 8 years to file another chapter 7 but only 4 years to file a chapter 13 repayment rather than liquidation at least in theory in practice it does not always look that neat and tidy    chapter 13 you can file a new 13 two years later but there are not many reasons you would      this is the new law   under the old law you could pretty much file chapter 13 as often as you like   in fact my last firm did have one client who managed to fall behind on their house before them chapter 7 was even completed and ended up needing to file a chapter 13 while their chapter 7 was still pending

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

i thought the other answers had some good aspect but also some things that might not be completely correct so i 'll take a shot as noted by others there are three different types of entities in your question   the etf spy the index spx and options contracts first let 's deal with the options contracts   you can buy options on the etf spy or marked to the index spx   either way options are about the price of the etf index at some future date so the local min and max of the underlying symbol generally will not coincide with the min and max of the options   of course the closer the expiration date on the option the more closely the option price tracks its underlying directly   beyond the difference in how they are priced the options market has different liquidity and so it may not be able to track quick moves in the underlying although there 's a reasonably robust market for option on spy and spx specifically second let 's ask what forces really make spy and spx move together as much as they do   it 's one thing to say spy is tied to spx but how   there are several answers to this but i 'll argue that the most important factor is that there 's a notion of authorized participants who are players in the market who can create shares of spy at will   they do this by accumulating stock in the constituent companies and turning them into the market maker   there 's also the corresponding notion of redemption by which an authorized participant will turn in a share of spy to get stock in the constituent companies see and meanwhile spx is just computed from the prices of the constituent companies so it 's got no market forces directly on it   it just reflects what the prices of the companies in the index are doing of course those companies are subject to market forces key point creation redemption is the real driver for keeping the price aligned   if it gets too far out of line then it creates an arbitrage opportunity for an authorized participant   if the price of spy gets too high compared to spx and therefore the constituent stocks an authorized participant can simultaneously sell short spy shares and buy the constituent companies stocks   they can then use the redemption process to close their position at no risk   and vice versa if spy gets too low now that we understand why they move together why do n't they move together perfectly   to some extent information about fees slight differences in composition between spy and spx over time etc do play   the bigger reasons are probably that a there are not a lot of authorized participants b there are a relatively large number of companies represented in spy so there 's some actual cost and risk involved in trying to quickly buy sell the full set to capture the theoretical arbitrage that i described and c redemption creation units only come in pretty big blocks which complicates the issues under point b. you asked about dividends so let me comment briefly on that too   the dividend on spy is more or less passing on the dividends from the constituent companies i think not completely sure that the market maker deducts its fees from this cash so it 's not a direct pass through   but each company pays on its own schedule and spy does not make a payment every time so it 's holding a corresponding amount of cash between its dividend payments   this is factored into the price through the creation redemption process   i do n't know how big of a factor it is though

because my accountant said i 'm in the 28 bracket and need more write offs when i hear someone say this i tell them to get a new accountant advisor tax guy   the benefit if any is the fact that if and only if a hat tip to you are already itemizing your deductions   it means that for me my 3.5 mortgage is really costing me   the only effect of this is the when i line up my debts the mortgage might fall to a lower priority for payback this is where there 's a balance between the choice of a robust emergency fund earning close to 0 today or using those funds to pay the mortgage at an accelerated rate   if the sentiment expressed by the question implies that one should carry a mortgage needed or not it really comes down the a question of risk over the long term i do n't suggest that people take a mortgage today to invest in the market a zero return as we just saw in the will show you that the 10 market return is an average over the very long term fwiw the period returned and 2 years short of the 10 few have the discipline to patiently wait out the dips and see the returns i quoted   that said the fact that the interest is deductible is a small factor given the low rates we are currently enjoying   each of the points above can be expanded into its own answer a great question with not so simple answers

is investing a good idea with a low amount of money yes i 'll take the angle that you can invest in penny stocks there 's nothing wrong with that the oversimplified suggestion i would make is to answer the question about your risk aversion this is the four e.g.   you are introduced to when you first sit down to open your brokerage stocks or employer retirement account 401 k along with a release of liability in the language of past performance is not an indicator which you will not truly understand until you experience a market crash the reason i say this is because if you are 100 risk averse then it is clear which vehicles you want to have in your tool belt t bills cds money market and plain vanilla savings absolutely nothing wrong with this do n't let anyone make you feel otherwise with remarks like your money is not working for you sitting there it 's extremely important to be absolutely honest with yourself in doing this assessment too for example i thought i was a risk taker except when the market tumbled i reacted exactly how a knee jerk investor would also i feel it 's not easy to know just how honest you are with yourself as we are humans and not impartial machines so the recommendation i would give is to make a strong correlation to casino gambling in other words conventional advice is to only take play money to the casino this because you assume you will lose it then you can enjoy yourself at the casino knowing this is capital that you are okay throwing in the trash   i would strongly caution you to only ever invest capital in the stock market that you characterize as play money i 'm convinced financial advisors fund managers friends will disagree still i feel this is the only way you will be completely okay when the market fluctuates you wo n't lose sleep if you choose this approach then you can start investing any time that five drachma you were going to throw away on lottery tickets transfer it into your roth ira that twenty yen that you were going to ante in your weekly poker night transfer it into your index fund you already got past the investors remorse of losing that money if you truly accept that amount as play money then you can put it into penny stocks i 'll get lots of criticism here however i maintain that once you are truly okay with throwing that cash away like you would drop it into a slot machine then it 's the same whether you lose it one way or in another investment vehicle

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away
