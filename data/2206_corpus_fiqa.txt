so you think there is a business that can take $ x and in two weeks turn it into $ 10x plus their profit   that means that in two weeks you can turn $ 1,000 into $ 10,000 so every two weeks you add a zero in six weeks you add 3 zeros in 12 weeks total your $ 1,000 is now $ and in a few weeks after that you are richer than bill gates all guaranteed run away

there are legitimate multi currency mutual funds but i do n't think their rate of return will produce the extra money you 're looking for any faster than any other kind of investment with comparable risks to make money fast you have to accept risk of losing money fast which is n't what you seem to have in mind

like i said the heat index is just a how it feels calculation i never said the heat index determines evaporation just that the calculation for getting the heat index is based on humidity and temperature   the dew point based on temperature and humidity is what governs evaporation   the dew point is the temperature at which water will evaporate given a specific relative humidity   in other words you ca n't calculate the dew point unless you know the humidity   if your skin temp is lower than the dew point water will condense on your skin   it does n't matter if other things are cooler than your skin water may condense on those items more quickly but it will still condense on you

there seems to be a common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns what evidence exists for or against this first off even if the markets were entirely random there would be individual investors that would consistently beat the market throughout their lifetime entirely by luck   there are just so many people this is a statistical certainty   so let 's talk about evidence of beating the market due to persistent skill i should hedge by saying there is n't a lot of good data here as most understandably most individual investors do n't give out their investment information but there are some ok datasets   there is weak evidence for instance that the best individual investors keep outperforming and interestingly that the trading of individual investors can predict future market movements   though the evidence is more clear that individual investors make a lot of mistakes and that these winning portfolios are not from commonly available strategies and involve portfolios that are much riskier than most   would recommend is there really no investment strategy that would make it likely for this investor to consistently outperform her benchmark there are so many papers many reasonable even out there about how to outperform benchmarks especially risk adjusted basis   not too mention some advisers with great track records and a sea of questionable websites   you can even copy most of what buffet does if you want remember though that the average investor by definition makes the average market return and then pays fees on top of that   if there is a strategy out there that is obviously better than the market and a bunch of people start doing it it quickly becomes expensive to do and becomes part the market   if there was a proven easy to implement way to beat the market everyone would do it and it would be the market so why is it that on this site or elsewhere whenever an active trading strategy is discussed that potentially beats the market there is always a claim that it probably wo n't work to start with there are a large number of clearly bad ideas posed here and elsewhere   sometimes though the ideas might be good and may even have a good chance to beat the market   like so many of the portfolios that beat the market though and they add a lot of uncertainty and in particular for this personal finance site risk that the person will not be able to live comfortably in retirement there is so much uncertainty in the market and that is why there will always be people that consistently outperform the market but at the same time why there will be few if any strategies that will outperform consistently with any certainty

most 401k plans maybe even all 401k plans as a matter of law allow the option of moving the money in your 401k account from one mutual fund to another   within the group of funds that are in the plan   so you can exit from one fund and put all your 401k money not just the new contributions into another fund in the group if you like   whether you can find a fund within that group that invests only in the companies that you approve of is another matter as mhoran_psprep 's answer points out changing investments inside a 401k ditto iras 403b and 457 plans is without tax consequence which is not the case when you sell one mutual fund and buy another in a non retirement account

i saw that an answer has n't been accepted for this yet being bearish is a good hedging strategy but being hedged is a better hedging strategy the point being that not everything in investments is so binary up and down a lot of effective hedges can have many more variables than simply stock go up stock go down as such there are many ways to be bearish and profit from a decline in market values without subjecting yourself to the unlimited risk of short selling buying puts against your long equity position is one example being long an etf that is based on short positions is another example

he offered a 15 stake   he showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20   this left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark was n't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot he was n't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5   you give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it   every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return so after increasing by 5 to 20 he would not have added another 35 based on their arguments he would reason why an additional 2.5 would be the most he could offer without additional consideration if he jumped from 15 to say 40 too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that   so he went from 15 to 20 in response to the 75 equity stake and did nothing to seem or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next and last negotiator   the last guy was n't willing to walk away and showed that he was n't going to be pushed into a bad deal so a deal got done   dunno if that makes sense but his assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless won the day

yes your business needs to be in the business of making money in order for you to deduct the expenses associated with it i suppose in theory this could mean that if you take in $ 10,000 and spend $ 30,000 every year you not only do n't get a net deduction of $ 20,000 your loss but you have to pay tax on $ 10,000 your revenue however this is super just only deduct $ of your expenses small profit for all the gory details including how they consider whether you have an expectation of profits see this expectation of profit rule appears to apply to things like i sell home items or home decorating advice and therefore need to take several multi week trips to exotic vacation destinations every year and deduct them as business expenses if you 're doing or in your home and selling on etsy you do n't particularly have any expenses it 's hard to imagine a scenario where you consistently sell for less than the cost of materials and then end up dinged on paying tax on revenue

the first step i would do is determine the asset class mixture for your current portfolio and the mixture for your new one if they are the same and all you are doing is changing the funds that you use to invest in that mixture of asset class then just do the change all at once in this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes   if you are also changing your asset class mixture then it depends on how large the change is i would still do the whole change at once but if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps i would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix

yes there are huge number of parts in the chain entire careers can be made out of handling clearing and settlement back office work for banks exchanges and trading houses even more so in the old days when this had to be done by hand but obviously now everything is electronic i can provide some insight into your questions at least on the trading side   brokers in many cases have their own brokers or their own trading operations they will have their own order entry and risk control systems so that is all proprietary but it usually does n't involve more than send buy sell y shares of name x to venue z at price p with extra instructions a b c d e. eventually an order will make its way to a direct market participant who sends an electronic order directly to an exchange   note that when you say market you should be referring to such exchanges in the us these are the nyse nasdaq and so on when you are talking about futures there is the cme and so on in europe there is the and so on the market refers to all these exchanges together which all have their own order mechanisms and matching engines in many cases exchanges will route orders to other exchanges depending on the specific country 's trading rules exchanges compete with each other by fee and liquidity offerings which are directly by market participants   another detail is that each market participant has its own clearing firm which has prior credit lines established with the market participant and a central clearing house like you said as soon as an order is matched the exchange where the order takes place hands the trade over to the clearing house where the trade is then settled between the clearing firms representing either side of the trade clearing disputes happen at this step

generally interest only mortgages are a bad idea because a lot of people get them so that they can buy more house than they could otherwise afford lower payment = affordable in their minds   if the house continues to go up in value they probably get away with it because when the balance becomes due they can refinance   however the last few years has shown how risky that strategy can be and this kind of things is what cost a lot of people their houses in your case if the house is something you could afford on a regular 15 or 30-year mortgage and you really are as disciplined as you say you are you might get away with it   but you have to take into account the risk and consider what happens if there is a job loss or similar difficulty in the future another thing to consider is the term of the mortgage   how many years will you get this lower interest rate   interest rates are at historic lows right now and pretty much everyone thinks they 're going up soon   you might be better off locking in a higher rate for 15 years

savings accounts have lower fees if you do n't anticipate doing many transactions per month e.g. three or fewer withdrawals then i would suggest a savings account rather than a checking account a joint account that requires both account holder signatures to make withdrawals will probably require both account holders signature endorsements in order to make deposits for example if you are issued a tax refund by the u.s. treasury or any check that is payable to both parties you will only be able to deposit that check in a joint account that has both persons as there can be complications due to multi party account ownership if cashing versus depositing a joint check and account tax id number when you open the account you will need to specify what your wishes are regarding whether both parties or either party can make deposits and withdrawals also at least one party will need to be present with appropriate identification probably tax id or social security number when opening the account   if the account has three or more owners you might be required to open a business or commercial account rather than a consumer account this would be due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two after the questioner specified interest north carolina in the comments i found that the north carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts any two or more persons may establish a deposit account    the deposit account and any balance shall be as joint tenants    unless the persons establishing the account have agreed with the bank    that withdrawals require more than one signature payment by the bank    to or on the order of either person on the account the bank 's obligation i looked for different banks in north carolina i found joint account terms similar to this in pdf file format everywhere joint account if an item is drawn so that it is unclear whether one payee ’s    endorsement or two is required only one endorsement will be     required and the bank shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the    maker as a result of there being only one endorsement also   joint accounts are owned by you individually or jointly with others    all of the funds in a joint account may be used to repay the debts of    any co owner whether they are owed individually by a co owner    jointly with other co owners or jointly with other persons or    entities having no interest in your account you will need to tell the bank specifically what permissions you want for your joint account as it is between you and your bank in north carolina

from the irs page on estimated taxes emphasis added taxes must be paid as you earn or receive income during the year either through withholding or estimated tax payments if the amount of income tax withheld from your salary or pension is not enough or if you receive income such as interest dividends alimony self employment income capital gains prizes and awards you may have to make estimated tax payments if you are in business for yourself you generally need to make estimated tax payments estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax but other taxes such as self employment tax and alternative minimum tax i think that is crystal clear that you 're paying income tax as well as self employment tax to expand a bit you seem to be confusing self employment tax and estimated tax which are not only two different things but two different kinds of things   one is a tax and the other is just a means of paying your taxes self employment tax refers to the social security and medicare taxes that you must pay on your self employment income   this is an actual tax that you owe   if you receive a w-2 half of it is paid by your employer and half of it is paid by you in the form of visible deductions on your pay stub   if you 're self employed you have to pay all of it explicitly estimated tax does not refer to any actual tax levied on anyone   a more correct phrasing would be estimated tax payment   estimated taxes are just payments that you make to the irs to pay tax you expect to owe   whether you have to make such payments depends on how much tax you owe and whether you 've paid it by other means   you may need to pay estimated tax even if you 're not self employed although this would be unusual   it could happen for instance if you realized large capital gains over the year   you also may be self employed but not need to pay estimated tax if for instance you also have a w-2 job and you reduce your withholding allowances to have extra tax withheld that said if you earn significant income from self employment you 'll likely have to make estimated tax payments   these are prepayments of the income tax and social security medicare taxes you accrue based on your self employment income as pete b. mentioned in his answer a possible reason that your are low is because some taxes have already been withheld from the paychecks you received so far during the year while you were an employee   these represent tax payments you 've already made you do n't need to pay that money a second time but you may need to make estimated tax payments for your income going forward

while the question is very localized i 'll answer about the general principle my main question is with how far away it is over 1000 miles how do    i quantify the travel expenses generally necessary and ordinary expenses are deductible this is true for business and also true for rentals but what is necessary and what is ordinary is it ordinary that a landlord will manage the property 1000 miles away by himself on a daily basis is it ordinary for people to drive 1000 miles every week i 'd say no to both i 'd say it would be cheaper for you to hire a local property manager thus the travel expense would not be necessary i would say it would be cheaper to fly although i do n't know if its true to the specific situation of the op but as i said its too localized to deal with rather than drive from texas to colorado if the op thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary he 'll have to justify it to the irs examiner as i 'm sure it will be examined 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100 write off 2000    miles hotels etc from what i understood and that is what i 've been told by my cpa irs generally allows 1 one trip per year per property if there 's an exceptional situation be prepared to justify it also keep all the receipts like gas hotel etc if you claim mileage but in reality you took a flight you 'll get hit hard by the irs when audited also while i 'm up there am i allowed to mix business with pleasure you can not deduct personal pleasure expenses at all if the trip is mainly business but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel that 's fine but if the trip is business trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days the whole trip may be disallowed if there 's a reasonable portion dedicated to your business rental and the rest is pleasure you 'll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities you 'll have to analyze your specific situation and see where it falls do n't stretch the limits too much it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties can i also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the    property although again the necessary and ordinary justification of such a trip is arguable lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified it is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing imho of course i 'm not an authority such an expense can be either business or investment expense if its a business expense its deductible on schedule c. if its an investment expense if you do buy the property its added to the cost of the property capitalized i 'm not a tax adviser or a tax professional and this is not a tax advice this answer was not written or intended to be used and can not be used for the purpose of avoiding any tax related penalties that may be imposed on you or any other person under the internal revenue code you should seek a professional consultation with a cpa licensed in your or a federally licensed enrolled agent ea

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

in an ipo initial public offering or additional public offering situation a small group of stakeholders as few as one basically decide to offer an additional number of shares of equity in the company usually these shares are all equal if you own one share you own a percentage of the company equal to that of anyone else who owns one share the sum total of all shares theoretically equals the entire value of the company and so with n shares in existence one share is equivalent to the company and entitles you to of the profits of the company and more importantly to some gives you a vote in company matters which carries a weight of of the entire shareholder body now not all of these shares are public most companies have the majority of shares owned by a small number of controlling interests these entities usually founding owners or their families may be prohibited by agreement from selling their shares on the open market other controlling interests have right of first refusal for private companies all the shares are divided this way for public companies the remainder is available on the open market and those shares can be bought and sold without involvement by the company buyers ca n't buy more shares than are available on the entire market now when a company wants to make more money a high share price at the time of the issue is always good for two reasons first the company only makes money on the initial sale of a share of stock once it 's in a third party 's hands any profit from further sale of the stock goes to the seller not the company so it does little good to the company for its share price to soar a month after its issue the company 's already made its money from selling the stock if the company knew that its shares would be in higher demand in a month it should have waited because it could have raised the same amount of money by selling fewer shares second the price of a stock is based on its demand in the market and a key component of that is scarcity the fewer shares of a company that are available the more they 'll cost when a company issues more stock there 's more shares available so people can get all they want and the demand drops taking the share price with it when there 's more shares each share being a smaller percentage of the company earns less in dividends as well which figures into several key metrics for determining whether to buy or sell stock like earnings per share and price earnings ratio now you also asked about dilution that 's pretty straightforward by adding more shares of stock to the overall pool you increase that denominator each share becomes a smaller percentage of the company the privately held stocks are reduced in the same way the problem with simply adding stocks to the open market getting their initial purchase price is that a larger overall percentage of the company is now on the open market meaning the controlling interests have less control of their company if at any time the majority of shares are not owned by the controlling interests then even if they all agree to vote a certain way for instance whether or not to merge assets with another company another entity could buy all the public shares or convince all existing public shareholders of their point of view and overrule them there are various ways to avoid this the most common is to issue multiple types of stock typically common stock carries equal voting rights and equal shares of profits preferred stock typically trades a higher share of earnings for no voting rights a company may therefore keep all the common stock in private hands and offer only preferred stock on the market there are other ways to class stocks most of which have a similar tradeoff between earnings percentage and voting percentage typically by balancing these two you normalize the price of stocks if one stock had better dividends and more voting weight than another the other stock would be near worthless but companies may create and issue to controlling interests to guarantee both profits and control you 'll never see a on the open market where they exist they are very closely held but if a company issues the market will see that and the price of their publicly available common stock will depreciate sharply another common way to increase market cap without diluting shares is simply to create more shares than you issue publicly the remainder goes to the current controlling interests when facebook solicited outside investment before it went public that 's basically what happened the original founders were issued additional shares to maintain controlling interests though not as significant balancing the issue of new shares to the investors the ideal form of this is a stock split the company simply the number of shares it has outstanding by x and issues additional shares to each current holder of one share this effectively divides the price of one share by x lowering the barrier to purchase a share and thus hopefully driving up demand for the shares overall by making it easier for the average joe investor to get their foot in the door however issuing shares to controlling interests increases the total number of shares available decreasing the market value of public shares that much more and reducing the amount of money the company can make from the stock offering

personally i think you are approaching this from the wrong angle   you 're somewhat correct in assuming that what you 're reading is usually some kind of marketing material   systematic investment plan sip is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world   dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the us on average verified by many studies individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners   say you decide to invest in a mutual fund dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying when you feel the market is low as an example i 'll compare investing $ 50 per week on versus 1 share per week on or the full $ 850 on the first wednesday    i 'll use the vanguard large cap fund as an example   i realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different i just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle   by investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs   it also keeps your investment easy to budget vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments which is illustrated in the third column above and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing ultimately all of these companies are to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique   if they all called dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging none of them would appear to be unique   so they devise neat acronyms but it 's all pretty much the same idea   trickle your money in to your investments as the money becomes available to you

you are right about the stock and index funds with dollar cost averaging over several years the daily price of the security especially a dividend paying security will not matter because your position will have accumulated larger over several entry points some entries with cheaper shares and some entries with more expensive shares in the future your position will be so large that any uptick will net you large gains on your original equity not matter being a reference to even extreme forms of volatility but if you had all your equity in a poor company and tanked never to rise again then you would still be in a losing position even with dollar cost averaging if your only other holdings are bonds then you may want to sell those to free up capital

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

the simplest explanation is that a traditional ira is a method of deferring taxes that is normally you pay taxes on money you earn at the ordinary rate then invest the rest and only pay the capital gains rate   however with a traditional ira you do n't pay taxes on the money when you earn it you defer the payment of those taxes until you retire so in the end it ends up being treated the same that said if you are strategic about it you can wind up paying less taxes with this type of account

it depends to some extent on how you interpret the situation so i think this is the general idea say you purchase one share at $ 50 and soon after the price moves up say to $ 55 you now have an unrealized profit of $ 5 now you can either sell and realize that profit or hold on to the position expecting a further price appreciation in either case you will consider the price change from this traded price which is $ 55 and not the price you actually bought at hence if the price fell to $ 52 in the next trade you have a loss of $ 3 on your previous profit of $ 5 this even though your net p&l is calculated from the initial purchase price of $ 50 allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices this is similar to a markov process in the sense that it does n't matter which route the stock price and your position 's p&l took to get to the current point your decision should be based on the current latest price level

somebody will have to file all the required paperwork and fees with the local government state government and even the federal government this paperwork is used by these governments to record who owns the property and how it is owned   prior to the settlement date they also will need to verify how the property is described and owned so that you are sure that you are being sold the exact property you expect and that it is delivered to you free and clear of all other debts if this is done wrong you might discover years later that you paid money for something that you do n't really own in some jurisdictions this has to be done via a law office in others there is no requirement for a lawyer because a mortgage company bank or credit union is giving you money for the loan they may require you to use a settlement attorney they do n't want to discover in 5 years that a simple mistake will cost them hundreds of thousands to fix the mortgage company is required to give you a more detailed estimate of all the closing costs before you are committed to the loan the quoted paragraph is not good enough even if you can avoid the use of a lawyer these functions still need to be done by somebody and that will still cost money

i 'm the odd man out    my previous boss at the same company had a kid at 15 despite the extra responsibility she managed to become a cpa and have a relatively successful accounting career   yeah it 's nuts what are the odds that all these people had kids early right get this the purchasing manager 's daughter had a baby at 19 she managed to hook her daughter up with a job at my place of employment in order to help her earn enough money to care for the baby father out there definitely seems to be a company culture of this sort of thing   as far as seizing a promotion i do n't understand why someone who is inferior in every aspect except personal favor is automatically the best candidate for a promotion due to backdoor politics so what you 're saying is that i should focus on my soft skills and less on everything else in order to get ahead it seems wrong that i 'm forced to be stuck where i am because of back door politics and not because of merit and my ability to add value to the company i guess i do n't fit into the company culture because i do n't have a sob story about how i 'm supporting children i conceived before i was legally able to vote    edit i should probably find another company that appreciates high performers

fyi i 'm not a lawyer i would not try to reverse the transfer   you need to create a paper trail as to what happened to this money and why   be sure to document whatever you do reach out again reach out to the company again and see if you can transfer the money back to their account   a wire transfer is $ 20 usually be sure to negotiate the company covering this and every other fee if you can not reach them you could probably move the money to an escrow account at your new bank   the new bank will likely be able to advise you on the best way do this   you should probably also send a letter via certified mail to ensure they received it informing them you 've done this and how to get in touch with you by putting the money in an escrow account you 've proven that you have n't used it and if the company wants it back its very obvious who 's money it is   sending the certified mail someone must sign for it will also create a paper trail that will help you if things get ugly finally do n't spend it

while the issuer of the security such as a stock or bond not the short is responsible for the credit risk the issuer and the short of a derivative is one in all cases it is more than likely that a trader is owed securities by an agent such as a broker or exchange or clearinghouse legally only the options clearing corporation clears openly traded options   with stocks and bonds brokerages can clear with each other if approved while a trader is expected to fund margin the legal responsibility is shared by all in the agent chain   clearinghouses are liable to exchanges   exchanges are liable to members   traders are liable to brokerages   both ways and so on clearinghouses are usually ultimately liable for counterparty risk to the long counterparty and the short counterparty is ultimately liable to the clearinghouse clearinghouses are not responsible for the credit risk of stocks and bonds because the issuers are not short those securities on the exchange thus no margin is required   credit risk for stocks and bonds is mitigated away from the clearing process

the answer is mathematics let 's say you have $ 100 capital to invest with with a mortgage with a unit trust assuming you do n't put in borrowed money 5 growth on the property is $ 25 but a $ 25 profit on a unit trust requires 25 growth well that 's assuming zero interest and zero fees let 's say interest is 3 but so are trust fees a property now requires 8 growth for $ 25 profit in a year where a unit trust now requires 29 growth for $ 25 profit which one is more likely the above calculations do n't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables debt is n't a bad thing so do n't be afraid of using debt with debt you can borrow more to invest having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where if the math makes sense

the lot size is 100 troy ounce see the contract specification at the same site so with the current price of around $ one lot would cost you around there may be other sites that offer smaller lots you would need to check with your broker if the price moves up by $ 500 you gain $ 50,000 for a lot the margin required changes from time to time   currently it 's $ with a maintenance of $ so a drop of $ per oz of gold will cause a margin call you make or lose 100 times the per oz movement as there are 100 oz in the contract you cited there 's also a broker fee analogous to the commission on a stock trade   the other option would be to buy a fund that invests in gold this will be more easier to buy and the lot sizes will be much less i hope you jumped into this great opportunity at the time experts said gold would have a straight run to $ 5000

first off i highly recommend the book get a financial life   the basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward and this book does a great job with it   it is very light reading and it really geared for the young person starting their career   it is n't the most current book pre real estate boom but the recommendations in the book are still sound   update new edition of the book came out now with that out of the way there 's really two kinds of investing to think about for most individuals it is best to take care of 1 first   most people should n't even think about 2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts established an emergency fund and gotten their debt under control there are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing both from your employer and the government   all the more reason to take care of 1 before 2 your employer probably offers some kind of 401k or equivalent like a 403b with a company provided match   this is a potential 100 return on your investment after the vesting period   no investment you make on your own will ever match that   additionally there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k   the money you contribute does n't count as taxable income the best way to start investing is to learn about your employer 's retirement plan and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching beyond this there are also individual retirement accounts iras you can open to contribute money to on your own   you should open one of these and start contributing but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k   the ira wo n't give you that 100 roi that the 401k will keep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much walled off from your day to day financial life   money that goes into a retirement account generally ca n't be touched until retirement age unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties   you generally do n't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account one other thing to note   your 401 k and your ira is an account that you put money into   just because the money is sitting in the account does n't necessarily mean it is invested   you put the money into this account and then you use this money for investments   how you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself   here is a good starting point   if you want to ask questions about retirement portfolios it is probably worth posting a new question

1 for fha loans pmi is required for where there is not at least 20 equity   bank financed non fha loans may have other standards if you are getting an fha loan if possible put down 20   so that you do not have to pay pmi   that said your pmi costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the pmi covers the difference between your equity value based on the appraisal at time of purchase and 20 equity value of the home so if you buy a home for 100 appraisal price 20 equity would be 85k   so if you put 10 down you would be paying pmi until you accrue an addition in equity   and you will be paying pmi on that for about 12 on 30 year mortgage or until you home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20 equity   there are ways to get out of pmi early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you pay more closing costs 2 different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points   we paid $ 300 for a 1.5 reduction in our interest rate less than 1 but it was called a point we were offered a few other points .25 for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for but declined but they may make more sense on a home than our more modest one   you can talk to a banker about this now get helps with getting offers accepted sometimes and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you   this meeting should be would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong and help answer your questions more than anyone here can    3 the costs will come out of your down payment   so if you put down down your costs will come out of that   so you will probably end up with being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs   you can tell the banker you want to put 10 towards the price and the banker will give you a down payment probably around 50k to cover costs etc   my figures are hopefully intentionally high better to find out that it will cost less than my than get your hopes up just to find out the costs are higher than expected

well the real problem here is that when the government or really any entity controls education especially on a widespread but centralized basis it means that everyone is trained to think alike   and as the saying goes when everyone is thinking the same thing no one is really thinking at all   education is inherently a system of doctrine = teaching that 's really not a radical statement nor is it some conspiracy theory it 's really just saying the same thing in two different forms though obviously one seems more than the other   for example when people talk about the need for kids to be properly socialized via attending public schools what they are really saying whether they realize it or not is that they believe all children should be into accepting amp regurgitating the currently dominant socio political dogma   far from creating critical thinkers or from promoting diversity it really achieves the opposite facilitating a mindless conformity which ironically might even include a conformity though it remains a conformity nonetheless what is lost is truly innovative independent minds and the proof of this will be demonstrated by the herd hivemind that will downvote this post

in general yes if interest rates go higher then any existing fixed rate bonds and hence etfs holding those bonds become less valuable the further each bond is from maturity the larger the impact as you suggest once the bonds do mature the fund can replace them at a market price so the effect tails off the bond market has a concept known as duration that helps reason about this effect roughly it measures the average time from now to each payout of the bond weighted by the payout the longer the duration the more the price will change for a given change in interest rates the concept is just an approximation and there are various slightly different ways of calculating it but very roughly the price of a bond will reduce by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates so a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5 of its value for a 1 rise in interest rates and of course vice versa for your second question it really depends on what you 're trying to achieve by diversifying this might be best as a different question that gives more detail as it 's not very related to your first question short term bonds are less risky but both will lose value if the underlying company is in trouble gilts government bonds are less risky than corporate bonds

first let me fill in the gaps on your situation based on the numbers you 've given so far i estimate that your student loan balance principal is $ with the variable rate loan option that you 've presented the maximum interest rate you could be charged would be 11.5 which would bring your monthly payment up to that $ number you gave in the comments your thoughts are correct about the advantage to paying this loan off sooner   if you are planning on paying off this loan sooner the interest rate on the variable rate loan has less opportunity to climb one thing to be cautious of with the comparison though the $ 1200 difference between the two options is only valid if your rate does not increase   if the rate does increase of course the difference would be less or it could even go the other way   so keep in mind that the $ 1200 savings is only a theoretical maximum you wo n't actually see that much savings with the variable rate option before making a decision you need to find out more about the terms of this variable rate loan how often can your rate go up what is the loan rate based on i 'm not as familiar with student loan variable rate loans but there are other variable rate loans i am familiar with with a typical adjustable rate home mortgage the rate is locked for a certain number of years perhaps 5 years   after that the bank might be allowed to raise the rate once every period of months perhaps once every year   there will be a limit to how much the rate can rise on each increase perhaps 1.0 and there will be a maximum rate that could be charged over the life of the loan perhaps 12 the interest rate on your mortgage can adjust up inside of those parameters   the actual formula used to adjust will be found in the fine print of your mortgage contract   however the bank knows that if they let your rate get too high above the current market rates you will refinance to a different bank   so the mortgage is typically structured so that it will raise your rate somewhat but it wo n't usually get too far above the market rate   if you knew ahead of time that you would have the house paid off in 5 years or that you would be selling the house before the 5 years is over you could confidently take the adjustable rate mortgage credit cards on the other hand also typically have variable rates   these rates can change every month but they are usually calculated on some formula determined ahead of time   for example on my credit card the interest rate is the published prime rate plus   on my last statement it said the rate was   of course because i pay my balance in full each month i do n't pay any interest   the rate could go up to 50 for all i care as i said i do n't know what determines the rate on your variable rate student loan option and i do n't know what the limits are   if it climbs up to 11.5 that is obviously ridiculously high   i recommend that you try to pay off this student loan as soon as you possibly can however if you are not planning on paying off this student loan early you need to try to determine how likely the rate is to climb if you want to pick the variable rate option

the reason is that although the american economy is functioning normally mortgage rates are stupid low and are below a prudent expectation of long term 30 year rates of return in the market    i manage endowments so i say prudent in the context of endowment investment which is the picture of caution and subject to law the p being prudent     what 's more there are tax benefits   yes you pay 15 long term capital gains tax on investment income   but your mortgage interest is tax deductible at your tax bracket rate of 25 28 or 33 this being the tax you would pay on your next dollar of earned income   and in the early years of a mortgage mortgage payments are nearly 100 interest   so even if it 's a wash you gain $ 10k in the market but pay $ 10k in mortgage interest you pay $ 1500 tax on the gains but the interest deduction tax by $ 2800 so you are still $ 1300 ahead    tldr the government pays us to do this

refers to a fund that tracks the msci all country world index which is   a market capitalization weighted index designed to provide a broad measure of equity market performance throughout the world the msci is maintained by morgan stanley capital international and is comprised of stocks from both developed and emerging markets   the ex us in the name implies exactly what it sounds this fund probably invests in stock markets or stock market indexes of the countries in the index except the us mkt refers to a broad market index which in the us means that the fund attempts to track the performance of a wide swath of the us stock market wider than just the s&p 500 for example the dow jones u.s. total stock market index the wilshire 5000 index the russell 2000 index the msci us broad market index and the crsp us total market index are all examples of such an index this could also refer to a fund similar to the one above in that it tracks a broad swath of the several stock markets across the world i spoke with bny mellon about the rest and they told me this employee benefit a bank collective fund for erisa qualified assets daily liquid provides for daily trading of fund shares sl securities lending fund engages in the bny mellon securities lending program non sl non securities lending fund does not engage in the bny mellon securities lending program i 'll add more detail employee benefit refers to plans that fall under the employee retirement income security act which are a set a laws that govern employee pensions and retirement plans this is simply bny mellon 's designation for funds that are offered through 401(k 's and other retirement vehicles as i said before refers to daily liquidity which means that you can buy into and sell out of the fund on a daily basis there may be fees for this in your plan however sl securities lending often refers to institutional funds that loan out their long positions to investment banks or brokers so that the clients of those banks brokerages can sell the shares short this article has a good explanation of how this procedure works in practice for etf 's and the procedure is identical for mutual funds an exchange traded fund lends out shares of its holdings to another party and charges a rental fee running a securities lending program is another way for an etf provider to wring more return out of a fund 's holdings revenue from these programs is used to offset a fund 's expenses which allows the provider to charge a lower expense ratio and/or tighten the performance gap between an etf and its benchmark

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

for 3x it 's about 114 and for 4x 144 which naturally is twice 72   these are close back of napkin results with smart phone apps offering scientific calculators you should get comfortable just taking the root of a number for a more precise answer   update in response to brick 's comment the rule of 72 says that to double your money it answers both questions how much time do i need given a rate and how much return do i need given a time   logic tells me that if 72 is the number to double 144 is the but i 'm a math guy and my logic might not be logical to op so   let 's take the 20th root of 4    this is the key to use 4 hit key 20 equals the result is or and this is the precise rate you 'd need to quadruple your money in 20 years now 20 = which rounds to 144 rule of 144 to quadruple your money   this now answers op 's question how to derive a rule of x for a return other than doubling   one more example i want 10x my money of course i need the initial guess to enter one calculation people like 8 in general it 's a bit below the 10 long term s&p return and a good round number the rule of 72 says 9 years to double so 18 years is 4x and 36 years is for my initial calculation i 'll use 40 years the root of 10 i get again the precise rate that gives 10 fold over 40 years and multiplying this by 40 i get a rule of 237 which i 'm tempted to round to 240   at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = 9.99 at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = you can see that you lose some accuracy for the sake of a number that 's easier to remember and manipulate 72 to double is pretty darn accurate so i 'll stick with rule of 237 to get 10x my money    to close the purpose of these rules is to create the tool that lets you perform some otherwise tough calculations away from any electronic device of course i know how to use logs and in real life i 'm paid to explain them to students who are typically glad when that chapter is over i 've shown above how the rule of x can be formulated with a power root key which for most people is simpler ironically log calculations as offered force a continuous compounding which may not be desired at all it would give a result of 230 for my 10x return example and the following using the first equation he offered at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = which is further away from the desired 10x than my 237 or rounded 240

it depends on what kind of pension you get and your anticipated retirement income   if you have one of those nice defined benefit plans that pays 90 of your last 5 years average salary annually you might not want to bother with a separate rrsp and put your money into other use instead while most canadians should worry about not having enough to retire on some might end up with too much and costing them in the form current purchases and entitlements to government retirement benefits figuring out how much you need for retirement is not trivial either   a lot of people talks about planning for needing 70 of what you made now as a way to preserve your lifestyle   well my opinion is that those type of generalization might work for the people in the middle of the income band and is too little for those in the low income and possibly too much for those with high income   my own approach is estimate your retirement income requirement by listing out your anticipated expenses as if you were doing budget   i would agree that 's not the best approach either back to my comment about no one size fits all but it 's one that i feel most comfortable with once you have that figure factor in what you think you will get from the government oas cpp and etc and you will have the amount of money you need for retirement   i will warn against using average life expectancy to forecast your retirement needs 50 of the people will end up with extra money not a bad problem and the other 50 will run out of money bad but very true problem if you use that approach instead of going on and write an essay on this topic i will simply say this everyone 's situation is different and just like solving any other complex problems you need to start with end in mind and work things backward with a ton of different scenario to be able to cope with whatever life might throw at you   if you spend enough time in the library bookstore looking through books on the topic of estate planning and retirement planning you will find people arguing back and fro on these topics this is a sign that this is complex and no one has the one good answer for   do a bit of reading by yourself and if still unsure or just want to be sure go spend the money and review your plan with a fee only advisor   they will be able to provide another opinion on your situation after thoroughly studying your situation

think about how loans work for you personally   when you charge a $ 50 dinner for two to your visa card you did not earn $ 50 in income   you did not pay income tax on that $ 50   the money you use to pay back that $ 50 at the end of the month is not tax deductible     interest on a loan is a business expense     repayment of principal is not a business expense just as receiving the loan in the first place is not business income    effectively this means the llc repays the loan with after tax dollars   just like you do with your visa card   when i do corporate accounting payment of loan interest shows up on the expense side of the profit loss statement and it makes the balance sheet net assets go down    however payment of loan principal is effectively null   it does n't appear on the profit loss at all and it 's a wash on the balance sheet as both assets and liabilities fall by the same amount

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

go on a website that has real estate listings   find similar homes in the same neighborhood and list out the prices   once you have prices pick out two with different prices and call the realtor of the more expensive listing   tell that realtor about the other listing and ask why their listing is more expensive   compare their answer to the home that you are considering buying    for example they may say that their house has a newly remodeled kitchen   does the house you are considering have a newly remodeled kitchen   if so then use the higher priced listing and throw out the cheaper one   if not use the cheap listing and throw out the expensive one    or they might say that the expensive house is in a better location than the cheaper house   further away from traffic   easier to get to the highway or public transportation   if so ask how the location compares to the house you are actually considering   the realtor will tell you if the listings are comparable    when i talk about similar homes i mean homes that are similar in square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms   generally real estate sites will allow you to search by all of these as well as location    after all this the potential seller may still turn you down   if he really wanted to sell he 'd have suggested a price   he may just be seeing if you 're willing to overpay   if so he could turn down an otherwise reasonable offer   how much he is willing to take is up to him    note that this would all be easier if you just bought a house the normal way   then the realtors would do the comparables portion of the work   you might be able to find a realtor or appraiser who would do the work for a set fee   perhaps your bank would help you with that as they have to appraise the property to offer a mortgage    you asked if you can buy out a mortgaged house with a mortgage   yes you can   that 's a pretty normal occurrence   normally the realtors would make all the necessary arrangements   i 'm guessing that a title transfer company could handle that

it depends how you do it   if you roll it from your 401k directly to a roth then you will have to pay the taxes   the contributions to the 401k are tax deferred   meaning you do not owe taxes on the money until you collect it   roth contributions are post tax but the gains are not taxed so long as they are disbursed under acceptable conditions according to the regulations if you roll it directly from the 401k to a regular tax deferred ira you should be able to do that with out penalties or taxes   you will still have to pay the taxes at disbursement if you have the money disbursed to you directly then you will have to pay the penalties fees and taxes   your contributions to an ira will then be subject to limitations based on the ira   it will literally be exactly like you are taking money from your pocket to invest in the ira    your company should give you the option of a rollover check   this check will be made out to you but it will not be able to be deposited in a regular account or cashed   it will only be redeemable for deposit into a retirement account that meets the regulatory requirements of the 401k rollover criteria   i believe the check i received a few years ago was only good for 60 days   i recall that after 60 days that check was void and i would receive a standard disbursement and would be subject to fees and penalties   i am not sure if that was the policy of price or if that is part of the regulation

just pick a good bond and invest all your money there since they 're fairly low risk no that is basically throwing away your money and why would you do that and who told you they are low risk that is a very wrong premise what factors should i consider in picking a bond and how would they weigh against each other quite a number of them to say assuming these are n't government uk etc how safe is the institution issuing the bond their income business they are in their past performance business wise and the bonds issued by them if any check for the bond ratings issued by the rating agencies read the prospectus and check for any specific conditions i.e. bonds are callable bonds can be retired under certain conditions what happens if they default and what order will you be debt take priority where are interest rates heading which will decide the price you are paying for the bond and also the yield you will derive from the bond how do you intend to invest the income coupon you will derive from the bonds what is your time horizon to invest in bonds and similarly the bond 's life i have invested in stocks previously but realized that it is n't for me bonds are much more difficult than equities stick to government bonds if you can but they do n't generate much income considering the low interest rates environment now that qe is over you might expect interest rates to rise but you can only wait or go for bonds from stable companies i.e. ge walmart and no i am not saying you buy their bonds in any imaginable way

that is kind of the point one of the hopes is that it incentivizes banks to stop storing money and start injecting it into the economy themselves compared to the european central bank investing directly into the economy the way the us central bank has been doing the federal reserve buying mortgage backed securities on a country level individual european countries have tried this before in recent times with no noticeable effect

i agree with your strategy of using a conservative estimate to overpay taxes and get a refund next year as a self employed individual you are responsible for paying self employment tax which means paying social security and medicare tax for yourself as both employee and an employer current social security rate is 6.2 and medicare is 1.45 so your self employment tax is 15.3 assuming you are single your effective tax rate will be over 10 portion of your income under $ but less than 15 $ so to adopt a conservative approach let 's use the 15 number   given self employment and federal income tax rate estimates very conservative approach your estimated tax can be 30 self employment tax plus income tax should you expect much higher compensation you might move to the 25 tax bracket and adjust this amount to 40

i personally found the for dummies books on property investment very helpful and a great primer i found them unbiased and very informative laying out the basic principles depending on your knowledge it can provide you with enough of a foundation to have an informed conversation with banks real estates etc   watch the markets for a while at least 6 months to know what prices vendors will be expecting and rents tenants will be expecting most property magazines will also contain a suburb summary in the back   when you get closer to purchase make sure to ask your bank for the rp data reports on the properties you are looking at the banks will typically provide these for free i also set out some points for myself which i made clear for myself at the beginning this might provide a good starting point and really narrow down your research options as generic research on property investment can be overwhelming i ended up with a 3 in western sydney that has so far happily paid for itself building a good relationship with real estate agents and attending lots of open homes auctions and talking to other investors can only help   i was once told if you attend free property investment seminars you will always learn at least one new thing be it statistics methodologies finance options etc with that in mind always keep a level head leave your wallet at home and do n't sign up to anything   at the end of the day keep a cool head do n't stop reading and rush nothing

while the politicians delay dealing with the issues of immigration reform surely they could get together on the limits on h1b visas for young educated foreign workers   yes surely they could get together on the limits on h1b visas for young educated foreign workers and thereby throw even more older tech workers out of work as you can see from the first graph and table at the top 11 users of h1b visas in 2013 were companies heavily involved in outsourcing and as you can see from the third graph and table at over 80 percent of initial h-1b hires are under 35   few of those high tech firms pushing to increase or abolish the limits on h1b visas even suggest that we need have any concern for u.s. workers perhaps workers and other citizens should reward those tech companies by giving them a taste of their own philosophy ignore any suggestion that we give any to tech products made in the u.s. and buy only foreign products that will help build the foreign competition giving those foreign workers places closer to home at which they can work that may dry up the supply of cheap foreign labor and cause u.s. companies to treat their u.s. workers a little better and to paraphrase the pro h1b philosophy why should we buy a product made in the u.s. when a more qualified one is available from a foreign country

i strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by january 15 2014 you will receive forms 1099-misc from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you a copy will go to the irs also you file a schedule c with your form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-misc forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than $ 600 for which a 1099-misc does not need to be issued or tips say if you are a taxi driver running your own cab and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income including tools books or gasoline etc that you bought for doing the job you will need to file a schedule se that will compute how much you owe in social security and medicare taxes on the net income on schedule c. you will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee 's share but also the employer 's share at least you will not have to pay income tax on the employer 's share your net income on schedule c will transfer onto form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe and then add on the social security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid you will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013 plus   interest on the tax paid late   send the irs a check for the total if you talk to an accountant right away he she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe and sending in that amount by january 15 will save some money the accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above

in a comment you say   if the market crashes does n't regress to the mean mean that i should still expect 7 over the long run that being the case would n't i benefit from intentionally my portfolio and going all in on equities i can can still rebalance using new savings no   regress to the mean just tells you that the future rate is likely to average 7   the past rate and the future rate are entirely   consider a series    the running average is   that running average is slowly to the long term mean without ever a member of the series being above 7    real markets actually go farther than this though   real value may be increasing by 7 per year but prices may move differently   then market prices may revert to the real value   this happened to the s&p 500 in 2000 2002   then the market started climbing again in 2003   in your system you would have bought into the falling markets of 2001 and 2002   and you would have missed the positive bond returns in those years   that 's about a annual shift in returns on that portion of your portfolio   since that 's a third of your portfolio you 'd have lost 8 more than with the balanced strategy each of those two years    note that in that case the market was in an over valued bubble   the bubble spent three years popping and the actual value   so 2003 was a good year for stocks   but the three year return was still   in retrospect investors should have gone all in on bonds before 2000 and switched back to stocks for 2003   but no one knew that in 2000   people in the know actually started backing off in 1998 rather than 2000 and missed out on the tail end of the bubble    the rebalancing strategy automatically helps with your regression to the mean   it sells expensive bonds and buys cheaper stocks on average   occasionally it sells modest priced bonds and buys over priced stocks   but rarely enough that it is a better strategy overall    incidentally i would consider a 33 share high for bonds   30 is better   and that should n't increase as you age less than 30 bonds may be practical when you are young enough   once you get close to retirement five to ten years start converting some of your savings to cash equivalents   the cash equivalents are guaranteed not to lose value but might not gain much   this gives you predictable returns for your immediate expenses   once retired try to keep about five years of expenses in cash equivalents   then you do n't have to worry about short term market fluctuations   spend down your buffer until the market catches back up    it 's true that bonds are less volatile than stocks but they can still have bad years   a 70%/30 mix of stocks bonds is safer than either alone and gives almost as good of a return as stocks alone   adding more bonds actually increases your risk unless you carefully balance them with the right stocks   and if you 're doing that you do n't need simplistic rules like a 70%/30 balance

there are few cases where trades were reverted because of a technical issues for example when bats did its ipo its price went down to a few penny due to a computer glitch because of that the regulators allowed the trades to be reversed as if nothing happened i think that some trades during the flash crash of the 6 may 2010 were reversed too however if the act is clearly fraudulent they can try to sue the responsible if a tribunal were to condemn him to reimburse them and that he has enough money to pay for it they could get their money back but think of madoff the people that invested with madoff did n't have their investment reversed as madoff did n't have the money to pay them back the goes with most of criminal crooks and even traders finally before thinking of reverting anything there are laws about financial firms to make them implements proper checks to avoid that kind of fraudulent activities as they are responsible for most of the operational risk especially when it could impact both the firm and their clients and if the firm does n't comply with those laws they are unlikely to get the tribunal on their side if a problem arise

yes you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses   how much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs   be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and if applicable your family   when buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices your decision hinges on whether or not you 'd qualify for a premium subsidy   if your agi is below 400 of the poverty line you 'll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange   if the subsidy is not meaningful to you or you would n't qualify you can buy an off exchange plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though it 's somewhat rare   in order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically if your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via cobra or you live in a state that extends the cobra requirement to smaller businesses you can choose that as well   bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans   it 's becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage   cobra is not a special type of insurance it 's a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2 10 for administrative fee popular there is no such thing as obamacare or aca coverage   obamacare the insurance market   the aca outlines certain minimum coverage requirements generally referred to as minimum essential coverage   while employers and plans are not required to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with non compliance   the single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements   the penalty is harsh enough that it 's not worth the cost of offering a non compliant plan whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange through an insurance agent or via your employer 's cobra program you will have aca coverage unless on the off chance your employer 's plan does n't check the minimum essential coverage box   so generally all plans available to you will have $ 0 preventive coverage pregnancy benefits cancer treatment benefits etc another thing to consider is your entire family does n't need to be on the same plan   if your family is healthy with the exception of one child you can purchase $ 0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family in fact you could choose cobra for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family   the things to consider when you face a lay off i tried to mitigate my use of all and always because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements such as the hobby lobby decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain benefits   understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans

by the sounds of things you 're not asking for a single formula but how to do the analysis and for the record you 're focusing on the wrong thing you should be focusing on how much it costs to own your car during that time period not your total equity   formulas   i 'm not sure how well you understand the nuts and bolts of the finance behind your question you may just be a pro and really want a consolidated equation to do this in one go so at the risk of over specifying i 'll err on the side of starting at the very beginning any financial loan analysis is built on 5 items 1 of periods 2 present value 3 future value 4 payments and 5 interest rate   these are usually referred to in spreadsheet software as nper pv fv pmt and rate each one has its own excel google docs function where you can calculate one as a function of the other 4 i 'll use those going forward and spare you the real math equations   layout if i were trying to solve your problem i would start by setting up the spreadsheet   up with column a as period i would put this label in cell a2 and then starting from cell a3 as 0 and going to n 5 year loans will give you the highest purchase value w lowest payments so months but you also said 48 months so do whatever you want   then i would set up two tables side by side with 7 columns each yes seven starting in label the cells columns as rate car value loan balance payment paid to interest principal and accumulated equity then select and copy cells as the next set of column headers beginning in i usually skip a column to leave space because i 'm like that numbers now you need to set up your initial set of numbers for each table we 'll do the older car in the left hand table and the newer one on the right let 's say your rate is 5 apr put that in cell not then in cell type = 1/12 car value $ 12,000 in cell then type down payment in cell and put 10 in cell d1 and last in cell put the formula = this should leave you with a value for the first month in the rate car value and loan balance columns now select and paste those to the right hand table the only thing you will need to change is the car value to $ 20,000 as a check you should have 12,000 on the left and then 20,000 18,000 on the right   formulas again this is where spreadsheets become amazing if we set up the right formulas you can copy and paste them and do this very complicated analysis very quickly   payment the excel formula for payment is = nper pv fv fv is usually zero so in cell type the formula = 60 0 obviously if you 're really doing a 48 month 4 year loan then you 'll need to change the 60 to 48 you should be able to copy the result from cell to and the formula will update itself   for the 60 months i 'm showing the 12 k k loan has a pmt of $ the k loan has a pmt of   interest the easiest way to calculate the interest is as = that 's outstanding loan balance x periodic interest rate put this in cell since you do n't actually owe any interest at period 0   principal if you pay pmt each month and x goes to interest then the amount to principal is pmt x so in type = the minus in front of is because excel 's pmt function returns a negative amount if you want to feel free to type = for the formula that 's actually in it 's your call   i get for the amount to principal in period 1   accumulated equity as i mentioned in the comment your equity comes from your initial loan to value and the accumulated principal payments so the formula in this cell should reflect that there are a variety of ways to do this the easiest is just to compare your car 's expected value to your loan balance every time in cell i3 type = that 's your initial equity in the car before making any payments copy that cell and paste it to you 'll see it updates to = automatically right now that is zero those cells are empty but we 're getting there the important thing is that as jb king pointed out your equity is a function of accumulated principal and equity which depreciates this approach handles those both   finishing up the copy and paste formulas i know this is long but we 're almost done   rate period 1 in cell type =   payment period 1 in cell type =   loan balance period 1 in cell type = your loan balance at the end of period is reduced by the principal you paid i get   car value period 1 this will vary depending on how you want to handle depreciation if you ignore it you 're making a major error and it 's not worth doing this entire analysis   just buy the car and move on with life but you also do n't have to get it scientifically accurate go to someplace like edmunds.com and look up a ballpark i 'm using 4 depreciation per year for the old 12 k car and 7 for the newer car however i pulled those out of my ass so figure out what 's a better ballpark   in type depreciation and then put 4 in in type depreciation and then 7 in now in cell put the formula =   paste formulas to flesh out table as a check your row 4 should read 1 45 if so you 're great copy cells and paste them into   these will update to be 75   if you 've got that then copy and paste it to you 've built a full amortization table for your two hypothetical loans congratulations   making your decision i 'm not going to tell you what to decide but i 'll give you a better idea of what to look at i would personally make the decision based on total cost to own during that time period plus a bit of x factor for which car i really liked   look at period 24 in columns i and q. these are your equities in each car if you built the sheet using my made up numbers then you get old car equity as new car equity is if you 're only looking at most equity you might make a poor financial decision   the real value you should consider is the cost to own the car not necessarily operate it during that time total cost = ending equity payment x 24 upfront cash   for your old car that 's 24 1,200 = for the new car that 's 24 2,000 =   is one good or bad up to you to decide there are excel formulas like that can consolidate some of the table mechanics but i assumed that if you 're here asking you would have gotten stuck running some of those   here 's the spreadsheet

hi there i 'm a tesla owner i think for the model s and x segment currently buying cars you 're right is n't the first and foremost thing in their mind however that is n't to say being environmentally conscious is n't a credit they should receive for their purchase because other informing factors like charging at home instead of needing to refuel is a perk and it reduces oil gas usage i did n't buy my car to lower my carbon footprint as buying an ev does n't necessarily do so in the big picture i do however love the fact i can charge my car at home and never visit a gas station every day i get in my car with a full tank and i 'm one less paying customer at the pump    as far as a status symbol for me it 's the opposite i do n't want a iconic vehicle that people will at me over i 'm fairly low key i 'd rather not have the attention i just needed wanted a car with great interior cargo space but was an electric vehicle i could charge at home the chevy bolt vw fiat and other ev options did n't fit the bill for me also and most importantly i wanted a vehicle that 's future at least for a few years to offer full self driving capability the moment it was allowed tesla became the icon for offering attractive electric vehicles at a time when most available options looked phoned in   remember what you said in your first post $ loan for a car they 've never seen and many wo n't receive for well over a year a lot of people myself included never saw the official prototype until after we made our reservations on march 31 2016 so the notion that it 's purely an icon seems incomplete i will say this though as soon as other auto makers take the ev market seriously and design cars that actually look attractive i think you 'll see the tesla demand drop for those who are looking for ev options pure and simple   i think in the next few years as more ev makers step up what will differentiate the vehicles is the underlying tech in the car first and foremost closely followed by design aesthetic tesla will retain buyers if they beat everyone to market with an available fully self driving capable vehicle but they 'll see some of that market shift away if other makers break in

the number one difference is that bank savings accounts or money market accounts allow limited checking six non atm withdrawals per month max else possible fees have fdic insurance up to $ 250,000   however do n't put that much in allow some room for interest so you never go over the $ 250,000   money market mutual funds do not enjoy fdic insurance   there may be some insurance generally against brokerage failure though but its coverage is questionable search out those details and if they apply to anything besides actual cash held at the brokerage   if the money market mutual fund is strictly invested in us treasury securities like t bills or other short term us treasury instruments it enjoys the full faith and credit of the us government fwiw but many invest in corporate instruments   if the fund has any pricing issues there might be a delay in getting paid off   extremely unlikely       number two and more importantly bank savings accounts or pay way more   you can get a bit over 1 apy now many paying 0.90 apy or higher   no money market mutual funds are close to that generally yielding a small fraction of that almost zero for us treasury mmm funds   sure 1.05 ai n't too exciting but you may as well get the most you can if holding cash and fully insured to boot

yes theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit but you 're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways   in practice it 's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it 's currently listed for and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference   yes the price could drop to $ 28 but it could just as easily drop to $ or further and now you 're hurting before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not   one of you has to lose   and unless you 've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser long term is quite likely to be you now that said it is possible particularly when selling puts to create win win scenarios for yourself where you 're betting one direction but you 'd be perfectly happy with the    here 's an example   suppose unrelated to the option chain you 've come to the conclusion that you 'd be happy paying $ 28 for bby   it 's currently june 2011 at so you ca n't buy it on the open market for a price you 'd be happy with   but you could sell a $ 28 put promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it presumably because the price is now below $ 28 either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you 're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates or the option is executed and you receive 100 shares of bby at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay   even if the list price is now lower long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $ 28   conceptually this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself of course you could be wrong in your estimate too low and you now have a position that might not become profitable too high and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value but that is not unique to options if you 're bad at estimating value which is not to be confused with predicting price movement you 're doomed just about whatever you do

i 'd encourage you to use rules of thumb and back of the envelope here are some ideas that could be useful the problem with any kind of detailed calculations is the number of unknowns there are some really complex calculators out there for example see caution horrible user interface but seemed to work that will include all kinds of factors and run monte carlo and the whole thing but in my opinion it 's just as good or better to say save at least 15 of income until you have 25x what you spend or some other such rule of thumb here 's my little blog post on savings and investing fwiw http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ another note there 's sort of an ideology of how to live embedded in any retirement recommendation and you might want to take the time to reflect on that and consciously choose a book on this topic is your money or your life by robin which is a sort of radical you should save everything possible to achieve financial independence as early as possible argument i did n't go for their plan but i think it 's thought provoking a newer book that may be more appealing is called the number   and it 's about your question exactly it 's more designed to get you thinking while your money or your life has a particular answer in mind both have some math and some rules of thumb though they are n't focused on that a kind of general takeaway from these books might be first think about your expenses what are you trying to accomplish in life how would you like to spend your time and then ask how much money you absolutely need to accomplish that and focus on accomplishing your goals spending your time as much as you can on what you 'd like to spend it on i 'm this with a generic recommendation to save enough to spend 80 of your income in retirement which this idea that you should spend as much as possible every year before and after you retire lots of people do like that idea but it 's not a law of the universe or something it 's just one popular approach

the answer to your question has to do with the an explanation of shares authorized issued and outstanding companies in their articles of incorporation specify a maximum number of shares they are authorized to issue for example purposes let 's assume facebook is authorized to issue 100 shares let 's pretend they have actually issued 75 shares but only 50 are outstanding aka float i.e. freely trading stock in the market and stock options total 25 shares so if someone owns 1 share what percentage of facebook do they own you might think 1/100 or 1 you might think or 1.3 or you might think or 2   2 is the answer but only on a non diluted basis so today someone who owns 1 share owns 2 of facebook tomorrow facebook announces they just issued 15 shares to whatsapp to buy the company   now there are 65 shares outstanding and 90 issued now someone who owns 1 share of facebook own only or 1.5 down from 2 p.s. valuation can be thought of as the price of the stock at the time of the purchase announcement

right the definition of made with 100 chicken changes depending on whether that particular company sources soy protein and chicken separately and mixes them vs purchasing it already mixed the consumer does n't care if this particular company is putting the chicken and the soy together all they care about is what 's in the package that 's what i mean by the fact that at some level everything with chicken is made with 100 chicken legally they ca n't say that it 's made with 100 chicken unless one of the items they purchase from a supplier is just chicken but morally biologically and logically it is the same whether they put the chicken into their mixing pot or an upstream supplier does   lets take a concrete example this breakfast products sandwiches smoke chicken sausage egg whites and cheese sandwiches is made with 100 chicken obviously the entire food product is not chicken but i would n't be surprised if someone walking down the aisle and picking it up thought subconsciously that the patty on it was 100 chicken is it actually no it is chicken and water and other stuff but what we are actually supposed to infer from that language is that the company who makes this sandwich purchases 100 chicken whatever that is and mixes it with the rest of the ingredients to made something which is mostly chicken in legal land that is all that can be inferred from the statement it 's not exactly deceptive but it 's definitely not the clearest terminology that could be employed and it definitely implies something that simply made with chicken does not imply   i agree with you that the package almost always has all the information i would reasonably want on it though and in many cases it is obvious that same sandwich lists all of the ingredients of the patty on the back so the information is right there if you want to go to the small text

in the unlikely case that noone finds a way to extract resources from the company and distribute them to shareholders periodically in a way that 's de facto equivalent to dividends any company can be dissolved the assets of the company would be sold for their market value the liabilities would have to be settled and the net result of all this company cash + sale results liabilities would be distributed to shareholders proportionally to their shares the liquidation value is generally lower than the market value of a company as an ongoing concern that 's making business and earning profit but it does put a floor on it 's value if the stock price is too low someone can buy enough stock to get control of the company vote to dissolve it and make a profit that way and the mere fact that this can happen props up the stock price companies could even be created for a limited time period in the first hand which has some historical precedent with shareholders of trading companies with lifetime of a single trade imagine that there is some company where shareholders want to receive $ 1 m of its cash as dividends they can make appropriate contracts that will form a new company called that will take over all the ongoing business and assets except $ 1 m in cash and then liquidate and distribute it 's assets shares of and the dividend among themselves the main difference from normal dividends is that in this process you need cooperation from any lenders involved so if the company has some long term debts then they would need agreement from those banks in order to pay out dividends oh and everyone would have to pay a bunch more to lawyers simply to do dividends in this or some other convoluted way

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

in the united states you ca n't because the average millennial in the united states has no opportunity to save money either you get a college education then you will be burdened with a student loan the cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades it is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents or you skip college but college is the only way in the united states to obtain a generally accepted qualification so you wo n't get any job which pays enough to save any money as soon as that student loan is paid off you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades as soon as the house debt is paid off you will be old and develop some medical problems the medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again so when in their life are millennials supposed to save money

here 's my view as a old who grew up in auckland when you purchase a residential property whether or not you intend to live in it you 're essentially counting on the possibility that one of the following will occur this report by the nz royal society going by memory from a presentation i attended predicts ongoing population growth in nz mainly driven by immigration and mostly in auckland building of new housing is n't keeping up with population growth so my bet would be that the property values especially in auckland are going to continue to climb   other factors that might influence your decision are things only you can know such as where you might be likely to settle down how much risk you 're willing to take how much capability you have to look after a rental property and how much knowledge you have about the property market bear in mind that government schemes and world events may change the outlook for number of houses being built and immigration levels both of which heavily affect property values my personal view is that the government is n't doing nearly enough to provide affordable housing for our young adults in nz not only that the govt is essentially responsible for the problem in the first place as zoning rules for local authorities artificially inflate land prices which prevent the building of affordable houses furthermore foreign investment in rental properties is unregulated and both these problems could be resolved with appropriate legislation though central city prices are unlikely to be relieved as much as other areas simply because prices are also inflated due to the desirability to live centrally the problem is a severe one and high housing prices for even the smallest are going to make inequality and the social problems that go with it far worse i 'd like to see new cities or towns being planned and built from scratch such as and

it is possible to pay down debt including interest without issuing new debt money to pay for it i think this is the heart of your question let me present a highly contrived example in which society has four people and one bank here is a bank with $ 100 in initial deposits total money supply in this society is $ 100 we assume there is no currency circulating since you 're interested in debt money this bank lends out $ 90 to bob at 1 year maturity and 10 apr bob spends this $ 90 with charlie to buy raw materials charlie deposits $ 90 in the bank the money supply just grew from $ 100 to $ 190 bob does something with the raw materials and adds some kind of value eventually selling the finished goods for $ 110 in our little silly economy the only people who have money are adam and charlie so we must assume that between the two of them they buy $ 110 worth of goods from bob let 's say adam buys $ 60 and charlie buys $ 50 the actual amounts do n't matter bob deposits this money at the bank still $ 190 of money supply at the end of 1 year bob instructs the bank to transfer payment from his deposit account to his loan account the bank wipes clean his debt and the money remaining in bob 's account represents his return who is this david guy he 's the owner of the bank he $ 9 in interest from the loan to bob and he pays $ 5 to adam as interest on adam 's deposit the remaining $ 4 is the profit to the bank 's owner money supply decreased from $ 190 to $ 100 after bob pays off his loan i realized after writing this the one thing i left out is where does adam get $ 100 to start with presumably adam starts off with some kind of currency either fiat money or commodity money iow debt money ca n't be created out of nothing it has to be expanded on top of some kind of currency

crank out expensive shares when markets are corporations go public sell their shares for the first time in market conditions that have a lot of liquidity a lot of people buying shares and when they have to make the concessions to appease an investing public when people are greedy and looking to make money without using too much due diligence think 's ipo in 1995 or snapchat 's ipo in 2017 they also issue more shares after already being public in similar circumstances think tesla 's 1 billion dollar dilution in 2017 dilution results in the 1 share owning less of the company so in a less investing environment share prices go down in response to dilution see 's stock for an example if you can find a chart issue debt non financial companies create bonds and sell bonds why is that surprising to you cash is cash this is called corporate bonds or corporate debt you can buy apple bonds right now if you want from the same brokers that let you buy stocks mutual fund investor bernstein is making a cynical assessment of the markets which carries a lot of truth dumping shares on your mom 's 401k is a running amongst some financial professionals basically mutual fund investors are typically the least well researched or most gullible market participants to sell to influenced by brand name more than company fundamentals who will balk at the concept of reading a prospectus financial professionals and have more information than their investors and can gain extended advantages because of this just take the emotions out of it and make objective assessments

william r is a momentum indicator used for measuring overbought and oversold levels it is not used to predict the price of a stock in fact william r like all momentum indicators is a lagging indicator meaning the indicator level changes as the price of the stock changes it ranges from 0 to -100 usually when a reading is less than the stock can be considered to be oversold and when the reading is above -20 the stock can be considered overbought when viewed together with the price chart this can help provide a trader with entry and exit points into and out of a trade

you can not have off campus employment in your first year but investments are considered passive income no matter how much time you put into that effort obviously you need to stay enrolled full time and get good enough grades to stay in good standing academically so you should be cautious about how much time you spend day trading if the foreign market is also active in a separate time zone that may help you not to miss class or otherwise divert your attention from your investment in your own education i have no idea about your wealth but it seems to me that completing your degree is more likely to build your wealth than your stock market trades otherwise you would have stayed home and continued trading instead of attending school in another country

unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company which you would be working for there are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly and you should definitely consult an ria registered investment adviser before investing in something that is n't extremely standardized traded on an major exchange the issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized in terms of legal structure settlement terms registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are theoretically given specific training to understand these kinds of non standard investments and are theoretically qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these make well informed investment decisions and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme   there are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups what of the the company 's profits are you entitled to how long can the company go without paying you a dividend do they have to pay you a dividend at all how liquid will your investment in the company be unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business and other non standard contract clauses for example some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business this makes your investment essentially worthless the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend if you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either the probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow   overall the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned if you want to invest in companies on build a relationship with an ria and work with that person to invest your money it is easier less risky and not all that more expensive

if they had told me that i owe them $ 10,000 from 3 years ago i    would n't have anything to fight back why first thing you have to do is ask for a proof have you received treatment have you signed the bill when you were done this should include all the information about what you got and how much you agreed to pay do they have that to show to you with your signature on it if they do n't you owe nothing if they do you can match your bank credit card insurance records those are kept for 7 years at least and see what has been paid already can a doctor 's office do that they can do whatever they want the right question is whether a doctor 's office is allowed to do that check your local laws states regulate the medical profession is there a statute of limitation i 'm just guessing that forces them    to notify me in a certain time frame statute of limitations limits their ability to sue you successfully they can always sue you but if the statute of limitations has passed the court will throw the suite away provided you bring this defense up on time of course without a judgement they can not force you to pay them they can only ask nicely as the law quoted by mrchrister mandates they can trash your credit report and send the bill to collections though but if the statute of limitations has passed i doubt they 'd do that especially if its their fault i 'm not a lawyer and you should consult with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction for definitive answers and legal advice

a lot of people on here will likely disagree with me and this opinion    in my opinion the answer lies in your own motives and intentions    if you 'd like to be more cognizant of the market i 'd just dive in and buy a few companies you like   many people will say you should n't pick your own stocks you should buy an index fund or this etf or this much bonds etc   you already have retirement savings capital allocation is important there   you 're talking about an account total around 10 of your annual salary and assuming you have sufficient liquid emergency funds there 's a lot of non monetary benefit to being more aware of the economy and the stock market   but if you find the house you 're going to buy you may have to liquidate this account at a time that 's not ideal possibly at a loss if all you 're after is a greater return on your savings than the paltry 0.05 or whatever the big deposit banks are paying then a high yield savings account is the way i 'd go or a cd ladder yes the market generally goes up but it does n't always go up   get your money somewhere that it 's and you can be certain how much you 'll have tomorrow assuming a gain the gain you 'll see will pale in comparison to the deposits you 'll make   deposits grow accounts   consider these scenarios if you allocate $ 1,000 per month to this account    1 assuming an investment return of 5 you 're talking about $ 330 return in the first year not counting commissions or possible losses 2 assuming a high yield savings account at 1.25 you 're talking about $ 80 in the first year    also remember both of these amounts would be taxable i 'll admit in the event of 5 return you 'll have about four times the gain but you 're talking about a difference of on $ 12,000   over three to five years the most significant contributor to the account by far will be your deposits    anyway as i 'm sure you know this is not investment advice and you may lose money etc

the reason is n't because of the gold standard the real reason is because we have seen a sharp increase in fruit imports over the past 5 decades   huh agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   is up rather dramatically as compared to 40 years ago maybe you mean manufacturing   productivity is up since say the turn of the century but this is to be expected since we incorporated electricity oil automobiles and eventually computers    but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    that means the growth in productivity    you can see this best here   think of productivity like gdp it used to be 5 and was on its way to 6 but right as we went off the gold standard productivity increases stagnated and by 2007 we 're only at 5.5 instead of the expected 6 this uses a logarithmic function wherein 6 is 10x more than 5 so while productivity has not fallen in an absolute sense growth in productivity which is more important than absolute gdp growth has fallen and is infact related to a decrease in productivity growth   gt;the reason you 're seeing the gains over the past several years shifting towards the rich is due to a combination of tax policy and a rise in cronyism caused by our campaign financing problems big businesses often have a lot of lobbying power to get laws passed that ultimately are felt by the rest of the economy    the reason it has shifted to the rich is because as the currency has debased the gains have gone towards the biggest companies wealthiest individuals assisted by government which works like an auction house to those with connections which is why lobbying roi is huge   currency is a good thing for countries like the united states we can safely finance and pay our debts for a few more years while up debt without fear of hyperinflation    because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems hyperinflation of commodities and deflation of assets are before our eyes house values are plummeting medical education consumer goods are inflating not quite to the hyper part but inflation is increasing and only when commodities such as oil see a deflation in demand as we see right now does inflation look under control shadow inflation is very much alive   if you have dollars in savings the rates do not even outpace inflation you are forced into riskier and investments to make a return   gt;now there may be a lot to gripe about how the united states is currently spending its money but it 's established practical fact that government investment can spur growth level out recessions help people etc   established over what the last 40 years that s hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years infact no fiat currency that has ever existed has survived that is the real fact and the dollar and euro themselves are currently going through the end stages of this cancer    the gold standard sucks it has a lot of problems fiat currency rocks for the usa because usa fuck yeah we are in a particular advantage where the real risks of fiat currency do n't really apply to the usa   55 million on food stamps with 20 30 million more on other forms of government assistance such as unemployment and welfare unemployment increasing gdp growth decreasing median income decreasing total employment stagnant same number of full time wage earners exist today as in 2000 despite 30 + million more american citizens decreased consumer confidence average age of cars on the road went from 5 years in the 1960s to 12 years today people do nt buy new cars as frequently meaning less disposable income decreased home ownership increased retirement age decreased young american employment   i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs

just a word of warning most of the companies that promise to repair your credit are scams or close to them   you could just as easily do yourself what they are going to charge you for essentially they write a letter to the credit agencies disputing most or all of the bad stuff on your credit report when you do that the credit agency sends an inquiry to the company that reported the negative information requiring them to justify it if that company does n't respond within x days they remove the item from your credit report these companies depend on the fact that some companies are n't going to hit that deadline or even respond perhaps they are just too busy to hassle with providing backup documentation for a $ 20 late payment they are banking on getting a few of these cheap outs to your benefit and charging you for what amounts to sending out a bunch of form letters if you do n't mind writing a bunch of letters then you can save a lot of money and get the exact same results these companies want to pretend they have some insider knowledge or fancy lawyers that know special credit magic but they generally do n't the only option i 'd consider legitimate and not a waste of your time is a referral from the non profit national federation for credit counseling they are n't going to fix your credit but will give you advice on budgeting and repairing your credit on your own

gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   this is because value is a subjective term intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value   the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value   intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with anything that exists in reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star   an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value is the opposite of intrinsic

dude you are over analyzing this way too much   the fact of the matter is if someone is sketchy enough to help you rob a bank their character and judgement is suspect   it ca n't be that hard to find a group of 4 5 people who are n't stupid i can think of a dozen friends of mine off the top of my head i 'd have complete confidence in if we decided to rob a bank   this sentence is a bit of a fallacy in of itself after reading the linked article above   you want to find 4 5 people who are n't stupid that will rob a bank   we just read about how the return on bank robbery is complete garbage so anyone who would think it a good idea is de facto stupid   chances are someone who was willing to commit such a large crime will be willing to commit other possibly smaller crimes   and if you think there 's any loyalty among criminals you are incredibly naive

i would suggest they are not wasted because your premiums fund unemployment insurance which is a net to prevent people from going under if they lose their jobs unemployment insurance is in many ways an for success because it allows an entrepreneur to take more risk in starting a business because failure wo n't mean devastation perhaps that person who took the risk because of the ability to fail started the business that you now work for society works better in my opinion by keeping the bottom closer to the top   paying into the unemployment insurance fund indirectly provides you opportunity

in how much trouble can i get exactly if the irs finds out i    understand that there 's a 6 year statute of limitations on criminal    charges and no limitation at all on fraud is this considered fraud    i 'm assuming not there 's no statute of limitations for fraud which is a criminal charge the statute of limitations is for failure to report income which is not fraud in your case since you willingly decided to not report it knowingly that you should it can most definitely account for fraud so i would n't count on statute of limitations in this case i should amend my taxes for those years that would be the easiest way to go would the irs go all the way and file criminal charges considering the amount of money i owe they have the legal right to and if you do get caught likely they will easy money for them since you obviously have income and can pay all the fines and penalties practically speaking what 's the worst case scenario theoretically can be jail as well being charged in a criminal court even if the eventual punishment is just a penalty is a punishment of its own you 'll have troubles finding jobs passing security checks getting loans approved etc for $ 3200 when you 're in 25 bracket as an individual for years i 'd say not worth it

the mortgage i got last year through wells fargo explicitly indicates in its terms that excess payment will be considered against future payments i.e. pay $ 500 extra in january and you owe $ 500 less in february unless indicated otherwise it goes on to state that with electronic payments you do not get to specify where excess payment goes so excess payment made electronically always goes toward future payments if you want to make excess payments toward principal you must actually send them a check and your payment stub with the appropriate box   this wo n't be very different for other major banks i would n't imagine

depending on who you trust the social security fund should still be liquid for another 40 to 70 years or so which should cover the life expectancy of most boomers   as for what happens after that well there does n't seem to be a plan for that yet a plan would require making some unpopular choices politicians would be forced to do something with negative political ramifications in the short term to offset a problem that is n't going to explode until long after they have left office and shuffled off this mortal for most it just is n't worth the political fallout   what is likely to happen the same thing that is happening now the government is no stranger to spending money it does n't have the national deficit and debt prove that convincingly of course we are now approaching debt levels we have n't seen since wwii from the combined efforts of two concurrent wars and bailing out every industry that can afford to hire a lobbyist and overuse of the old politician 's trick of buying votes by spending people 's own money on them and pretending to be   something is going to have to give my best guess is that the following will happen in this order 1 increase then eliminate the caps on how much income you have to pay ss taxes on 2 raise the age when you can start collecting ss checks 3 stop paying people ss checks if they exceed a certain income at retirement age 4 stop paying people ss checks if they exceed a certain net worth 5 reduce the amount people get in ss checks    of course another baby boom or drastically increasing the amount of legal immigration would also stave off the problem for a while

an emergency fund is about managing risk what would you do if your furnace water heater and cars all broke down at the same time being in michigan i can imagine that you would n't want to take cold showers heat the entire house by wood fire and walk to work every day so how do you manage this risk what would happen if you lost your job and could n't find one for a few months by only having $ 5k in the bank in an emergency fund you are putting your family at risk if these sorts of things happened you would be in trouble you would have to borrow money either hurting equity in the home that you have worked hard to build up or by some other means you and your spouse should sit down and decide what a good emergency fund looks like for your family a reserve of 3 6 months of expenses is a good emergency fund this could cover your family in the event of a lost job while you look for a new one it would also cover you when murphy strikes and things break down all at the same time once you and your spouse have determined how much you want to set aside you two must determine how you will get there maybe you put in some extra hours at work maybe you lower the retirement contributions temporarily maybe you try to pay off the car as quickly as possible then put what you were paying on the car into the emergency fund it will likely take a mix of things to get you there you do n't have to get it done in a day a month or even a year but once you have that emergency fund fully funded you will feel better what may be a catastrophe now will be a minor annoyance with a fully funded emergency fund finally i 'd recommend going to your bank and setting up a separate account for this emergency fund a separate account specifically labeled as your emergency fund this way you will think twice before spending it on a non emergency

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

it 's always a good move for risk averse person in europe because houses are not represented by number in an index therefor if you are risk adverse you will suffer less pain when house prices go down because you wo n't have a number to look at everyday like the s&p500 index because houses in europe germany italy spain are almost all made by concrete and really well done string real marble cover hard ceramic covers copper pipes compared to the ones in us the house will still be almost new after 30 years it will just need a repaint and really few cheap because on the long run years are guaranteed to rise in price in dense places like big city ny san francisco etc the reason is simple the number of people is ever growing in this world but the quantity of land is always the same moreover there is inflation do you really think that 30 years from now building a concrete house will be less expensive than today do you think the concrete will cost less do you think the gasoline that moves the trucks that bring the concrete will be less expensive than now do you think the labour cost will be less than now so 30 years from now building an house will be much more expensive than today and therefor your house wil be more expensive too on the run stock market do not guarantee you to always increase the us stock market have always been growing in the long run but japan stock market today is at the same level of 30 years ago guess what happened to you if you invested your money in the japan stock market 30 years ago your friend bought an in japan 30 years ago he would now be rich and you would now be poor

in financial markets the gains you can expect to make whether in the form of dividends or capital gains correspond to the risks you are bearing   there are a variety of reits but you can expect to make only as much money in them as you bear risk meaning you can also lose a lot of money in the ones that earn a lot   in that sense they are just like other financial assets like stocks if you are generically trying to increase your wealth by bearing risk you can get a better risk reward ratio in a fully diversified portfolio including stocks and bonds as well and reits   passive income means making money by bearing risk   reits alone without diversifying into other financial assets do a poor job of generating income for the amount of risk you bear so why are reits not very comparable to buying a house and renting it out   because in the latter case you are being paid not only for bearing the risk of the house depreciating but also you are being compensated for the work you do as a landlord   moreover because the house does n't trade in a liquid market like reits do it is possible to actually get a good deal as opposed to the fair deal you will get on a reit tl;dr the passive income generated by reit investment is more similar to generic equity bond investment than it is to an investment in a physical home that you rent out   if what you want is to make money without doing anything besides bear risk you should invest in a fully diversified portfolio of financial assets equity and bonds being the primary constituents but reits potentially being a part as well

the loan itself is not tax deductible unless you took it as part of a mortgage anyway it 's just a regular loan   mortgage and student loan interest deductions are special cases explicitly given tax deductible status other loans are not deductible unless part of a business expense or other qualifying reason if this were a short sale which you note it was not but included for completeness sake and some of your debt was cancelled that may have tax implications   you can not take a capital loss on your personal residence so the loss itself is not deductible

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally

you 're missing the cost of carry aspect the cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity such as grain or metals over a period of time the carrying charge includes insurance storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs in interest rate futures markets it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument so in a nutshell you 'd have to store the gold safely invest your money now i.e. you 're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date   well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to london or wherever the agreed delivery place is edit forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices do n't diverge so the idea is n't that bad as i might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself i should that profits are small and is highly automated so before you spot a $ 1 profit somewhere between any two contracts you can be quite sure it 's been taken by an already

i 've been prompted to turn my comments into an answer   disclosure i am a realtor i work for an investor for whom an offer on a house he will buy describes him as a cash buyer this phrase most often means one of two things   the buyer has funds that are liquid enough to either wire the cash or produce a cashier 's check in some number of days a week or two would be common and not wait for another house to sell the other point of this is that the seller is not willing to finance the property the flip side being that the seller will take a down payment and let the buyer pay over time   i am nearly 54 and i 'm open to the fact that language changes definition follows usage in personal finance we refer to a stock bond cash mix here the word cash simply means money such as money market or short term t bills a mix does n't mean i have a of cash under my bed for that 10   to answer the op i 'd ask the seller does cash mean keep in mind when a seller has a buyer who needs to sell their home first there can be a chain going a few levels when it 's turtles all the way down it becomes too risky to the seller   no you are not out of luck i 'd open a dialog with the seller or their agent if any sales is all about understanding what each person 's goal is

here is the answer for 3 from my brokerage your math is correct typically option traders never take delivery of the stock simply to then turn around and sell it at the higher price that the stock is trading at you wold always expect the option to have a higher value that simply selling the stock at market price there are many factors involved in options pricing and the math behind it is quite complicated but unless it is right at expiration the option will have a higher price than the stock itself

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

it may not be an ideal option but you could use an hsa as a tax sheltered investment vehicle    the contribution limit is only $ for an individual and $ for a family in 2015 plus $ 1 k if you 're 55 + so you 're only making up a small portion of the 401(k limit   also you and a family member to get the higher contribution limit have to be covered by a qualifying high deductible health insurance plan hdhp to be eligible to make hsa contributions   as such it may not be the best option if you regularly incur significant medical expenses   and in many cases the investment fees in an hsa are higher than you would find in a 401(k or ira the investment choices can be limited so it is important to research the options before selecting a provider all that being said the contributions and growth are both tax deferred tax free if you use it for healthcare then at age 65 or medicare eligibility you can withdraw the funds without penalty and pay only income tax even if they are not used toward healthcare expenses

that question makes assumptions that do n't hold in general as to why to deal with futures   well there 's just one contract per maturity date not a whole chain of contracts options come at different strike prices   that in turn means that all the liquidity is in that one contract and not scattered across the chain then moreover it depends what underlying contracts you 're talking about   often especially when dealing with commodities there is no option chain on the spot product but only options on the futures contracts in summary the question is somewhat bogus   options and futures evolved historically and independently and were not meant to be by one another   so their rights and obligations are just a historical by product and not their defining feature   i suggest you refine it to a specific asset class

depending on your income you may owe amt instead of the taxes from the regular code   even if you do n't do that you may hit the place where you have to at least check if you owe amt as you probably know amt was established early on to catch the wealthiest of tax payers who were able to use various loop holes in the code to pay much less tax than one would expect   over time the limits on amt have not risen with the rising wage gap and amt catches an increasing number of tax payers each year   if the limit is not raised at all for 2010 then it will catch even more people this year    amt has worked it 's way into the upper middle class fairly solidly especially if you exercise stock options whose strike price is significantly different than the current sale price

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

bp holdings management on taxes and thier original intents is designed to generate enough revenue to sustain essential public service such as public safety civil infrastructure for communication and transportation and basic health services when you see a government hospital you know your taxes support the upkeep of that institution and when you see soldiers fighting in you can be sure tax went into training them and keeping them fit and equipped to preserve our national security    as essential as tax is to our national existence many do not know the true value of what taxes can do other than what we have mentioned above here are some generally unknown facts about taxes and what you need to do to make full use of their benefits    1 taxes should not favour one group over another   taxes are intended to be neutral and must not cater to any one sector or group of people over another neither should it impose or interfere with individual decision making    what this signifies is that taxes as they were originally conceived had an altruistic purpose meant to benefit people equally without favoring any individual or any societal unit it is a fund to provide services and public amenities for all people alike so whether you earn only so much or make millions you walk or drive over the same road or bridge that taxes helped to build we can not discount the goodwill and welfare taxes have brought to both ancient and modern societies   pay your taxes so you can enjoy them    2 taxes must be predictable    in order for a government to function well it must have some stability in terms of its fiscal health without the necessary funds to run a government chaos would ensue and so taxes must flow into a state ’s coffers at a regular schedule and at a reasonably predictable amount or the oil will run out at a time when the engine of progress badly needs it    now we understand why the state imposes and does not merely request that taxes be paid at a particular time of the year why april for many countries it is the time of the year when people have probably paid off last year ’s debts or recovered from the expenses of the holiday season in the previous year it is also the time when most parents have extra cash because their children are on school vacation unfortunately it is also the time when many people want to spend a vacation so it is either you pay your tax or spend a nice vacation during spring for most people    3 taxes must be simple   assessment and computation of tax and determination should be easily understood by the average taxpayer but this has been forgotten by tax officials in recent years it has not only become more complex in terms of schedule as the tax calendar seems to nowadays it has also become so hard to decipher through the many pages now incorporated in the tax return the best thing to do if you have extra cash is to let an accountant do your tax    4 taxes must not be forced but enforced to encourage voluntary compliance   the key is convenience as much as possible it is the tax duty to encourage voluntary compliance among taxpayers through creative implementation without making people feel they are being harassed or unduly burdened ordinary taxpayers have to go through a lot of stress figuring out forms and lining up to pay their tax perhaps a more convenient way can be implemented using modern technology and the banking system if we can pay bills in malls or online now why can not tax be paid in the same way    5 taxes earmarked for specific purposes must result in direct benefits   certain taxes such as gasoline tax for road maintenance must be dedicated to the particular purpose they were intended based on a direct cost benefit link today much of the corruption in government circles arise from taxes or diverting them from their intended purposes thus losing sight of the original intent of the tax    what can the taxpayer do to prevent these things from happening aside from joining protest rallies or talking to your congress representative you can actually form or join small groups that could create awareness among people through the media or internet this is already being done on facebook and twitter how effective it is may be hard to measure but time will come when a critical mass of concerned people will have a force of a virtual army that can change the tide of events in a society    inevitable as taxes may be enjoying their ultimate benefits can be a much better motivation that spending our time looking for ways to avoid them

it sounds like you want to lock up your money in something relatively safe and relatively hard to touch you may want to consider a gic td has one i found in a quick search from what i see it 's the closest thing to a us cd you wo n't get much back but if you pick a 5-year term you ca n't spend it easily other options might be to buy an etf or get into reits but that will depend on your risk comfort also to add from the comment rick left be sure to pay off any high interest debts especially if they 're on a credit card it will help you later on easily you can withdraw but there 're generally penalties

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

yes you can do this yourself   i can not speak for all the credit repair companies but generally they are not reputable   even if they are trustworthy they can not do anything you can not do yourself freeze your credit   lock it down and prevent any new activity   this is for safety and i want you to do it so you know where you stand get a copy of your free copies of the three credit reports from this is the only free official place to get your reports sign up for a free credit score estimation site like http://www creditkarma.com or http://www   these sites make money by selling affiliate offers but you can easily ignore them   you ca n't get your exact fico score but they letter grades they provide help you understand where you stand dispute anything that is not accurate   get wrong items corrected with the credit agency ignore collectors who are not showing up on your report   if they are n't reporting you so what   let your own moral compass be your guide if you pay those debts or not negotiate a payment amount with the debtors you owe   if you are dealing with a debt collector there is n't any point in paying the full amount   you owed the money to somebody else and they sold it to the debt collector therefore in my mind they are as whole as they feel like being   it is up to you how much you pay but you are already going to suffer   and have suffered the credit ramifications   no sense in wasting money when they will very likely settle for dimes on the dollar   do n't let them bully you around   i suggest understand your rights and protections as offered by the fair debt collection practices act before you pay anybody anything get it in writing wait and follow up   make sure they report it correctly i would probably tackle them in order of age newest first    do n't bother with debts that are more than or nearly seven years old   anything that old is or will fall off of the credit report soon and your score will start to rise   paying on those debts will refresh them and they will harm you longer   we can debate the ethics of that advice in the comments but if you want your score to raise i suggest just waiting about anything over six years old while you tackle the newer ones this is a slow process   your credit score will still take a couple years to heal once you fix your report   but that is the point of the score after all   it is a history of how you handle money and debt

so people deposit money with you you agree to pay them fixed back and then you invest money for your own profit sounds like a bank to me   or a dividend paying mutual fund or a number of other similar ideas   sure you 're welcome to start something like that up it 's unlikely you 'd get money from people unless you had already proved yourself competent as an investor though   after all if it 's possible to get a safe comfortable 5 why would anyone give you money at 2 or 3 instead of just getting that 5 for themselves   or more likely finding a competitor who gives 4.9 as in most things the market will find inefficiencies like this and squash them like bugs    that said there are some opportunities that take advantage of other kinds of situations   the most common i 'd say is owning a home   you take out a mortgage for 80 of the value of the home instead of buying it outright and you instead invest the 80 in the market   you likely will beat your mortgage rate given the current rates   that 's effectively doing the same thing with an expense you 'd have anyway you always have to live somewhere since it 's a secured loan you get better rates than the market will give as it 's quite safe and you can use tax laws in your favor mortgage interest deduction in particular and the capital gains break on primary residences

i would recommend reading intelligent investor first it was written slightly more recently than security analysis 1934 more important is that a recently revised edition of intelligent investor was published the preface and were written by warren buffett intelligent investor is more practical as an introduction for a novice you may decide not to read security analysis at all as it seems more like an academic text or professional 's guide i.e. for accounting benjamin graham 's intelligent investor remains relevant it is used successfully as a guide for value investing despite the of market sentiment and day to day variations even extreme volatility for example i just read a nice article about applying the value investing principles in intelligent investor a few weeks ago it was written in the context of current markets which is amazing to be so applicable despite the passage of decades for reference you might want to glance at this book review published in march 2010 of the original 1934 edition of security analysis      the url links to a one paragraph summary by u.s. news world report it does not link to a book sales website

i 'm going to post this as an answer because it 's from the gofundme website but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it   am i responsible for taxes us only while this is by no means a guarantee donations on gofundme are    simply considered to be personal gifts which are not for the most    part taxed as income in the us however there may be particular    case specific instances where the income is taxable dependent on    amounts received and use of the monies etc      we 're unable to    provide specific tax advice since everyone 's situation is different    and tax rules can change on a yearly basis we advise that you    maintain adequate records of donations received and consult with your    personal tax adviser      additionally wepay will not report the funds    you collect as earned income it is up to you and a tax professional    to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income the    person who 's listed on the wepay account and ultimately receives the    funds may be responsible for taxes      again every situation is    different so please consult with a tax professional in your area en us i responsible for taxes us and here 's a blurb from which adds to the confusion but enforces the speak with a professional idea crowdfunding services have to report to the irs campaigns that total    at least $ 20,000 and 200 transactions money collected from    crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift this is where things get a little tricky if money donated is not a    gift or investment it is considered taxable income even a gift could    be subject to the gift tax but that tax applies only to the gift    giver non taxable gifts these are donations made without the expectation of getting something    in return think of all those fans who gave money to    gofundme to help the cost of tom ’s nfl fine    for those fans are n’t expecting anything in return    except maybe some satisfaction so their donations are considered    gifts under irs rules an individual can give another individual a    gift of up to $ 14,000 without tax implications so unless a fan    is particularly generous his or her gofundme gift wo n’t be taxed taxable income now consider that same fan donating $ 300 to a business    venture if the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return    for the donation this is considered an investment and is not taxable    however if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the    company the money donated could be considered business income and the    recipient would need to report it on a tax return

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

to supplement ben 's answer following smart money utilizes information available in a transparent marketplace to track the holdings of professionals   one way may be to learn as much as possible about fund directors and monitor the firms holdings closely via prospectus i believe certain exchanges provide transaction data by brokers so it may be possible for a well informed individual to monitor changes in a firms holdings in between prospectus updates   an example of a play on smart money   s&p500 companies are reviewed for weighting and the list changes when companies are dropped or added as you know there are etfs and funds that reflect the holdings of the sp500   changes to the list trigger   binary events where funds open or close a position some people try to anticipate the movements of the sp500 before smart money adjusts their positions i have heard some people define smart money as people who get paid whether their decisions are right or wrong which in my opinion best captures the term this course may be of interest

so many answers here are missing the mark   i have a $ 100k mortgage because that is n't paid off i ca n't buy a car   that 's really misguided logic you have a reasonably large amount of college debt and did n't mention any other it 's a really big deal what kind of debt this is   is it unsecured debt through a private lender is it a federal loan from the department of education let 's assume the worst possible reasonable situation   you lose your job and spend the next year plus looking for work   this is the boat numerous people out of college are in far far far far more than the unemployment rates indicate   federal loans have somewhat reasonable indentured servitude but i digress repayment strategies you can base the payment on your current income through income based and income continent repayment plans   if you 're through a private lender they still expect payment   in both cases because the us hit students with ridiculous lending practices your interest rates are likely 5 10 or even higher given your take home income is quite large and i do n't know exactly the cost of living where you live you have to make some reasonable decisions   you can afford a car note for basically any car you want   what 's the worst that happens if you ca n't afford the car   they take it back if you can afford to feed yourself house yourself pay your other monthly bills you make so much more than the median income in the us that i really do n't see any issues what you should do is write out all your monthly costs and figure out how much unallocated money you have but i 'd imagine you have enough money coming in to finance any reasonable new or used car   keep in mind new will have much higher insurance and costs but if you pick a good car your headaches besides that will be minimal

your biggest concern will be what happens during the transition period in the past when my employer made a switch there has been a lockout period where you could n't move money between funds then over a weekend the money moved from investment company a to investment company b. all the moves were mapped so that you knew which funds your money would be invested in then staring monday morning you could switch them if you did n't like the mapping no money is lost because the transfer is actually done in $ 's imagine both investment companies had the same s&p 500 fund and that the transfer takes a week if when the first accounts are closed the s&p500 fund has a share value of $ 100 your 10 account has a value of $ 1000 if the dividend capital gains are distributed during that week the price per share when the money arrives in the second investment company will now be $ 99 so that instead of 10 shares $ 100 you now will buy shares $ 99 no money was lost you want that lookout period to be small and you want the number of days you are not invested in the market to be zero the lockout limits your ability to make investment changes if for instance the central bank raises rates the number of days out of the market is important if during that period of time there is a big price increase you would n't want to miss it of course the market could also go lower during that time

no it is never impossible to get credit so long as there are no price controls or quotas in most of the united states the impetus for housing is so strong that it 's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation price in this case being interest rates corporate banks will not touch you now because dodd frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage   also fannie freddie who ultimately finance most mortgages in the us now require banks to buy back loans if they fail so banks are only financing the most creditworthy all is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully they find a way through in your case you can get a fully financed mortgage if you 're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit if the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state the interest rate will be even lower your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions   if you shop around you 'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get also since the cost of your prospective home is so low it 's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $ 50,000 the fha has been vastly expanded and since your individual credit is clean there may be a chance to get financing through it but be prepared for red tape

what the automation mostly does is make short term trading that much more difficult day trading is a zero sum game so if they win more everyone else wins less   long term trading years to decades is a positive sum game the market as a whole tends to move upward for fairly obvious reasons at its basis it 's still investing which in turn is based on lending and as long as folks make fairly rational decisions about how much return they demand for their investment and the companies are mostly producing profits there will be a share of the profit coming back to the investors as dividends or increased share value or both day to day churn in individual stocks gets averaged out by diversification and time and by the assumption that if you 've waited that long you can wait a bit longer if necessary for to settle out time periods between those will partake of some mix of the two

in a way this is good because it encourages people to move out of these high cost areas to lower cost over time that will tend to even out the problem and move resources around the country anyone waiting for nyc to become cheap again is just plain stupid it did n't even get cheap in the 2008 crash

i say to always say yes when asked to loan money to a friend or family member as long as you have the money to do it with that is the key having th to do it with and do n't expect to get it back ever if you do great when you do n't your expectation was met although not often i 've lent money to friends and most of the time have been paid back $ 10 $ 300 more for the times when i was not i do remember but i do n't hold it against the person money is only money after all friends are precious and worthy of your aid support and respect if they were n't then one must ask if they are really a friend i have also had to borrow money once for a non trivial amount my family who can easily afford it refused but a friend helped me at a critical juncture i offered to make a contract but my friend said no pay me back when you can i have tried to start paying back a couple of times but my friend refused telling me to wait until i was more financially stable if i am ever lucky enough to be in the position my friend is in i will emulate this behavior and do the very same thing and love doing it all the while

i understand that baby boomer retirement is a factor but when you stated there are more jobs than ever it does n't really support the idea that we do n't have an unemployment crisis looming   in other words the fact that there are more payroll positions does n't play into the effectiveness of the us 's employment strategy if it even has one after all it 's trivial to show that the number of part time positions is booming while full time positions are contracting surely you do n't think that every part time job has the same economic benefit as a full time job   even without a burger making robot we have a problem with enough work being available for our populace if when food prep hit the big time we 're going to collectively flush out the part timers that are the only section of the workforce that actually has been increasing in positions what then    i keep hearing people make comparisons to previous manufacturing or technological revolutions like buggy going away as automobiles came online but those comparisons are fundamentally flawed as they did n't involve replacing the human they involved augmenting humans with better and better tech we still needed the human   now we face a major where we are replacing the humans hands and brains with machinery we simply do n't need the human any more they just get in the way   it 's a fundamentally different proposition than we have faced before

we 're in our fifth year of business   we never had a business plan and never took out a loan   we started tiny and grew to be small   many of our competitors have left the field mostly due to debt and a local market that can be very hard to predict   i like this guy 's focus on entrepreneurship for low income people   for most of us if you can start a business that ends up being a fairly decent paying job for yourself and maybe a couple other people that 's good enough   jobs for average people are disappearing but those with the dedication and discipline can scratch out an alright living running their own show

if you are going to keep your us bank account for any period of time the very best option i know of is to withdraw euros from an atm using your us card once you are in germany     i draw on my us account regularly i 'm in and always get the going mid market exchange rate which is better than what you get from a currency conversion service transfer agency or bank transfer and there are no fees from the atm or my bank for the currency conversion or withdrawal    of course you should check with your bank to verify their rules and fees for atm use internationally   it would also be wise to put a travel advisory on your account to be sure your transaction is not denied because you are out of country

i always thought that it was strange that within a few minutes of meeting him a friend of mine who is a part time model was offered a job and then was being flown to london paris a few weeks later   i mean maybe this is completely irrelevant and perhaps that 's just how it works but i always found it strange that she had his private number on her phone   surely he has people to handle those kinds of things

first stock prices forecasts are usually pretty subjective so in the following resources you will find differing opinions the important thing is to read both positive and negative views and do some of your additional research and form your own opinion to answer your question some analysts do n't provide price targets some just say buy sell hold and others actually give you a price target yahoo provides a good resource for collecting reports and giving you a price target

nope take the match   i can not see not taking the match unless you do n't have enough money to cover the bills every situation is different of course and if the option is to missing minimum payments or other bills in order to get the match make your payments   but in all other circumstances take the match my reasoning is it is hard enough to earn money so take every chance you can   if you save for retirement in the process all the better

seems to me that a private business ought to have the right to do exactly this and more if they wish   they do not owe anyone a job nor is the applicant obligated to work there   if they wish to make religious adherence color gender attractiveness or whatever a condition of employment they should be free to do so   however if they do   a they should never be eligible for any tax funded business such as contracts   b they should not be entitled to special state privileges such as incorporation   before any of you start about how very intolerant this is let me point out that we are to be equal before our goverment not in our private lives   no individual 's freedoms are more valid or important than another 's   the rights of say a woman or person of color or gay person can not be more important than the rights of say a religious person that wants as in this to fill their company with like minded people   the right of association is fundamental in a free society   forcing one person to hire someone against their will is immoral   let the whiny left begin their foolishness

not everything is about marginal utility and trying to define people by their marginal utility is almost sociopathic     guess what labor is n't that interchangeable and markets are far from perfect   what is the other option other than government help   let these people starve and live on the street because they ca n't afford anything else   that is a great way to ruin a society
