not really no the assumption you 're making withdrawals from a corporation are subject to ordinary income tax is simplistic income tax encompasses many taxes some more benign than others owing to credits and exemptions based on the kind of income moreover the choices you listed as benefits in the sole proprietor case the rrsp the tfsa and capital gains treatment for non registered investments all remain open to the owner of a small corporation the rrsp to the extent that the owner has received salary to create contribution room a corporation can even at some expense establish a defined benefit db pension plan and exceed individual rrsp contribution limits yes there is a more tax efficient way for small business owners to benefit when it comes time to retirement here is an outline of two things i 'm aware of if your retirement withdrawals from your canadian small business corporation would constitute withdrawal from the corporation 's retained earnings profits i.e. income to the corporation that had already been subject to corporate income tax in prior years then the corporation is able to declare such distributions as dividends and issue you a slip statement of investment income instead of a t4 slip statement of remuneration paid dividends received by canadian residents from canadian corporations benefit from the dividend tax credit dtc which substantially increases the amount of income you can receive without incurring income tax see non eligible small business dividend tax credit dtc quote for a single individual with no income other than taxable canadian    dividends which are eligible for the small business dividend tax    credit in 2014 approximately $ could be earned before    any federal taxes were payable provincial vary and so combined federal provincial maximums vary see here if you 're wondering about non eligible vs. eligible private small business corporation dividends are generally considered non eligible for the best dtc benefit but they get some benefit while a large public corporation 's dividends would generally be considered eligible eligible non eligible has to do with the corporation 's own income tax rates since canadian small businesses already get a big tax break that large companies do n't enjoy the dtc for small businesses is n't as good as the dtc for public company dividends finally even if there is hardly any same year income tax advantage in taking dividends over salary from an active small business corporation when you factor in both the income tax paid by the corporation and the individual dividends still allow a business owner to smooth his income over time which can result in a lower lifetime average tax rate so you can use your business as a retained earnings piggy bank to spin off dividends that attract less tax than ordinary income but if you can convince somebody to buy your business from you then you can benefit from the lifetime capital gains exemption of up to $ 800,000 on qualifying small business shares i.e. you can receive up to $ 800 k tax free on the sale of your small business shares this lifetime capital gains exemption is a big carrot designed i believe to incentivize canadian entrepreneurs to develop going concern businesses that have value beyond their own time in the business this means building things that would make your business worth buying e.g. a valued brand or product a customer base intellectual property etc of course there are details and conditions with all of what i described and i am not an accountant so please consult a qualified conflict free professional if you need advice specific to your situation

agreed a philosophy of and provoking trade wars with former trade allies is the preferred approach for the trump administration however closing borders to imports is likely to have a very high offsetting cost for us exports    it all seems very shortsighted just based on what canada and the uk are likely to do in response to just this decision alone will certainly cost companies like boeing and lockheed martin a lot more in exports than they will ever gain through this maneuver

the only real option long term is for businesses to move to other areas and re distribute the population which would allow for cheaper areas homes to become viable options   this has actually begun to happen really not many people may be aware yet of what 's occurring in nevada today   apple just joined tesla and switch in announcing billion dollar investments in virginia city nevada google also made huge land purchases the tech population has begun moving into cheaper areas already and many people will follow to cheaper homes and lower costs of living   all people are to blame for this real estate situation everyone is just looking out for themselves and they are all concentrating in specific areas naturally costs will rise   re distributing the population geographically businesses + wealth will relieve this kind of stress happening in focused areas

echoing and assuming you mean the physical rather than abstract meaning of money   the abstract concept obviously is n't replaced unless the currency is discredited or like the creation of the euro which saw local currencies abandoned the actual bits of paper are regularly collected into bits and destroyed   coinage tends to last a lot longer but it also collected and melted down eventually depends on the country though   no doubt many people who took a gap year to go travelling in points diverse came across countries where the money is a sort of brown grey you hold with care in thick the more modern economies replace paper money on a dedicated cycle around three years according to wikipedia anyway

wikipedia has a solid article on money market funds which includes a section on breaking the buck when the money market fund fails to return its full dollar   money market funds smoothing out the daily generally small fluctuations of investing in short term treasuries directly but have similar risk over longer periods   some funds can and have lost money in market crashes though even the worst performers still returned 95 + cents on the dollar while few investments are guaranteed and likely none in your retirement account   money market funds are likely the choice you have with the least fluctuation and similar minimal risk to short term treasuries however a second important risk to consider is inflation   money market funds generally have returns similar or less than the inflation rate   while money markets funds help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market the value of your retirement account falls behind the cost of goods over time   unless the investor is fairly old most financial professionals would recommend only a small portion of a retirement account be in money market instruments   vanguard also has a set of target retirement investment funds that are close to what many professionals would recommend   consulting a financial professional to discuss your particular needs is a good option as well

you 're right to be a bit afraid for lack of a better term   it 's a guarantee that some crooked people will try to screw you and running a business in virtually any industry is getting more and more competitive everyday   but if you 're savvy enough to call people out on their and willing to compete you can succeed with a solid business model       the two main reasons people do n't try and start a small business of their own all the time are 1 because they 're too lazy or do n't have the drive and 2 do n't have the start up capital   believe me i 've met some fellow successful business owners that could n't pass a freshman undergrad level business law course     do n't get me wrong there is always risk involved with a new venture   but if you 're committed to learning how to streamline your service and operations then market it effectively you 'd probably be okay   the legal side of things will really play an extremely likely negligible small part in your day to day life once you 've gotten them out initially

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

the victim never actually receives the money so that is not an option the scammer generates the transaction using a fraudulent check once the check is found to be fraudulent the chain of involved banks claw the money back which is the bank 's money not the scammer 's so what happens is the victim sees a deposit in their account but it is not real it is a conditional deposit by the bank made on the assumption that the payment is good which it is not when the victim endorses a check they are guaranteeing to the bank that they consider the check good and for the check that is why the bank credits the victim 's account because the victim has for the check when the check later turns out to be fraudulent the victim owes the bank money in theory people who endorse a fraudulent check could be criminally prosecuted but that does not happen normally

i do n't know what country you live in or what the laws and practical circumstances of owning rental property there are but i own a rental property in the u.s. and i can tell you that there are a lot of headaches that go with it one maintenance you say you have to pay an annual fee of 2,400 for building maintenance does that cover all maintenance to the unit or only the exterior i mean here in the u.s. if you own a condo we call a unit like you describe a condo if you rent it it 's an apartment if you own it it 's a condo you typically pay an annual fee that cover maintenance from the walls out that is it covers maintenance to the exterior of the building the parking lot any common recreational areas like a swimming pool etc but it does n't cover interior maintenance if there 's a problem with interior wiring or plumbing or the carpet needs to be replaced or the place needs painting that 's up to you   with a rental unit those expenses can be substantial on my rental property sure most months the maintenance is zero things do n't break every month but if the furnace needs to be replaced or there 's a major plumbing problem it can cost thousands and you can get hit with lots of expenses while my place was vacant i turned the water heater down to save on utility expenses then a tenant moved in and complained that the water heater did n't work we sent a plumber out who quickly figured out that she did n't realize she had to turn the knob up then of course he had to hang around while the water heated up to make sure that was all it was it cost me umm i think $ 170 to have someone turn that knob but i probably saved over $ 15 on the gas bill by turning it down for the couple of months the place was empty two what happens when you get a bad tenant here in the u.s. theoretically you only have to give 3 days notice to evict a tenant who damages the property or fails to pay the rent but in practice they do n't leave then you have to go to court to get the police to throw them out when you contact the court they will schedule a hearing in a month or two if your case is clear cut like the tenant has n't paid the rent for two months or more you will win easily both times i 've had to do this the tenant did n't even bother to show up so i won by default so then you have a piece of paper saying the court orders them to leave you have to wait another month or two for the police to get around to actually going to the unit and ordering them out so say a tenant fails to pay the rent in real life you 're probably not going to evict someone for being a day or two late but let 's say you 're pretty hard about it and start eviction proceedings when they 're a month late there 's at least another two or three months before they 're actually going to be out of the place of course once you send them an eviction notice they 're not going to pay the rent any more so you have to go four five months with these people living in your property but not paying any rent on top of that some tenants do serious damage to the property it 's not theirs they do n't have much incentive to take care of it if you evict someone they may deliberately trash the place out of spite one tenant i had to evict did over $ 13,000 in damage so i 'm not saying do n't rent the place out what i am saying is be sure to include all your real costs in your calculation think of all the things that could go wrong as well as all the things that could go right

from your description the taxes may have been withheld incorrectly you were most likely a nonresident alien during your entire stay teachers and which include anyone on j status who is not a student are exempt individuals exempt from the substantial presence test unless they have already been an exempt individual during any part of 2 of the prior 6 calendar years so if you have n't been in the u.s. as an f-1 j-1 etc for at least 6 7 years before you came on j-1 this time the first two calendar years of your time on j-1 this time does not count towards the substantial presence test you said you were there for 18 months that stretches over either 2 or 3 calendar years the first two calendar years of it would be exempt from the even if it stretched into a third calendar year an 18-month period could not stretch for more than 6 months into a 3rd calendar year so even in that case you would still not meet the substantial presence test for the 3rd year since you do not meet the presence test during any of those years you were a nonresident alien for all of those years unless you decided to file jointly with a resident spouse or something nonresident aliens on j-1 are exempt from fica taxes social security tax and medicare tax for employment as a researcher that you were authorized to do on your j-1 they should not have withheld fica taxes from you you should have informed them at the beginning when you initially noticed that they did because it is a huge pain to get it back afterwards for fica taxes withheld in error you can first ask the employer to refund them and if that fails get a written statement of their refusal and then file form 843 and form with the irs however given that irs is very underfunded these days expect it to take a long time to hear back if you ever hear back

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

there is no general theory to support the notion that larger companies will be more profitable than smaller companies   economies of scale are not always positive one can have of scale too    it is more common to talk about an optimal firm size even going back to 's the economies of scale   intuitively if economies of scale extended indefinitely then natural monopolies would dominate all industries in the long run a profit ratio unfortunately would n't quite get at scale economies   consider for example that the denominator of your metric would be and that you are trying to get at the cost reduction that derives from scale   then you are measuring the size of a company by the exact metric that should be reduced if scale economies exist so the calculation would be a bit it is my understanding that such assessments are usually conducted at the industry level by determining whether the industry is becoming increasingly concentrated among fewer firms over time again see    if concentration is increasing there is an implication that at current firm sizes there are economies of scale in the industry

no as a director normally you ca n't as a director of a limited company all those payments should be accounted for as directors remuneration and have been subject to paye and even if you are self employed currently there is no legislation which prevents a director from receiving self employment income from a company in which he is a director however the default position of hmrc 's is that all the payments derived from the are subject to paye in other words it 's possible only invoice from an business or in a consultancy role that 's not directly related to the trade of business but it really depends on the circumstances and the contracts in place sources at forum david at and at   more sources if a person does other work that ’s not related to being a director they may have an employment contract and get employment rights source employment status as director at gov.uk in principle it is possible for an employee or office holder to tender for work with their employer outside their normal duties in circumstances where that individual will not be providing service as an employee or office holder but as a self employed contractor where there is any doubt about whether service is provided constitutes employment or self employment see the employment status manual source section 62 2003 at hmrc

ditto just to get concrete i just checked one bank in india and they say they are paying 4 on savings accounts i do n't know what you 're getting or if 4 is typical in india but it 's at least an example so if the bank pays interest based on average daily balance and you left the money in the bank for a week you 'd get = so on rs 95,000 that would be rs 73 i live in the us where typical interest on a savings account today is about 1 so an equivalent amount of money i think that would be about $ 1,500 would get of 1 or 29 cents   do n't leave the lights turned on while you do the calculations you 'll spend more on the electricity than you make on the interest addendum this suddenly reminds me i read a news story a few years ago about a man who was expecting a tax refund check from the irs of a few hundred dollars and when the check arrived it was for several million well obviously it was a mistake but he came up with the clever idea deposit the check in an interest bearing account promptly contact the irs inform them of the mistake and ask how and where to go about returning the money hope that it takes at least a few days for them to figure everything out then keep the interest accumulated on the several million dollars for the time that he had the money and as he contacted them immediately about the error they ca n't say he was trying to hide anything it was a nice try but it did n't work they demanded he send them the interest as well as the principle

did n't lose your job you just had temporary employment   same as back in the late 1990 's when unemployment was really low a lot of people got jobs they really were n't qualified for and were paid far more at least on a scale relative to their co workers than they were really worth   the sad thing about that is that they came to believe they were truly worth that amount of money   the same with houses   my home bought in late 2000 increased in estimated market value by 75 i.e. to 175 of it 's previous sale price when i bought it and the bubble around here was n't anything like it was in other regions of the us and of course now it has ostensibly sunk back down to very nearly the price i paid for it   the problem for a lot of people with that is that even if they did n't buy during the peak bubble years they refinanced or based on that higher estimated value and so ended up basically removing and then spending the lion 's share of equity that they had built up in their house   for others it was much the same as the late 90 's employment they came to believe that their house was worth more and they have difficulty letting go of that illusory estimated market price   so they are experiencing the wealth loss effect just as they once experienced a wealth effect   i was saved from those things because    a i realized that the price of houses is always at the margin and is never guaranteed by what the place cost or what you have invested in it or even what the owner or mortgage company thought it was worth rather when you go to sell it will be determined by what the want are capable of paying    b i was far more concerned with what my total cost of buying would be including all of the interest paid on the mortgage this led me to first of all only buy what i needed in a house i.e. single guy = small place and secondly to pay the whole thing off asap which i did dramatically lowering the total lifetime cost of the place    and finally and probably most importantly though in part due to b above   c it does n't really matter to me whether the price goes up or down because i know that i will always need a place to live and that generally speaking due to overall market conditions the prices of all houses will tend to go up down together and though not necessarily in lock step there are always factors of neighborhood local economy housing trends etc but still should i desire to move i will essentially be able to trade my house for a similar one in a similar market with only a small 6 to 10 cost   d but i also know that if i move up market attempt to move to an area house that has a relatively higher demand higher price that i will then have to pay more or get an even smaller place smaller home less land no garage shop etc yet conversely if i for some reason decide to move down market to an area house with a relatively lower demand price i may be able to either pay less or to get slightly more house additional land etc   note i also took into account demographic changes when i bought and think i made the right choice even though it has n't played out yet with the typical household actually becoming smaller single parents fewer kids more retirees wanting to downsize etc i figured way back in 2000 that in 15 20 30 years circa 2015 2045 the big would be aging and in huge oversupply whereas smaller homes would be in relatively higher demand and given things like smart growth planning probably in lesser supply and so would be more likely to retain value   again this has n't played out yet though there definitely are signs that it is starting but i am also really not interested in selling so it 's a moot point at present and even if i am proved wrong it will probably merely prove to be the loss of an upside and not an actual loss per se

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

and the weird shit is that it 's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that   if there is lot 's of money around on people it means they can invest it on something that investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people   if there would be less money around the rich dudes would still invest but there could not be so much competition in investing so they could ask for higher interests    this would mean that the system is rewarding someone more not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction but because there just happens to be shortage of money   does more money imply that more people will invest yes because of inflation they have to invest not to lose actually that 's why governments maintain inflation so that people are forced to invest

the reason that funds and the like are bad is n't because of the leverage ratio it 's because they 're compounded daily and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the long term return i 'd consider providing big fancy equations using pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus but that would be overkill i do n't think i can do here and i do n't know the relevant anyway anyway from the economics theory perspective the ideal leverage ratio is 1x that is unlevered straight investment consider using leverage costs money you know that surely if someone could borrow money at n% and invest at an expected where x > 0 then they would they would borrow all the money they could and buy all the s&p500 they could but when they bought all that s&p500 they 'd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap that would mean the excess return would be smaller eventually you 'd get to a point where the excess return is zero well no empirically we can see that it 's definitely not zero and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds why   because stocks are riskier than bonds the difference in expected return between an index like the s&p500 and a us treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the s&p500 which is n't guaranteed by the us government to return your principal any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk now assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you like insurance companies and billionaires so the market is n't exactly short of people willing to take risks and you should n't expect the returns of assuming risk in the general case to be awesome now it 's true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also but that 's not an excuse to go leveraged anyway it 's a reason to hold back in fact regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably should n't be holding a 100 stock portfolio they should be that risk with bonds instead and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time the appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk you have done research and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stock index better than the rest of the stock market does you calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks then you dump your money into the leveraged position in exchange for this the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is if you 're just looking to dump money into broad market in a leveraged fashion you 're doing it wrong there is no free money ed which is not to say there 's not money there 's lots of money but if you go looking for the free kind you wo n't find it and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive edit okay so you do n't like my answer i 'm not surprised i 'm giving you a real answer instead of a make free money answer okay here 's your how to make free money answer assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time you 've invested your money and you do n't get to just jump into and out of the market that 's market timing not leverage so you have to stay invested you 're going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories the s&p500 historically rises over time the average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate so the ideal leverage ratio is infinite of course this is a stupid answer in real life because you ca n't pull that off your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money and you 'll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later ultimately it 's a stupid answer because you 're asking the wrong question you should probably ask a better question when i use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk am i being properly compensated for assuming that risk

oddly enough in the usa there are enough cost and tax savings between buy and hold of a static portfolio and buying into a fund that a few brokerages have sprung up around the concept such as to make it easier for small investors to manage numerous small holdings via fractional shares and no commission window trades a static buy and hold portfolio of stocks can be had for a few dollars per trade   buying into a fund involves various annual and one time fees that are quoted as percentages of the investment   even 1 2 can be a lot especially if it is every year   typically a us mutual fund must send out a 1099 tax form to each investor stating that investors share of the dividends and capital gains for each year the true impact of this is not obvious until you get a tax bill for gains that you did not enjoy which can happen when you buy into a fund late in the year that has realized capital gains   what fund investors sometimes fail to appreciate is that they are taxed both on their own holding period of fund shares and the fund 's capital gains distributions determined by the fund 's holding period of its investments for example if abc tech fund bought google stock several years ago for $ 100/share and sold it for $ in the same year you bought into the abc fund then you will receive a capital gains distribution on your 1099 that will include some dollar amount which is considered your share of that long term profit for tax purposes the amount is not customized for your holding period capital gains are distributed pro rata among all current fund shareholders as of the ex distribution date morningstar tracks this as potential capital gains exposure and so there is a way to check this possibility before investing funds who have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules have been called free rides because those funds if they find some winners will have losers that they can sell simultaneously with the winners to remain tax neutral   see on the lookout for tax traps and free riders morningstar pdf in contrast buying and holding a portfolio does not attract any capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit   a fund often is actively managed   that is experts will alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund to buy or sell particular investments note however that even the experts are required to tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results

so if an out of the money option all time value has a price p say $ 3.00 and there are n days the extrinsic value is n't solely determined by time value as your quote suggests it 's also based on volatility and demand here is a quote from distinguishing between extrinsic time value and extrinsic non time value the time value of an option is entirely predictable time value premium declines at an accelerating rate with most time decay occurring in the last one to two months before expiration this occurs on a predictable curve intrinsic value is also predictable and easily followed it is worth one point for every point the option is in the money for example a call with a strike of 30 has three points of intrinsic value when the current value of the underlying stock is $ 33 per share and a 40 put has two points of intrinsic value when the underlying stock is worth $ 38 the third type of premium extrinsic value increases or decreases when the underlying stock changes and when the distance between current value of stock and strike of the option get closer together as a symptom of volatility extrinsic value may be greater for highly volatile underlying stock and lower for less volatile stocks extrinsic value is the only classification of option premium that is unpredictable the you point out probably had a volatility component affecting value this portion is a factor of expectations or uncertainty so an event expected to conclude prior to expiration but of unknown outcome can cause theta to be higher than p n for example a drug company is being sued and the outcome of a trial will determine whether that company pays out millions or not the extrinsic will be higher than p n prior to the outcome of the trial then drops after   of course the most common situation where this happens is earnings after the announcement it 's not unusual to see a dramatic drop in the extrinsic portion of options this is why sometimes a new option trader gets angry when buying calls prior to earnings when surprise good earnings are announced as hoped the rise is stock price is largely offset by a fall in extrinsic value giving call holders little or no gain as for the reverse situation where theta is lower than p n would expect well you can actually have negative theta meaning the extrinsic portion rises over time this statement is a little confusing because theta is usually described as negative but since you describe it as a positive number negative here means the opposite of what you 'd expect   this is a quote from option volatility pricing keep in mind that they use positive theta to mean the time value increases up over time is it ever possible for an option to have a positive theta such that if nothing changes the option will be worth more tomorrow than it is today when futures options are subject to stock type settlement as they currently are in the united states the carrying cost on a deeply in the money option either a call or a put can under some circumstances be greater than the volatility component if this happens and the option is european no early exercise permitted it will have a theoretical value less than parity less than intrinsic value as expiration approaches the value of the option will slowly rise to parity hence the option will have a positive theta sheldon option volatility pricing advanced trading strategies and techniques kindle locations kindle edition

weird he can call it a fraud yet he can not point to the fraudsters implied by his statement unless he believes his own daughter committed fraud by buying and i imagine at some point selling some bitcoin   this does n't feel like a complete thought overall he likes blockchain as a technology he sees the value of bitcoin to escape oppressive regional monetary policies but he somehow stops of accepting where that train of thought would naturally take him perhaps because the conclusion is completely alien to everything he knows

what if there is only one trading day and the volume is smaller than    the open interest on that one trading day this is assuming there is    no open interest before that day i pulled this from a comment this ca n't happen we have zero open interest on day one on day 2 i buy 10 contracts volume is 10 and now open interest is also 10 tomorrow if i do n't sell open interest starts at 10 and will rise by whatever new contracts are traded    this is an example i removed the stock name this happens to be the expiration the 10 contract traded on the $ 3 strike happen to be mine you can see how open interest is cumulative representing all outstanding contracts it 's obvious to me the shares traded as high as $ 5 at some point which created the interest i.e. the desire to trade this strike most activity tends to occur near the current price

i would not expect any problems your interest will have tax deducted at 20 which i do n't think you would be entitled to reclaim because you do n't get a personal allowance if you are n't resident in the uk and unless you have a huge amount of uk earnings you would not be legally liable to any higher rates of tax so there would be no issues there if you were liable to more tax you would be obliged to inform the inland revenue

got job at top 10 bank out of college   first year as analyst i also got involved in college recruiting   there were many discussions on what schools to recruit from   seemed to be a combo of best reputations highest rankings and schools some senior executives went too   our bank had dedicated recruitment at about 10 to 15 schools   if you got into the analyst program outside of that it was through some connection   if memory serves me these were the colleges we recruited from   harvard yale mit dartmouth brown cornell princeton columbia duke nyu stanford ucla cal   think nyu the easiest school that gets dedicated recruiters due to it 's size and location   my bank had more west coast and southern focus than other banks   i believe northwestern and u of chicago get recruited from banks with large chicago offices

in addition to evaluating the business great answer consider the potential payoff if bonds pay off in the 5 10 range the s&p500 has 10.5 you should be expecting a payoff of 15 20 to invest in something riskier than the stock market   that means that if you invest $ 10k then in 5 years you 'll need to get out $ 25 k 20 returns over 5 years    if you get less than this much in 5 years the risk to reward ratio probably rules this out as a good investment

paypal is free for buyers taking their profit from the sellers in much the same way that credit cards take a percentage from the seller though they will also charge you interest if you do n't pay off the entire balance every month as far as i know there 's nothing that keeps a vendor from having a different price for paypal customers than cash customers but that would show up in the number displayed by paypal before you authorize the purchase so if you 're paying attention it should n't be possible to sneak it by you paypal has several modes of operation i 'm not aware of one where they hold your balance normally you either give them your credit card info or you give them information about one of your bank account(s and authorize them to do electronic funds transfer from and to that account on your behalf i 've always stuck with the credit card approach i trust paypal but i do n't trust them that far on principle if i was going to link them to an account it would be a small account i 'd create for that purpose not my main savings checking accounts hm actually i do have one account which normally floats around $ 500 it 's the one i dump accumulated pocket change into and i could use that if i ever feel a need to do so paypal does reduce the risk of credit card numbers being abused by reducing how many people you 've given the number to depending on what kinds of purchases you make that may be a security advantage it certainly does n't hurt personally i have no problem with giving my card number directly to a serious business but on ebay or sites of that sort where i 'm dealing with individuals who are complete strangers i do like the isolation that paypal provides in other words ebay is exactly the environment where i do use paypal after all that 's exactly what paypal was created for

years before retirement is n't related at all to the pretax ira roth ira decision except as income typically trends up over time for most people   if tax rates were constant both at income levels and over time roth and pretax would be identical   say you designate 100k for contribution 20 tax rate   80k contributed in roth vs. 100k contributed in pretax then 20 tax rate on withdrawal ends up with the same amount in your bank account after withdrawal you 're just moving the 20 tax grab from one time to another    if you choose roth it 's either because you like some of the flexibility like taking out contributions after 5 years or because you are currently paying a lower marginal rate than you expect you will be in the future either because you are n't making all that much this year or because you are expecting rates to rise due to political changes in our society   best is likely a diversified approach some of your money pretax some   at least some should be in a pretax ira because you get some tax free money each year thanks to the personal exemption   if you 're working off of 100 post tax you are paying more tax than you ought unless you 're getting enough social security to cover the whole 0 bucket and probably the 10 bucket also so for example you 're thinking you want 70k a year   assuming single and ignoring social security as it 's a very complicated issue joe taxpayer has a nice blog article regarding it that he links to in his answer you get $ 10k or so tax free then another $ 9k or so at 10 almost certainly lower than what you pay now   so you could aim to get $ 19k out of your pre tax ira then and out of your post tax ira meaning you only pay $ 900 in taxes on your income   of course if you 're in the 25 bucket now you may want to use more pretax since you could then take that out all the way to around $ 50k standard exemption + $ 40k or so point where 25 hits   but on the other hand social security would probably change that equation back to using primarily roth if you 're getting a decent social security check

if you were making that large of a payment via a cashiers check or other    withdrawal means from a cash account    to a credit card would the payment    generate a cash transaction report probably yes if it does require the bank to make a ctr then is there any harm in    that or anything to be concerned about    like that transaction appearing    suspicious personal reporting    implications etc are there any    other reasons why one might want to    make sure payments to a credit card    are broken up made in amounts smaller    than $ 10 k you should be concerned if you can not explain the source of the money legally if you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal and you 're done the point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash usually people pay credit cards with checks or ach transactions but if you want cash it 's your right as long as the cash was obtained legally but if you 're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets then you should be worried by the way breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies the report is per transaction not per payment so if the credit card statement is $ 11 k and you pay $ 5 k and $ 6 k the transaction is still $ 11k. also the bank can file a report even if it is not required it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you 're referring to if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious this leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks common sense and internal policies which you do n't know so even paying $ 10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing

having dealt with with social security state agencies and banks more than i 'd care to i would urge you to do the following 1 get a 100 clear answer on whether or not you are listed as joint or authorized user signer for an account this will probably require a call to the bank but for less than an hour of you and your friend 's time you will save yourself a whole lot of hassle the difference is like this if you worked at a business that added you as an authorized user for a credit or debit card this would allow you to use the card to buy things but that does n't make the money in the bank yours on the other hand if you are listed as joint this regards ownership and it could become tricky to establish whether its your money or not to any governmental satisfaction 2 you are completely correct in being honest with the agency but that 's not enough if you do n't know what the facts are you ca n't really be honest with them if the form is unclear it 's ok to ask on having a bank account does being listed as an authorized user on someone else 's account count if it is n't my money or bank account but if you are listed as holding the account jointly that changes the question to i am listed as joint on someone else 's checking account but it is n't my money how is that considered to social security it might mean generating an extra form or it might mean you need to have the status on the account changed or they might not care but if you do n't get the facts first they wo n't give you the right answers or help you need and from personal experience it 's a heck of a lot easier to get a straight and clear answer from a bank than it is from a federal government agency have the facts with you when you contact them and you 'll be ok but trust me you do n't want them guessing

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

even if you 're paying a lot of taxes now you 're talking marginal dollars when you look at current contribution and average tax rate when making withdrawals   ie if you currently pay 28 on your last dollar and assuming your contribution is entirely in your marginal rate then you 're paying 28 on all of the roth contributions but probably paying a lower average tax rate due to the lower tax rates on the first many dollars    look at the overall average tax rate of your expected retirement income if you 're expecting to pull out $ 100k a year you 're probably paying less than 20 in average taxes because the first third or so is taxed at a very low rate 0 or 15 assuming things do n't change in our tax code   comparing that to your 28 and you have a net gain of 8 by paying the taxes later nothing to shake a stick at at minimum have enough in your traditional ira to max out the zero tax bucket at least $ 12k   realistically you probably should have enough to max out the 15 bucket as you presumably are well above that bucket now   any roth savings will be more than eliminated by this difference 28 tax now 15 tax later   yes please a diversified combination is usually best for those expecting to have a lot of retirement savings enough in traditional to get at least $ 35k or so a year out say and then enough in roth to keep your comfortable lifestyle after that the one caveat here is in the case when you max out your contribution levels you may gain by using money that is not in your ira to pay the taxes on the conversion   talk to your tax professional or accountant to verify this will be helpful in your particular instance

compounding is just the notion that the current period 's growth or loss becomes the next period 's principal so applied to stocks your beginning value plus growth or loss in value plus any dividends becomes the beginning value for the next period your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them   compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed either by you or to you you have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance the new balance is used to calculate the next period 's interest which again adds to the balance etc obviously it 's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end interest bearing investments like bonds pay simple interest like stock dividends you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect when using a basic calculator tool for stocks you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your interest rate for bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the interest rate factoring in risk you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time believe it or not this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off

i 'm an australian who just got back from a trip to malaysia for two weeks over the new year so this feels a bit like i set up a 28 degrees credit card my first ever because of their low exchange rate and lack of fees on credit card transactions people say it 's the best card for travel and i was ready for it however since malaysia is largely a cash economy especially in the non city areas i found myself mostly just withdrawing money from my credit card and thus getting hit with a cash advance fee $ 4 and instant application of the high interest rate 22 on the money since i was there already and had no other alternatives i made five withdrawals over the two weeks and ended up paying about $ 21 in fees not great but last time i i had a commonwealth bank travel money card not a great idea and if i 'd used that instead on this trip and given up fees for a higher exchange rate i would have been charged an extra $ 60 presumably my commonwealth debit card would have been the same this is n't even including mandatory atm fees if i 've learned anything from this experience and these envelope calculations i 'm doing now it 's these

i 'm not sure you are paying attention to your own comments if you go back up to the first comment to which i reply that comment is you out scandinavia as an example of what is right   that aside when you say a lot of workers you are discounting the scale of migrant work in scandinavia vs just california let alone the whole usa the population of sweden is 9 million people there are over 11 million people living in the us as illegal immigrants let alone the other 37 million legal immigrants living here the us admits roughly 1 million immigrants per year and there are roughly 1.5 million immigrants total living in sweden   and before you use anywhere in the eu as an example for immigration you should take note of the escalating nationalism across every election everywhere in the eu your utopia is n't adjusting well to having a few around   and after all of that almost none of it is relevant to what i was actually talking about which was this fact through geographic happenstance and political coincidence the us has millions of people who literally risk their lives to come work in conditions you as and unacceptable they risk life and limb and family to sneak here to get this work by the millions we as americans do not have the will to totally shut them out and as a result there is a black market for cheap labor when you see these words i bet you think i am justifying something just as much as i think you think you are defending something when you say this is bad here this i am not making a moral judgement i am stating a fact and as long as there is a supply of millions of people willing to work for less than minimum wage there will be a black market for labor paying less than minimum wage   i 've actually erased several closing paragraphs because i am unclear as to the point you even contend to make right now based on your statement that you never singled out scandinavia and then proceeded to talk about scandinavia   i hope you can understand that history geography and politics all influence the situations counties experience uniquely and that wages are a market driven phenomenon these are not moral statements

i still think this tech boom is different the 2000 boom bust was so much based around a fiction namely the infrastructure and logistics the country was not yet set up for streaming services or online retail the main drivers of that boom bust today broadband is ubiquitous there 's a computer in every home and a smartphone in every pocket big data and automation drives vastly more efficient logistics with the only main obstacle still yet to be worked out is ai that will allow companies like uber and tesla to realize their valuations and the main drivers of tech are the so called stocks facebook alphabet amazon apple and netflix as well as other tech like microsoft and cisco what 's the difference between these and say pets.com or these are real companies pets.com went boom to bust in less than a year sold for $ in 1999 u me today 's overvalued stocks have product customers business models and strategies in place and the infrastructure they depend on actually exists

while the politicians delay dealing with the issues of immigration reform surely they could get together on the limits on h1b visas for young educated foreign workers   yes surely they could get together on the limits on h1b visas for young educated foreign workers and thereby throw even more older tech workers out of work as you can see from the first graph and table at the top 11 users of h1b visas in 2013 were companies heavily involved in outsourcing and as you can see from the third graph and table at over 80 percent of initial h-1b hires are under 35   few of those high tech firms pushing to increase or abolish the limits on h1b visas even suggest that we need have any concern for u.s. workers perhaps workers and other citizens should reward those tech companies by giving them a taste of their own philosophy ignore any suggestion that we give any to tech products made in the u.s. and buy only foreign products that will help build the foreign competition giving those foreign workers places closer to home at which they can work that may dry up the supply of cheap foreign labor and cause u.s. companies to treat their u.s. workers a little better and to paraphrase the pro h1b philosophy why should we buy a product made in the u.s. when a more qualified one is available from a foreign country

the question lacks i.e. when does the initial investment occur now or one period from now   if now then it is a perpetuity due    i   will consider under 2 scenarios a and b relating to the size of the initial investment a. assuming that the initial investment occurs now and each payment thereafter has the relationship with this investment then the relevant base equation is that for the present value of a growing perpetuity due expressed in terms of i.e.     g now to suit the question asked we can see that i = fixed rate of return f and g = expected inflation rate e such that we can rewrite the equation as pvgpd = e    we know that f = is a fixed nominal rate and must be adjusted for e to calculate the real rate r according to the equation therefore   pvgpd = up   pvgpd = pvgpd = b. assuming that the initial investment x is not equal to each subsequent perpetual payment then the relevant base equation is that for the the initial investment plus the present value of a growing perpetuity i.e.     x + g   = x + e     substituting pvgpd = x + up   pvgpd = x +

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

in this equation the withdrawal rate is the percent you must pull from your savings to meet your expenses for example if your savings is $ 100,000 and you need $ 10,000 annually for your living expenses then your withdrawal rate would be 10 where 10k is 10 of 100k   to complete this formula you need to know how much savings you need to be financially independent before you can use this formula to find out how long it will take you

this is really unfortunate   in general you ca n't back date individual policies   you could have if it was available to you elected to extend your employer 's coverage via cobra for the month of may and possibly june depending on when your application was submitted then let the individual coverage take over when it became effective    groups have some latitude to retroactively cover and terminate employees but that 's not an option in the world of individual coverage the carriers are very strict about submission deadlines for specific effective dates   this is one of the very few ways that carriers are able to say no within the bounds of the aca   you submit an application you are assigned an effective date based on the date your application was received and subsequently approved   it has nothing to do with how much money you send them or whether or not you told them to back date your application if someone at the new york exchange told you you could have a retroactive effective date they should n't have many providers have financial hardship programs   you should talk to the er hospital and see what might be available to you   the insurer is likely out of the equation though if the dates of service occurred before your policy was effective regarding your 6th paragraph regarding having paid the premium   in this day and age carriers can only say no via administrative means   they set extremely rigid effective dates based on your application date   they will absolutely cancel you if you miss a payment   if you get money to them but it was after the grace period date even by one minute they will not reinstate you   if you 're cancelled you must submit a new application which will create a new coverage gap   you pay a few hundred dollars each month to insure infinity risk you absolutely have to cover your administrative bases because it 's the only way a carrier can say no anymore so they cling to it

how would they make money from it    they sell you the software for $ 100 us example could as easily be 100 euros or 10,000 japanese yen   you use it to make recommendations on your blog   your blog becomes rich from advertising   they sold $ 100 worth of software   if they spent $ 1 million in labor developing it they 're way behind    another problem is that the software would stop working and need adjusted periodically   this is easy to do on a server but annoying on a pc   and who pays for the adjustments    put both those things together and it 's a lot easier to do on a server   another advantage is that a server can get a better data feed as well   pay a premium for the detailed information rather than relying on public sources   and people are used to renting server access where they expect to buy software once    another issue is that they are unlikely to beat the market this way   yes have done so   but that 's the latest ai constantly adjusted   this is going to be a previous generation ai   it 's more likely to match the market   and we already have a way to match the market   an index fund    if someone had a brilliant ai the best use would probably be to sell it to a fund manager   the fund manager could then use the ai to find opportunities for its existing investors   note that a $ 10 billion fund with a 10 return that gives a .1 commission would be paying $ 1 million   and that has no marketing or packaging overhead   think $ 10 billion is a lot   fidelity has $ 2 trillion

interns are not hired to do work they are hired so that people at the company can get a look at their abilities in a real situation not an interview before hiring them for real this way instead of 30 of your new hires being a dud it 's more like 5 because the bad ones were filtered out in the intern process if you are self motivated and good enough then it 's quite possible that you will start getting real work while you 're at the company as opposed to throwaway assignments that nobody cares about once you 're in that position it means they trust you to actually accomplish something and you will be viewed as a hopeful hire assuming you like the company getting into that position is half the value of the internship so i 'd take it as is with one caveat ask them about schedule flexibility ahead of time explicitly for the purpose of making sure your class schedule works if they 're a decent place to work for they will probably grant you that point outright edit one more note if you 've got a favor to burn save it use it if you like the place and need to ask them for an h1b sponsorship or any other kind of immigration assistance

there is little difference between buying shares in your broker 's index fund and shares of their corresponding etf   in many cases the money invested in an etf gets essentially stuffed right into the index fund i believe vanguard does this for example   in either case you will be paying a little bit of tax   in the etf case it will be on the dividends that are paid out   in the index fund case it will additionally be on the capital gains that have been realized within the fund which are very few for an index fund   not a ton in either case   the more important tax consideration is between purchase and sale which is the same in either case i 'd say stick it wherever the lowest fees are

you have a few options none of which are trade off free apply for a credit card and live off of that    here of course you will go into debt and there are minimums to pay   but it will tide you over   in any case you are getting unsecured credit so your rates will probably be very very high   you do n't want to build up a lot of 20 per annum debt an alternative to this would be to go to any bank and ask for an unsecured loan   having no income it will be difficult though not necessarily impossible to secure some funds   when i was in between houses once for example i was able to borrow $ 30,000 in unsecured debt to help me construct my new house just based on my income   grant you i paid it 2 months later in order to avoid the 10 year interest but the point is that unsecured debt does exist   credit cards are easier to get   arrange for personal financing through your parents or other relatives if your parents can send you remittances the terms will most likely be more generous   they know your credit and your true ability to repay   just because they send you money does n't mean you have to live with them   as a parent i have a stake in ensuring my children 's success   if i think that them over briefly is in their best interest and mine you better be sure i 'll do it a variation on this is something like kiva   here if you can write up a story compelling enough to get finance there are people who might lend you money   kiva is normally directed towards poorer countries and but local variations exist update google backed is far more appropriate to this situation than kiva   same general idea but that 's the vendor find freelance contract or light employment your concern about employment is justified you do n't want to be in a position where you are unable to travel to an interview because starbucks or mcdonalds will fire you if you do n't show up for a shift   then again do you really care if mcdonald 's lets you go   as such you need to find income that is less bound by schedule   freelance work in particular will give you that freedom assuming you have a skill you can trade   likewise short term contract work is equally flexible usually   finally it may be easiest just to get temporary pickup work in a service capacity   in any event doing something will be better than doing nothing   who knows you might want to be a manager owner of a mcdonalds some day   would n't hurt to say i started at the bottom

you do n't need your refund to be as small as possible but you usually would want it to be as small as possible the reason people say you should aim for a small refund is that getting a big refund means you paid more in taxes than you had to   this means you gave away money that you could have done something else with   you get the money back later as a tax refund but you lost the ability to use it during the time the government had it for instance if as you say you are getting a $ 1000 tax refund that 's $ 1000 that you are giving to the government over the course of the year   at the end of the year you get it back so you end the year with $ 1000   if you instead kept the money by paying only exactly as much tax as you owe throughout the year you could invest it somehow so that by the end of the year it could potentially have grown to say $ 1050   thus at the end of the year you would have $ 1050 instead of $ 1000 ideally you would have zero refund and owe zero extra at the end of the year   however since it is often difficult to make things work out so exactly people often say you should aim for a small refund assuming you are in the usa if your income is only $ 9000 you will likely not owe any federal income tax at all so you could claim exemption from withholding and avoid paying any tax ahead of time   you could check this when you file your taxes by seeing if the refund you get is equal to the total of taxes withheld from your paychecks over the course of last year

because its going to effect a lot of people 's jobs but being able to work deals with those jobs on the table is essential to us business export interests in the rapidly growing developing countries which have a surplus of skilled workers who could do those jobs    without privatizing education they could not put those hundreds of thousands of jobs into play   the same thing goes for health care which i ve heard described repeatedly in terms like the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal economy a dangerous situation because they mean exactly what it sounds like    they could not be giving discounts to americans or having public health care here its too important to the us insurance and drug industries that us trade goals be maintained purely and consistently

according to your numbers you just stated that you spend approximately $ 1500 in discretionary expenditures per month yet are unable to save i fully realize that living in a big city is usually expensive but on your presumably after tax salary i think you can easily save a substantial portion of your income as others have already noted enforcing saving of a significant portion of your discretionary income is the most obvious step   it 's easy to say but i suspect that if you are like most people who have difficulty saving the psychological impact of quitting your previous spending habits cold turkey is likely to be very harsh all the more so if you have an active social life   you may find yourself becoming depressed or at having to save   you may lose motivation to work as hard because you might think that you 're putting away all this money for the distant future whereas you are young now and want to enjoy life while you can it is in this context then that i looked at your other financial obligations   paying $ to your parents is a lot   it 's over 20 of your after tax salary   you do not specify the reasons for doing this other than a vague sense of familial duty but my recommendation is to see if this could be reduced somewhat   if you can bring it down to $ 1000/month that $ 300 would go into your savings and you would psychologically feel a lot better about putting say $ 600 of your own discretionary income into savings as well   now you have all told about $ 1000/month of savings without severely your extra expenditures but i would start with that $ 1500/month of luxury spending first   and yes you do need to view it as luxury spending   the proper frame of mind is to compare your financial situation to someone who is truly unable to save because their entire income is spent on actual necessities   food and shelter their effective tax rate is 0 because they earn too little and they usually find themselves in debt because they can not make ends meet   now look back at that $ 1500/month   can you honestly say that you can not afford to cut that spending

not really   they did n't account for the fact that the income would first be spread out over 8 billion people   i do n't know if anyone in keynes time was thinking about dozens of industries closed in america and moved directly to china   had you suggested that to them i think they would have thought it ridiculous but that is in fact what happened   also theories on trade suggest that it makes everyone better off   so if you ask any economist at any given point if more free trade is better they will probably say yes   that was all fine until about the 1980s when computer networks made it possible to supply chains   suddenly vast cad cam systems sprung up and suddenly you could pay a worker a $ 1 a day to do what someone in the us was getting $ 45 an hour to do   the economics of it for corporations were absolutely and they lobbied hard to make sure noting got in the way note that free trade passed under both parties   in order to mask the fact that this was happening a giant credit bubble was created in the developed world using the newfound savings of the developing world   living standards were temporarily maintained in developed countries by borrowing money from the people they had sent their jobs to   the effects of this are all pretty clear   most developed nations are now burdened under a mountain of debt   central banks are having a difficult time maintaining enough liquidity to support the illusion of buying power in developed nations that is no longer present without enormous artificial support   many americans alive today can not even remember a time when america 's current account deficit was not deeply in the red   so far the only thing propping up developed nations is the use and threat of use of vastly superior military force   that has n't really changed but every day the developing nations a little bit more on the resources of the world for consumption rather than just production   as that happens the out of the developed world start to feel more and more pressured as they come to realize they really do n't have much of value to trade   america 's biggest exports are food and services   food is surely important but one farmer can farm like 100,000 acres   and services just means we can export the time of a wall street douchebag at a high rate of pay

if this is your friend and he that convinced he will get rich from this then there 's really nothing you can do   you 've obviously done your best to explain the situation to him but he 's been caught up in their sales pitch and that 's more convincing to him i worked in sales for many years and the answers he gives you the one about not needing to know the details of how your smartphone works is a classic variation of typical objection handling that salespeople are taught proves that he has been sucked in by their scheme at this stage all you 're going to do is ruin your friendship with him if you continue to press the matter because he has made it clear he ca n't be convinced that this is anything other than legitimate   the reality is he is probably in too deep at this stage to just walk away from it so he has to convince himself that he made a wise choice schemes like this use a scarcity approach there 's only so much to go around and if you do n't get yours now then someone else will get it coupled with ego boosting boy mr. prospect this is such a great opportunity and you 're one of only a few who are sophisticated enough to understand and take advantage of it to get people to lower their guard and not ask a whole lot of probing questions nobody wants to feel stupid and they do n't want others to think they 're stupid so these schemes will present the information in such a way that ordinarily prudent questions come across as sounding dumb making the questioner seem not so smart   rather than walking away from it peoples pride will sometimes make them double down on it and they 'll just go along with it to come across as though they get it even when they really do n't the small payouts at early stages are a classic sign of a ponzi scheme   your friend will never listen to you as long as those little checks continue to come in because to him they 're absolute proof he 's right and you 're wrong   it 's those checks or payouts however they 're doing it that will make him step up his efforts to recruit other people into the scheme or worse yet invest more of his own money into this keep in mind that in the end you really have no power to do anything in this situation other than be his friend and try to use gentle persuasion   he 's already made it clear that he is n't going to listen to your explanations about why this is a scam for a couple reasons   first and probably greatest it would be an admission that he 's dumb or at least not as smart as you and who wants that   second he continues to get little checks that reinforce the fact this must be real or why else would he be getting this money   third he has already demonstrated his commitment to this by quitting his job so from his point of view this has become an all or nothing ticket to wealth    the bottom line is these schemes work because the sales pitch is powerful enough to overcome ordinary logic for people who think there just has to be an easy way to easy street all you can do is just be there as his friend and hope that he sees the light before the damage to himself and anyone else gets too great   you ca n't stop him from what he 's doing any more than you can stop the sun from rising as long the message and checks he 's getting from other people keep him convinced he 's on the right path edit after reading the comments posted in this thread i do want to amend my statements because many good points have been raised here   you obviously ca n't just sit by and do nothing while your friend talks others into taking the same or worse risks that he is   that 's not morally right by any measure at the same time however be very careful about how you go about this   your friend as you stated sounds pretty much like he 's all in with this scheme so there 's definitely going to be some serious emotional commitment to it on his part as well   anyone and everything that threatens what he sees as his ticket to easy street could easily become a target when this all comes crashing down as it inevitably will   you could very well be the cause of that in his eyes especially if he knows you 've been discouraging people from buying into this nightmare people are not rational creatures when it comes to money losses   it 's called costs where they 'll continue to chase their losses on the rationale they 'll make up for it if they just do n't give up   the more your friend committed to this the worse his about losing so he 'll do whatever he has to in order to save his position   this is what gamblers do and why the house does so well for itself some have suggested making anonymous flyers or other means of communicating that do n't expose you as the person spreading the message and that 's one suggestion   however the problem with this is that since the receiver has no idea who sent the message they 're not likely to give it the kind of credibility or notice that they would to something passed to them by a person they know and trust and your anonymous message will have little weight in the face of the persuasive pitch that got your friend to commit his own money and future another problem as you 've noted is that you do n't travel in the same circles as the people he 's likely to recruit so how would you go about warning them   how would they view their first contact with you when it comes with a message not to trust what someone else they already know is about to tell them   would they write it off as someone who 's   hard to tell another huge ploy of these schemes is that they tend to preemptively strike at what you propose doing that is warning people to stay away   they do this by projecting the people giving the warnings as losers who did n't see the opportunity for themselves and now want to keep others away from their own financial success   they 'll portray you as someone who is n't smart enough to see this huge opportunity and since you ca n't understand it you do n't think anyone else does either   they 'll point out that if you were so good with finances why are n't you already successful these guys are very good and they have an answer for every objection you can raise whether its to them or to someone else   they 've spent a long time honing their message which makes it difficult for anyone to say something persuasive enough to sway others away from being duped   this is a hard path no doubt i hope you are able to warn others away   just be aware that it may come at a cost to you as well and be prepared for what that might be i hope this helps good luck

this is mostly an addendum to answer which appears to list reasonable causes but ignores the technical cost aspect the other answer lists the technical cause but does n't explain it in detail look at the two graphs from wikipedia this is how difficult in terms of computing power meaning hardware costs and electricity costs it has been to mine bitcoins over years   this is how many total bitcoins have been made since the start of btc era   as you can see despite rising difficulty and costs the bitcoin mining is slowing down it should be noted that this is by design if you could use a home computer at start of bitcoin and mine 1 bitcoin a day on it nowadays you need to use specialized hardware costing thousands of dollars and pay huge sums in electricity costs in order to mine the same 1 bitcoin in a day and this happened on the large scale quite recently   add the fact that there is no visible way to significantly increase bitcoin mining speed regardless of hardware used the network self adapts   the more hardware anyone throws at it the harder it becomes for him and everyone else so extra hardware is used in order to drive out smaller players and keep the general ability to mine rather than to increase the mining speed last year a friend and i were considering buying a couple specialized rigs running on off the shelf powerful computers and using extra gaming graphics cards for number crunching as we did n't get on the train fast enough the graphic cards were bought up by bitcoin mining organizations en masse

in gambling the house also takes a cut so the total money in the game is shrinking by 2 10 percent   so if you gain $ 100 it 's because other people lost $ 105 and you do this for dozens of plays so it up   the market owns companies who are trying to create economic value take nothing and make it something they usually succeed and this adds to the total pot and makes all players richer regardless of trades    gambling is transactional there 's a pull or a roll or a hand and when it 's over you must do new transactions to continue playing    investing parks your money indefinitely you can be 30 years in a stock and that 's one transaction and given the long time virtually all your gains will be new economic value created at no one else 's expense i.e. nobody loses   now it 's possible to trade in and out of stocks very rapidly causing them   to be transactional like gambling the extreme example is day trading   when you 're not in a stock long enough for the company to create any value paid in dividends or the market appreciating the value then yes for someone to gain someone else must lose and the house takes a cut e.g. etrade 's $ 10 trading fee in and out   in that case both players are trying to win and one just had better info on average    another case is when the market drops for instance right after brexit i dumped half my domestic stocks and bought euro index funds i gambled euro stocks would rebound better than us stocks would continue to perform   obviously others were that american stocks will still grow more than euro will rebound   who won that gamble   certainly we will all do better long term but some of us will do better er and that 's what it 's all about

yes bond funds are marked to market so they will decline as the composition of their holdings will households actually have relative levels of credit to equity holdings   the reason why is because there is little return on credit making it irrational to hold any amount greater than to fund future liquidity needs risk adjusted and time discounted the vast majority of credit is held by insurance companies   pension funds have large stakes as well   banks hold even fewer bonds since they try to sell them as soon as they 've made them insurance companies are forced to hold a large percentage of their floats in credit then preferred equity   while this their returns it 's not a large problem for them because they typically hold bonds until maturity   only the ones who the risk of insurance will have to sell at unfavorable prices being able to predict interest rates thus bond prices accurately would make one the best bond manager in the world   while it does look like inflation will rise again soon just as it has during every other us expansion can it be assured when commodity prices are high in real terms and look like they may be in a collapse   the banking industry would have to produce credit at a much higher rate to counter the deflation of all physical goods households typically shun assets at low prices to pursue others at high prices so their holdings of bonds etfs should be expected to decline during a bond collapse   if insurance companies find it less costly to hold etfs then they will contribute to an increase in bond etf supply

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

you owe $ 20,000 to a 1 per week interest   i 'm happy to get 1 per month and trust you to pay it back so i lend you the $ 20,000   the first lender got his money and now you are paying less interest as you pay the loan back this is how a refi works only the first bank wo n't try to break the legs of the second bank for moving into their business   this line reinvested the money into the mortgage to lower his monthly payments implies he also paid it down a bit the new mortgage is less principal than the one before

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

most banks offer prepaid cards nowadays that should fit the bill here i would recommend first checking with your bank to see what they offer as that 's probably the easiest and perhaps cheapest option my bank for example has an entirely fee free prepaid card that while marketed towards teens is entirely applicable for this case   other banks seem to offer similar products some of them have more or less fees but almost all that i 've seen are better than the commercial products you 'd find in a grocery store    as an example and i do n't know anything about it so i do n't specifically recommend this just what i mean note that the fees vary some should be able to be used without ever incurring fees and some have fees you wo n't avoid   most seem to have the concept of sponsor or it you are the cardholder your dad would be the companion cardholder but in either way it means you can load money and generally would be the sole money and your dad could then spend it if your bank does n't offer what you want you may want to consider getting an account with a provider that offers what you 're looking for so to make deposits easier   most of these allow deposits from other sources than checking accounts with that bank but in many cases you may incur a fee or take longer for the money to clear

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

disclaimer i am not an accountant nor a tax pro etc etc yes a canadian corporation can function as a partial income tax shelter   this is possible since a corporation can retain earnings profits indefinitely and corporate income tax rates are generally less than personal income tax rates   details if you own and run your business through a corporation you can choose to take income from your corporation in one of two ways   as salary or as dividends salary constitutes an expense of the corporation i.e. it gets deducted from revenue in calculating corporate taxable income   no corporate income tax is due on money paid out as salary   however personal income taxes and other deductions e.g. cpp would apply to salary at regular rates the same as for a regular employee dividends are paid by the corporation to shareholders out of after tax profits   i.e. the corporation first pays income tax on taxable income for the fiscal year and resulting net income could be used to pay dividends or not at the personal level dividends are taxed less than salary to account for tax the corporation paid   the net effect of corporate + personal tax is about the same as for salary leaving out deductions like cpp the key point dividends do n't have to be paid out in the year the money was earned   the corporation can carry profits forward retained earnings as long as it wants and choose to issue dividends or not in later years given that here 's how would the partial income tax shelter works at some point for you to personally realize income from the corporation you can have the corporation declare a dividend you 'll then have to pay personal income taxes on the income at the dividend rates   but for as long as the money was invested inside the corporation it was subject only to lesser corporate tax rates not higher personal income tax rates   hence the partial aspect of this kind of tax shelter or if you 're lucky enough to find a buyer for your corporation you could qualify for the lifetime capital gains exemption on proceeds up to $ 750,000 when you sell a qualified small business corporation   this is the best exit strategy unfortunately not an easy one where the business has no valuable assets e.g. a client base or intellectual property the major sticking point   you need to have real business revenue   a regular employee of another company ca n't funnel his personally earned employment income into a corporation just to take advantage of this mechanism   sorry

gt   shitty no doubt   i doubt it in fact i think it 's quite reasonable   exceptions and loopholes are n't in the tax code by accident they were put there deliberately so certain people would n't have to pay their taxes   dodging taxes legally is following the rules   period     have you ever given part of your paycheck back to your employer because you feel like you did n't work hard enough to earn it or that you 'd rather contribute to the company succeeding   fuck   we 're buying israel weapons to bomb hospitals and flooding the military with weapons and tanks they do n't need then giving those to our cops so they can run us over and shoot us with them   then there 's the pa commission here do n't even get me started   we 're paying the nsa to listen to and watch everything we do and pumping all that info back to israel and others   and i 'm supposed to somehow voluntarily pay more for these things     the only thing shitty here is the tax code to begin with the winners are the slimy politicians the ultra rich and conglomerate corps the losers are small businesses and the middle class both of whom do n't have the cash base to pay for legal services to reap such tax benefits   ya know the same people all the politicians circlejerk about protecting and helping to thrive hanging them out to dry   taxes too high is a minor problem not enough people paying them is a bigger one but wasting them is worse than either of the two combined

buying a put is hedging   you wo n't lose as much if the market goes down but you 'll still lose capital lower value of your long positions buying an like is safer than shorting a stock because you do n't have the unlimited losses you could have when you short a stock   it is volatile   it 's not a whole lot different than buying a put it uses futures and swaps to give the opposing behavior to the underlying index   some places indicate that the tax consequences could be severe   it is also a hedge if you do n't sell your long positions   opposes the nasdaq 100 which is tech heavy so bear that in mind selling your long positions gets you out of equities completely   you 'll be responsible for taxes on capital gains   it gets your money off of the table as opposed to playing side bets or buying insurance   sorry for the gambling analogy but that 's a bit how i feel with stock indices now

let ’s try the more straightforward approach again   the current state of economics does n’t take into consideration the human condition   as you have done yourself it refuses to even admit that the human condition should be a factor it considers   but when humans are in dire we find their economic position is directly against their human condition   which of these two will win   hint not the current economic system unless it starts accounting for and being tolerant of the human condition   how could i possibly know that   humans created the economic system   it is not an innate part of their condition contrary to what many would suggest   when faced with two opposing forces humans will almost always destroy the weaker of the two to end the conflict   humans can not destroy the human condition   feelings do have an impact on the economy   trust and loyalty love and hate all impact it   when we let the economy lead to suffering we design its own downfall   if the economic system could instead be seen as only a trade structure that backs off when other influences come to bear it could survive   but the current capitalist structure tries to place money above all else   so of course it is seeing problems

changes in implied volatility are caused by many things of course and it is tough to isolate the effect you are describing but let 's try to generalize for a moment implied volatility is generally a measure of how much expect uncertainty there is about the future price of the stock   uncertainty generally is higher in periods including earnings announcements because it is significant new information about the company 's fortunes can make for significant changes in the price however you could easily have the case where the earnings are good and for some reason the market is very certain that the earnings will be good and near a certain level   in that case the price would rise but the implied volatility could well be lower because the market believes that there will be no significant new information in the earnings announcement

if you start an llc with you as the sole member it will be considered a disregarded entity   this basically means that you have the protection of being a company but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation   now here is the good stuff   if you file form you can change your sole member llc to file as an s corp.   once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes   you will need to employ yourself and give a reasonable salary   this will be reported to the irs and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation now as the sole member you can then pay yourself distribution to share holders from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax check with your tax guy and make sure to document correctly   the other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar irs tax year   this means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you do n't bump yourself into another tax bracket   example   you cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution   if you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket   if your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check

generally speaking i find that jumping jobs either in company or outside it is sometimes required for even advancing in title    when i was working at a in the portland metro area people jumped around a lot i 'd say between a 1 1/2 years and 2 years was the average time someone stayed in a position before either moving around moving out to another company or maybe finally moving up    lets say you were a financial analyst and you wanted to be a senior financial analyst generally speaking you would need 4 5 years   in to get there organically within the same org if ever    the reality is for every single one of those senior financial analyst positions there is probably 100 200 applicants including inside and outside applicants while being an employee there was definitely a good thing it does n't guarantee you jack or shit you might have worked at for 3 years but some guy coming from silicon valley who is moving up north to oregon so he can afford a house is probably going to beat you in the interview process    so that 's when the other options come in you can move around and get a new position a new title and the new experiences and connections that come with it or you jump ship to a senior financial analyst position somewhere else the fact of the matter is applying for jobs is a giant crap shoot if you work in something that is unrelated to engineering product creation etc where your work can speak for you if you have the word analyst or associate in your title then career branding means more than anything else which job hopping gets you   companies already expect you to leave for better opportunities all the reasons to be loyal are dead if you are n't waiting for stock options to vest there are no more pensions raises are minimal if you get them at all and if you become a burden on the wage expense line of the p&amp;l they will drop you without a second thought and maybe a severance   get yours and remember that a job is a job and that no matter how much they tell you otherwise you are replaceable and when your employer looks at you they do n't see value they see a business expense

this may be a controversial opinion but i think this makes great business sense   they found that the cost of running two battery production lines 60 amp 75 exceeded the cost of providing the slightly more expensive battery for every s60 customer   they also gain the benefit of enriching the resale market and providing customer choice   i do n't think that most people here realize that software locking functionality is a very common practice across manufacturers and industries to reduce manufacturing costs and provide customer options   what is rare is the ability to unlock after purchase   for example my last vw was a golf and it shared the same with several other vw lines including more expensive offerings with more premium features   one of these premium features is a package that enables you to roll your windows up and down from your key by holding the unlock or lock button but my car did not come with that option in fact no golf at the time came with it   the package was not enabled but the software and hardware was there   you can grab yourself a usb cable and software and go enable it yourself and a number of other nice features   all of this said i think we are in the early days of dlc   remember when you could by a full game for $ 50 and play it for a year and then some dlc would come out and give you reason to play again for $ 5 or $ 10   then companies cough ea cough came along and started to make the dlc part of what you needed to have the full experience on day 1   yea that is bad   i am in support of what tesla has done so far but the second they or possibly another manufacturer looking to capitalize on the idea of dlc starts removing standard bits to make them post facto we may be getting into a bad place

first of all you 'll need a securities account nowadays most large banks offer this as a standard product for all their customers though it may require some extra paperwork then you need to buy shares in the etf this is indeed typically done through the stock market but there are alternatives some banks will sell securities to you directly but usually only those they create themselves options and such some also offer etf investment plans that allow you to buy shares for a fixed amount each month through the bank in any case the bank 's online banking interface should support all these options however fees are an important consideration with some banks the securities account is free others charge an annual fee and the fees on stock market transactions and investment plans also vary considerably so it could be worth it to consider some alternatives

to understand the twist you need to understand what the yield curve is   you must also understand that the price of debt is inverse to the interest rate so when the price of bonds or notes or bills rises that means the current price goes up and the yield to maturity has gone down   currently early 2012 the short term rate is low close to zero the tools the fed uses setting short term rates for one is exhausted as their current target is basically zero for this debt but my mortgage is based on 10yr rates not 1 yr or 30 day money the next step in the fed 's effort is to try to pull longer term rates down by buying back 10 year notes in this quantity the fed impacts the yield at that point on the curve buying remember supply demand pushes the price up and for debt a higher price equates to lower yield to raise the money to do this they will sell short term debt these two transactions effectively try to twist the curve to pull long term rates lower and push the economy

something that 's come up in comments and been alluded to in answers but not explicit as far as i can tell even if your marginal tax rate now were equal to your marginal tax rate in retirement or even lower a traditional ira may have advantages   that 's because it 's your effective tax rate that matters on withdrawls based on ty 2014 single person but applies at higher numbers for other arrangements you pay 0 taxes on the first $ of income and then pay 10 on the next $ then 15 on $ then 25 on the total amount over that up to $ etc   as such even if your marginal rate is 25 say you earn $ 80k your effective rate is much less for example $ 80k income you pay taxes on $   that ends up being $ for an effective rate in total of let 's say you had the same salary $ 80k from 20 to 65 and for 45 years saved up 10k a year plus earned enough returns to pay you out $ 80k a year in retirement   in a roth you pay 25 on all $ 10k   in a traditional you save that $ 2500 a year because it comes off the top the amount over $ and then pay during retirement your effective tax rate because it 's the amount in total that matters    so for roth you had while for traditional the correct amount is n't but   you make the difference between .75 and back even with the identical income   of course if your $ 10k would take you down a marginal bracket then it also has an effective tax rate of something between the two rates thus roth makes sense if you expect your effective tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now   this is very possible still because for people like me with a mortgage high property taxes two kids and student loans my marginal tax rate is pretty low even with a reasonably nice salary i still pay 15 on the stuff that 's heading into my ira   sadly my employer has only a traditional 401k but they also contribute to it without requiring a match so i wo n't complain too much   since i expect my eventual tax rate to be in that 18 20 at a minimum i 'd benefit from a roth ira right now this matters more for people in the middle brackets earning high 5 figure salaries as individuals or low 6 figure as a couple because the big difference is relevant when a large percentage of your income is in the 15 and below brackets   if you 're earning $ 200k then so much of your income is taxed at 28 33 it does n't make nearly as much of a difference and odds are you can play various tricks when you 're retiring to avoid having as high of a tax rate

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible not cheapest at the lowest price with the highest benefit   the cost relative to the benefit is very cheap and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance for instance   it is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance in theory you want to buy enough disability to replace 100 of your after tax income or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies   insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80 or so    keep in mind that you will need to continue to save invest if you are on long term disability since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for social security   in addition your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures possibly needing cobra private health insurance etc

the 20x number is drawn directly from the assumption that it should be easy to get more than 4 average return on investment after lots of historical studies   monte carlo simulations and the like there was a consensus that saving more did n't significantly increase the odds of achieving at least the desired yearly income sustainably that 's the same calculations the insurance firms use as the starting point for writing annuities there are also some assumptions about inflation and its interaction with the market built into this rule of thumb note that this is 20x what you want as post retirement income not necessarily 20x your current income i have a moderately frugal lifestyle and my budget confirms that my actual spending even in years when i allow myself a splurge is well below my current income with the excess going into the investments to sustain my lifestyle i need that lower number plus any taxes that 'll be due on it plus whatever i want to allocate as average emergency reserve and theoretically i should be able to base the 20x on that lower number when i run estimates quicken has a tool for this so does my credit union i   presume others are widely available they tend to confirm this i 'm still using the higher number for planning though i do n't feel any need to retire early though i have issues with my current manager and i have no objection at all to being able to afford better toys on occasion or to leaving a legacy to friends relatives and/or charity but it 's nice to know exactly when i could the day job if i wanted to

the solution is x = this assumes that chuck 's six years of deposits start from today so that the first deposit accumulates 10 years of gain i.e. +   the second deposit gains nine years interest + and so on     if you want to do this calculation using the formula for an annuity due i.e.   where   formula by induction you have to bear in mind this is for the whole time span k = 1 to n so for just the first six years you need to calculate for all ten years then subtract another annuity calculation for the last four years   so the full calculation is   as you can see it 's not very neat because the standard formula is for a whole time span   you could make it a little by using a formula for k = m to n instead i.e.   so the calculation becomes   which can be done with simple arithmetic and does n't actually need a solver

gt sessions has literally said i thought those kkk guys were fine until i found out they smoked pot   he may well be a racist but it 's hard to imagine taking that comment seriously   barry and albert glenn attorneys at the justice department testified that they heard sessions make the kkk comment but had considered it a joke even sessions ’s comment to other people as a story in a humorous vein he said when working on a case such as this one a brutal murder and a hanging those that work on it sometimes do resort to operating room humor and that is what i considered it to be at the time   later in the hearings sessions said figures ’s assertion that sessions seriously made the comment is ludicrous i had just learned that the investigation had revealed that the had left some meeting and gone to another one and smoked pot the comment the i the   there do seem to be a considerable number of claims that he has said or acted in racist ways though though he denies it previous quote from that source also

its much less likely for that to happen now as it was 20 or 30 years ago   see the link i just p the positions of europe and the us have to some degree reversed looking at the bright side for wealthy people the us is a good place for wealthy people to live because the chance of them getting poorer than their parents is substantially lower than in other countries    on the other hand if you are poor you have a better chance of moving to a higher income bracket in most western european countries than you do in the us of course as recently as the 80s the situation was reversed and it could easily reverse again    the statistics in the us are much better if you are an immigrant for some reason this income does n't seem to hold as true for immigrant families as it does for american families that have been here for several generations

i concur with pretty much what everyone else said let me break it down in a concrete plan of action   first though note that at least the minimum payments for the credit cards needs to be on this list of fixed expenses also you have $ remaining in a normal month food could be $ 500 or more easily for a family so find out how much   adding in just those 2 things and you 're already at your max and there are other expenses in life    ok cutting from the top gone pure luxury and between netflix hulu and your    internet connection hook your computer to the tv there 's no need    for it $ 80 savings   cell phones you 're already moving in the right direction but not    far enough in a financial crunch why does your stay at home wife have    a cell especially when she could just as easily use google voice for    free both plans gone replaced by one of the $ 105    savings total $ savings   529 plans of course you want to save for your kids college but it    does n't help them for you to drown financially gone until your credit    card debit is too $ 50 savings $ total ok we 're already up to $ in savings just cutting items you do n't need that probably gets you back into the black but why stop there   trimming expenses   electric ok i know it 's summer but can you cut this back is the    thermostat set as high as you can comfortably bear are you diligent    in turning of lights especially incandescent do you turn off your    computer when you 're not using it see if you can get the electric    down by 10 that 's $ savings does n't seem like much but it    adds up   gas same with gas do you have gas hot water if so cut shower    length saves on water too   food this one you did n't list but as i said you could be spending    $ 500 or $ 600 a month easily for a family do you guys plan meals and    thus plan shopping trips if not do it you 'll be surprised how much    you can save either way 10 reduction should be doable that 's    $ 50/month if you do n't plan now 20 is within reach that 's    $ 100/month ok that may have added as much as $ 130 or so if so you 're now up to $ savings that 's like a 15 raise   simply cutting however is only half the plan you want to improve your situation so you can get the back assuming you 'll even want it at that point and the wife 's cell phone for starters   to do that you 've got to nail down that debt i figure you 've got minimum $ in debt payments that 's not including your mortgage and including an assumed $ minimum credit card payments you pay over 21 of your take home to short term and consumer debt   yea that 's why you 're hurting here 's what you do   in both cases apply the extra payments entirely to one balance at a    time pick either the smallest balance psychologically best because    you quickly see a loan it 's payment or the highest    interest mathematically the best roll each regular payment that 's paid off into the extra debt payments you did n't list total debt balances but you did say you had $ 4000 in    credit card debt applying an extra $ to debt out of that    $ savings plus two extra paychecks of $ 1300 each is $    paid off in under a year you could have those credit cards paid off and likely that window loan too start the 529s again but keep going    paying down the rest when you have the car paid off bring back the    wife 's cell you and i both know that 's going to be 1 on the list     then finish off those student loans   then in the extra $ 21 of your income you 'll have in sweet sweet green cash

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

there 's a concept in retail called a loss leader and essentially it means that a store will sell an item intentionally at a loss as a way of bringing in business in the hope that while consumers are in the store taking advantage of the discounted item they 'll make other purchases to make up for the loss and generate an overall profit many times it only makes sense to carry items that enhance the value of something else the store sells   stores pay big money to study consumer behaviors and preferences in order to understand what items are natural fits for each other and the best ways to market them    a good example of what you 're talking about is the fact that many grocery stores carry private label products that sell for higher margins and they 'll stock them alongside the name brands that cost much more   as a consequence and since consumers often do n't see a qualitative difference between store brands and name brands much of the time to rationalize spending more the store 's own brands sell better i hope this helps good luck

financial statements provide a large amount of specialized complex information about the company if you know how to process the statements and can place the info they provide in context with other significant information you have about the market then you will likely be able to make better decisions about the company if you do n't know how to process them you 're much more likely to obtain incomplete or misleading information and end up making worse decisions than you would have before you started reading you might for example figure out that the company is gaining significant debt but might be missing significant information about new regulations which caused a one time larger than normal tax payment for all companies in the industry you 're investing in matching the debt increase or you might see a large litigation related spending without knowing that it 's lower than usual for the industry it 's a chicken and egg problem if you know how to process them and how to use the information then you already have the answer to your question i 'd say the more important question to ask is do i have the time and resources necessary to learn enough about how businesses run and about the market i 'm investing in so that financial statements become useful to me if you do have the time and resources do it it 's worth the trouble i 'd advise in starting at the industry business end of things though and only switching to obtaining information from the financial statements once you already have a good idea what you 'll be using it for

option prices consist of two parts the intrinsic value the difference between the strike and the current price of the stock and a time premium representing the probability that the stock will end up above the strike for a call or below for a put    all else being equal options decline in value as time passes since there is less uncertainty about the expected value of the stock at expiration and thus the time premium is smaller   theta is the measure of the change in value in one day   so for every day that passes the calls you sold are going down by $ which is positive to you since you sold them at a higher value and the calls you sold are going down by $ so your position a short spread is gaining $ each day assuming no change in stock price or volatility in reality the stock price and volatility also change every day and those are much stronger drivers of the value of your options   in your case however the options are deep out of the money meaning it 's very likely that they 'll expire worthless so all you have left is time premium which is decaying as time goes on

the two answers given previously provide excellent information in relation to your statement if i buy the above future contract does that mean i pay $ on june 13th you can not buy the futures contract at that price the price you are seeing quoted is not a dollar value but rather a value in points each contract has a point value and this varies from one contract to another according to the specifications set out by the exchange the point value is in dollars and it therefore acts as a multiplier for the price that you 've seen quoted let 's look at an example for the e mini s&p futures these trade electronically on the globex exchange the ecn order book of the cme and carry the ticker symbol es   the es contract has a point value of $ 50 if the quoted price for the es is then its dollar value is 50 x = $ so in order to buy this contract outright with absolutely no use of leverage then one theoretically requires $ in one 's account in practice though futures are traded on margin and so only a deposit amount is required at the time of purchase as cqm has explained

scottish banknotes are notes of the banks issuing them their value will be paid in uk legal tender any time as long as the issuing bank is in business so they are not going to lose value unless the issuing bank goes scottish notes may be refused outside of scotland at least by merchants at their discretion so if the vote goes the wrong way merchants in england may refuse accepting these notes even if just to make a point english notes those issued by the bank of england are the actual uk legal tender wether you should change or not is up to you i believe there 's no danger of them becoming worthless any time soon

regardless of the reason the models are now outside of their own 95 probability range there may be a valid reason it is also possible that the models just overstate the warming that co2 causes   but the odds stand at 20 1 that by their own parameters   the models are overstating the warming   interestingly enough natural cycles like el were put forth as a possible explanation for the warming in the 80 's and 90 's   that explanation was not accepted by at the time they have long resisted using natural cycles to explain the pause because they then have to admit it played a large role in the warming as well but when you get desperate

12 is ridiculously high and routine for loans with no credit history esp from the dealer i do n't think though paying off would hurt your credit you 've already got installment loan on your report and you have history of payments so it should n't matter how long the history is warning this is kind of guesswork compiled from personal experience and stuff read on the net since officially how credit score calculated is top secret   if you have the loan and credit card with good payments only thing you need to build credit is time and of course keeping everything nicely paid of course if you could find a loan with lower rate somewhere it 's be great to refinance but with low credit you would probably not get the best rates from anywhere unfortunately

disclaimer i ’m not an expert   this is my basic understanding which i ’m sure someone will be glad to tell is horribly wrong   you need an llc   many people in my area create an llc management company then create individual llcs for each investment property   laws vary by state   ymmv   then you start researching properties   commercial loans typically require a higher equity position than home ownership    assume minimum 30   for ease of this conversation let ’s say you ’re making the horribly poor decision to put that towards a single property    you ’d be looking for a property in the 175 200k value range because you ’ll need to account for settlement expenses attorney broker consultants and a cash reserve   you ’d be also be looking for what the average cap rate is for your market   in simplistic terms cap rate is the expected rate of return after expenses   so if the average market cap rate in that region for comparable properties is 5 you can expect around 5 return on your investment after you pay fees maintenance taxes insurance interest etc   buy a property and hold that property for a few years making money every year and claiming deductions on your earnings for something called depreciation   fast forward 5 years and you ’re ready to sell the value of your property went up because you made improvements along the way brought in some better tenants who are paying higher rents and now you can offer a better cap rate than your competitors   you sell in the blink of an eye and double your investment   say you have $ 500k now sitting in the bank in you llc ’s name in cash   you can either choose to cash out 100 and pay capital gains tax on your earnings above your basis at 15 i think or you can quickly find a new property with that $ 500k purchase it and file a 1031 which says you do n’t have to pay any capital gains on those earnings   you just increased income significantly without ever paying taxes on the underlying increase in value of your assets   rinse and repeat for 25 years develop a portfolio of properties create a management company so you can stop paying others a percentage of your earnings and you too can have the problem of too much money   i welcome anyone with actual knowledge of the topic to please on or correct me

the biggest and primary question is how much money you want to live on within retirement the lower this is the more options you have available you will find that while initially complex it does n't take much planning to take complete advantage of the tax system if you are intending to retire early are there any other investment accounts that are geared towards retirement or long term investing and have some perk associated with them tax deferred tax exempt but do not have an age restriction when money can be withdrawn   i 'm going to answer this with some potential alternatives the us tax system currently is great for people wanting to early retire if you can save significant money you can optimize your taxes so much over your lifetime if you retire early and have money invested in a roth ira or a traditional 401k that money ca n't be touched without penalty until you 're let 's ignore roth contributions that can technically be withdrawn ok the 401k myth the i 'm hosed if i put money into it since it 's stuck perspective is n't true for a variety of reasons if you retire early you get a long amount of time to take advantage of retirement accounts one way is to primarily contribute to pretax 401k during working years after retiring begin converting this at a very low tax rate you can convert money in a traditional ira whenever you want to be roth you just pay your marginal tax rate which for an early retiree might be 0 then after 5 years you now have a chunk of principle that has become roth principle and can be withdrawn whenever let 's imagine you retire at 40 with 100k in your 401k pretax for 5 years you convert $ 20k assuming married because we get $ 20k between exemptions deduction it means you pay $ 0 taxes every year while converting $ 20k of your pretax ira to roth or if you have kids even more after 5 years you now can withdraw that 20k year 100 tax free since it has become principle this is only a good idea when you are retired early because you are able to fill up all your free income for tax conversions when you are working you would be paying your marginal rate but your marginal rate in retirement is 0 related thread on a forum you might enjoy this is sometimes called a roth pipeline basically assuming you have no income while retired early you can fairly simply convert traditional ira money into roth principle this is then accessible to you well before the age but you get the full benefit of the pretax money but let 's pretend you do n't want to do that you need the money and tax benefit now how beneficial is it to do traditional 401ks imagine you live in a state city where you are paying 25 marginal tax rate if your expected marginal rate in your early retirement is 10 15 you are still better off putting money into your 401k and just paying the 10 penalty on an early withdrawal in many cases for high earners this can actually still be a tax benefit overall the point is this just because you have to work to get money out of a 401k early does not mean you lose the tax benefits of it in fact current tax code really does let an early retiree have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the roth traditional 401k ira question are you limited to a generic taxable brokerage account currently a huge perk for those with small incomes is that long term capital gains are taxed based on your current federal tax bracket if your federal marginal rate is 15 or less you will pay nothing for long term capital gains until this income pushes you into the 25 federal bracket   this might change but right now means you can capture many capital gains without paying taxes on them this is huge for early retirees who can manipulate income you can have significant income and not pay taxes on it you can also stack this with before mentioned roth conversions convert traditional ira money until you would begin owing any federal taxes then capture long term capital gains until you would pay tax on those combined this can represent a huge amount of money per year so littleadv mentioned hsas but for an early retiree they can be ridiculously good what this means is you can invest the maximum into your hsa for 10 years let it grow 100 tax free and save all your medical receipts etc then in 10 years start withdrawing that money while it sucks healthcare costs so much in america you might as well take advantage of the tax opportunities to make it suck slightly less there are many online communities dedicated to learning and optimizing their lives in order to achieve early retirement the question you are asking can be answered in the above but for a comprehensive plan you might want other resources some you might enjoy

mortgage or other interest rates are determined by the banks on cost of funds risk and operating cost    the fed raises money from the markets by issuing bonds at a specified rate this rate at which it raises money varies on the economy thus there are 2 rates the rate at which banks can borrow money from the fed which is higher than the rate that the fed would give banks for excess money deposited with them so if the cost of borrowing is less banks can borrow this money from the fed and loan it to individuals at a slightly higher rate that would cover their costs plus a small profit the risk associated with a mortgage is less and hence these would be cheaper then say a personal loan   if the cost of borrowing goes up the mortgage rate will go up if the cost of borrowing money goes down the cost would come down banks may not always borrow money to lend if they have existing money they can either park it with the fed for a lower interest rate or loan it to individuals for a rate higher than what they would have received from the fed

you say your primary goal is to clean up your credit report and you 're willing to spend some cash to do it    ok   but beware the law in this area is a mirror everything works upside down and backwards to start let 's be clear credit reports are not extortion to force you into paying they are a historical record of your creditworthiness and almost impossible to fix without altering history   paying on this debt will affirm the old data was correct and glue it to your report   here 's how credit reporting works for sent to collections amounts   the data is on your credit report for 7 years   the danger is in this clock being   what will not restart the clock   ignoring the debt talking to collectors and the debt being sold from one collector to another   what will restart the clock acknowledging the debt formally court judgment paying the debt or paying on the debt obviously paying the debt   crazy   you could have a debt that 's over 7 years old pay it because you 're a decent person and boom clock and 7 more years of bad luck   even if they write off or forgive any part of the debt that 's income and you 'll need to pay income tax on it   ugh   like i say the only way to remove a bad mark is to alter history simple fact    the collector does n't care about your bad credit mark he wants money and it costs a lot of money time and/or stress for both of you to demand they research it negotiate play phone tag and ultimately go to court   so this works very well this is just the guts you have to add all the who what where signature block formalities etc    1 company and customer absolutely disagree as to whether customer owes    company this debt explicitly named debt with numbers and amount 2 but company and customer both eagerly agree that the expense time and    stress of research negotiation and litigation is burdensome for both of us     we both strongly desire a quick final and no fault solution   therefore   3 parties agree customer shall pay company acceptable fraction here     payment within 30 days   to be acknowledged in writing by company   4 this shall be absolute and final resolution   5 no fault   parties agree this settlement resolves the matter in good faith    parties agree this settlement is done for practical reasons this bill has not been established as a valid debt and any difference between billed and settled amount is not a canceled nor forgiven debt   6 neither party nor its assigns will make any adverse statements to third parties relating to this bill or agreement   parties agree they have a continuous duty to remove adverse statements and agree to do so within seven days of request   7 parties specifically agree no adverse mark nor any mark of any kind shall be placed on customer 's credit report and in the event such a mark appears parties will it continuously   parties agree that a good credit report has a monetary value and specific impacts on a customer 's life   8 jurisdiction of law shall be where the effects are felt and that shall be place of service regarding the amounts of the bill proper   counterparts witness signature lines blah blah a collector is gon na sign this because it 's free money and it 's not tricky   what does this do   1 2 and 5 alter history to make the debt never have existed in the first place   to do this it must formally answer the question of why the heck would you pay a debt that is n't real and you do n't owe out of sheer practicality it 's cheaper than   this is your get out of jail free card both with the credit bureaus and the irs    of course 3 gives the creditor motivation to go along with it   6 says they ca n't burn your credit 7 says it again and they 're agreeing you can sue for cash money   8 lets you pick the court   the collector wo n't get hung up on any of these since he can easily remove the bad mark do n't be mad that they wo n't do it for free that 's what 3 is for   the key to getting them to take a settlement is to be reasonable and fair   make sure the agreement works for them too   6 says you ca n't them on social media 4 and 5 says it ca n't be used against them 8 throws them a bone by letting them sue in their home court for the bill they just settled a right they already had   if it 's medical add does not apply to this document to save them a ton of paperwork   make it easy for them you want the collector to take it to his boss and say this is pretty good do it   do n't send the money until their signed copy is in your hands   then send promptly with an for the receipt   make it easy for them   this is on you   as far as getting them to send you an offer creditors are reluctant to mail things especially to people they do n't think will pay because it costs them money to write and send   so you may need to be proactive about running them down with your offer   like i say it 's a mirror

first of all congratulations on being in an incredible financial position   you have done well so let 's look at the investment side first    if you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8 growth and add 75,000 every year in 10 years you 'll have about $ million $ 800k of which is capital gain more or less due to market risk of course or $ after 30 tax   if you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7 you 'll have about $ 1.3 million $ of which is tax free capital gain so the insurance is costing you $ 430 k in opportunity cost since you could have done something different with the money for more return    the fund you mentioned vanguard wellington has a 10-year annualized growth of   at that growth rate the opportunity cost is $ 350k   even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5 growth rate the opportunity cost is $ now the life insurance   life insurance is a highly personal product but i ran a quick quote for a old male in good health and got a premium of $ 11,000 per year for a $ 2 m 10-year term policy   so the same amount of term life insurance costs only $ 110,000   much less than the $ in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you in addition you have a mortgage that 's costing you about $ 28 k per year now 3.5 of 800,000 why would you invest in a 1.7 insurance policy when you are paying a low 3.5 mortgage i would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible and get it paid off quickly then you do n't need life insurance   then you can do whatever you want   retire early invest and give like crazy travel the world whatever    i see no compelling reason to have life insurance at all let alone life insurance wrapped in a bad investment vehicle

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

you are really showing some wisdom here and congratulations on finishing college    its a lot about   if you buy a new car there is something like a chance you will get a car that will not need repairs   if you buy a car for $ 1200 there is probably a 20 chance that the car will only need minimal repairs   so the answer is there is no real guarantee that spending any amount of money you will end up with a car with no repairs you also ca n't assume that with buying a car it will immediately need repairs   its possible that you could spend 1200 on a car and it will need an oil change   in three months it might need brakes and in 6 months tires   if that is the case you could save up the money for repairs have you looked for a car   it will take some work but you might be able to find something in good condition for your budget    if you shop for a loan go with a good credit union or local bank   mostly you are looking for a low rate   however i would advise against it   you worked so hard on getting out of school without debt why start now    be weird and buy a car for cash   heck someone may be able to loan you a car for a short time while you save some money

it 's funny how you say they will resort to laws to stop consumers from getting what they want when in reality the so called upstarts are the ones on very thin ice with breaking the law   if you define netflix as an upstart then i can already see that we do n't agree on the same premise and hence further argument is pointless   and for the record was only possible with tv and all the talented people in production   do you really think youtube or netflix will be able to produce a quality show   i think not   like i pointed out everyone is giving too much credit to netflix because it 's easy to stream a show after the risk has already been taken to spend the time and money to produce a show   this is why these upstarts operate on a profitable margin they are eating tv cable 's lunch   i am all for tv i believe that tv will still be around 50 years from now   the internet and tech is very volatile and you never know where it will stand 5 even 10 years from now   in the end people do not want to watch cheap low quality comedy on their iphones   60 inch lcd home theaters are here to stay in peoples homes   maybe it will be streamed via the internet but tv will very much still pull a lot of weight   afterall tv built the industry they deserve to own it     i do n't see the logic and destroying tv to benefit companies like apple or netflix who really have no idea how to even begin on a quality show    this boils down to the fact that people will always consume the cheapest form of entertainment and while this is true   americans are sophisticated enough to distinguish cheap from quality   tv delivers quality and will continue to deliver quality while the internet delivers a few occasional packaged in mediocrity

he is assuming flat structural growth    amazon is turning no profit because they are a services company not a hardware company they use all their money to invest in infrastructure to expand their services amd needs to spend a lot of money to operate a fab to produce chips while amazon keeps spending money to expand new business units offering greater services    imagine you are a toll bridge operator you build a bridge and collect a toll but instead of declaring the fees collected as profit you start construction of another bridge paid for by the profits of the first you are pretty careful not to go crazy with debt so you break even all the time    20 year later you have 10 bridges paying for the next ten to be built those 20 will pay for the next 20 their bridge membership club keeps customers using existing bridges and automatically brings in customers for newly built ones    of course it took amazon so long to catch the largest retailer and so little to double them    the next large play is really large the whole foods purchase they bought the foundational land for hundreds of small bridges to more easily connect them to even more bridge users    once amazon is done growing and they have thousands of bridges collecting tolls all over the world the money flow will be absolutely insane    but they will still be breaking even as they will be buying fleets of aircraft and other international chains for further delivery but the small profit they declare will still be pretty big it wo n’t be apple sized profit but it will be an amazing amount of revenue    amazon is to big box retail what big box retail was to mom pop retail the oxygen remover    they want to be the toll booth operator for all retail in the entire world

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

imagine a $ 1,000 face value bond paying 10 interest semi annually that means every 6 months there is $ 50 being paid now if the price of that bond doubled to $ 2,000 what is the yield it is still paying $ 50 every 6 months but now sports a 5 yield as the price went up a great deal similarly if the price of the bond was cut in half to $ 500 now it is yielding 20 because it is still paying out the $ 50 every 6 months the dollar figure is fixed what percentage of the price it is can vary and that is why there is the inverse relationship between prices and yields note that the length of the bond is n't mentioned here where while usually longer bonds will have higher yields there can be inverted yield curves as well as calls on some bonds also inflation indexed and convertible bonds could have different calculations used as principal adjustments or possible conversion to stock can change a perception on the overall return

maybe you know something i do n't but as far as i 'm aware you ca n't get rid of it   student loans are with you for   you will be sent to collections but it does n't disappear after 7 years   settlements are incredibly rare unless your loan is ballooning in which case a settlement does n't change all that much   you will lose tax benefits the government will garnish 15 of your wages and you will be a debt slave until it 's paid off   defaulting on student loans is much much more painful than defaulting on private loans   the only exception to this is if you 've made 120 months of repayments while employed at a qualifying non profit or governmental organization   and even then it only applies to federal loans and there are exceptions better not refinance or the clock resets for example   also if you default you will no longer be eligible   private student loans have no escape and are equally   thank your elected representatives

we ’re buying the home right over $ 200,000 so that means he will only need to put down as a roughly $ 7000 i 'm with the others do n't call this a gift unless it is a gift    i 'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would their concerns   your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so then they could fall back on his   that may make more sense to them even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own   this works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan   it works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan   and your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan so this is just as good for you    at what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses typically a cash financing partnership would be 50/50 but since it ’s only a 3.5 down payment instead of 20 is that still fair surprisingly enough a 3.5 down payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20 down payment   so your suggestion of a split makes sense if 20 would give a split    i expected it to be considerably lower   the way that i calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the rent which i set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan   with a 20 down payment this would give him 84 equity   with 3.5 about 40 equity   i 'm not sure why 84 equity should be the equivalent of a 50 share but it may be a side effect of other expenses   perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share    note that if you increase the down payment to 20 your mortgage payment will drop substantially   the difference in interest between 3.5 and 20 equity is a couple hundred dollars   also you 'll be able to eliminate any pmi payment at 20    it could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment that that would give him the same 50 equity stake on a 3.5 down payment as he would get with a 20 down payment   the problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment   if he were to stop doing that for some reason you 'd have what is effectively a 50 increase in your rent   it would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down payment    if you could n't pay the mortgage it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity rent the property and take over the mortgage payment   if he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage it 's not evident that you 'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out   and it 's unlikely that you 'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms   but your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy you 'd inherit his equity in the house   if you 're making the entire mortgage payment that 's a stable situation    he 's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary   you 're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment   so even in the face of tragedy things can go on   and that 's important as otherwise you could lose your equity in the house

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

the buying service your credit union uses is similar to the one my credit union uses i have used their service several times there is no direct cost to use the service though the credit union as a whole might have a fee to join the service i have used it 4 times over the decades if you know what make and model you want to purchase or at least have it narrowed down to just a few choices you can get an exact price for that make model and options you do this before negotiating a price you are then issued a certificate you have to go to a specific salesman at a specific dealership but near a large city there will be several dealers to pick from   there is no negotiating at the dealership you still have to deal with a trade in and the financing option dealer credit union or cash but it is nice to not have to negotiate on the price of course there is nobody to stop you from using the price from the buying service as a goal when visiting a more conveniently located dealership that is what i did last time the first couple of times i used the standard credit union financing and the last time i did n't need a loan even if you do n't use the buying service one way to pay for the car is to get the loan from the credit union but get the rebate from the dealer many times if you get the low dealer financing you ca n't get the rebate doing it this way actually saves money speaking of rebates see how the buying service addresses them the big national rebates   were still honored during at least one of my purchases so it turned out to be the buying service price minus $ 1,000 if your service worked like my experience the cost to you was a little time to get the price and a little time in a different dealer to verify that the price was good

the idea being that if when the cad recovers i could see a gain of ~30 that is the big if maybe the usd and cad will return to their previous exchange rates maybe the cad will fall further you just do n't know you should try to keep a diversified pool of investments that may include some cash in various currencies but unless you think you will need the money in the next few years it should be mostly in other things if you do think you will need the money in the next few years it should be in a currency that is stable relative to the things you are likely to need it for

i do n't even know where to begin you 're truly all over the place the number of upvotes on your post has absolutely zero relevance to the fact that you believe trump has caused this minuscule reduction in the deficit you literally said it yourself you posted an article and stated let 's discuss and then when it was discussed your argument was completely refuted in a heartbeat why did n't you respond to 's post he laid out a rational argument to refute your opinion however you unfortunately did n't have the facts or understanding on the subject to back your opinion so instead you stayed away from that comment argument because it did n't reflect your biased way of thinking this is the basis of which the shrinking pro trump base now stand they project their opinions then cherry pick the feedback that helps them feel good about their opinions while refusing to respond to any arguments that have factual information amp merit   i 'm going to give you some advise is n't a good place for you to learn about the basics of economics and i know you do not know the bare basics because anyone with any clue about how modern economics works knows that a president can not enact true economic growth or can significantly reduce a national budget deficit in 8 months while not introducing amp passing one piece of meaningful legislature or enacting any piece of their economic agenda which both sides of the aisle are fully aware amp accept that trump has n't been able to accomplish yet   now this is going to put you in a tough spot the s&amp;p under obama was up 30 after his first 8 months in office by your rational obama grew the overall wealth of the top 500 companies in the u.s. by 30 before he was able to enact any legislature but no obama could n't have done that because he only introduced destructive economic legislature from the get go therefore the president must have no control over economic success or failure within their first year of the presidency before they can make use of their economic agenda however that would go against your entire argument you set forward in this post puts you in a bit of a    sorry for the long response it 's just tough seeing someone make repeated simple basic economic mistakes in the subreddit feel free to pm me if you 're looking for some good books to get you started

the settlement date for any trade is the date on which the seller gets the buyer 's money and the buyer gets the seller 's product   in us equities markets the settlement date is almost universally three trading days after the trade date   this settlement period gives the exchanges the clearing houses and the brokers time to figure out how many shares and how many dollars need to actually be moved around in order to give everyone what they 're owed and then to actually do all that moving around so settling a short trade is the same thing as settling any other trade   it has nothing to do with closing or covering the seller 's short position q is this referring to when a short is initiated or closed a initiated   if you initiate a short position by selling borrowed shares on day 1 then settlement occurs on day 4   regardless of whether your short position is still open or has been closed q all open shorts which are still open by the settlement date have to be reported by the due date a not exactly   the requirement is that all short positions evaluated based on their settlement dates rather than their trade dates still open on the deadline have to be reported by the due date you sell short 100 aapl on day 1   you then cover that short by buying 100 aapl on day 2 as far as the clearing houses and brokers are concerned however you do n't even get into the short position until your sell settles at the end of day 4 and you finally get out of your short position in their eyes when your buy settles at the end of day 5 so imagine the following scenarios the nasdaq deadline happens to be the end of day 2   since your finra member broker has been told to report based on settlement date it would report no open position for you in aapl even though you executed a trade to sell on day 1 the nasdaq deadline happens to be the end of day 3   your sell still has not settled so there 's still no open position to report for you the nasdaq deadline happens to be the end of day 4   your sell has settled but your buy has not so the broker reports a 100 share open short position for you the nasdaq deadline happens to be the end of day 5   your sell and buy have both settled so the broker once again has no open position to report for you so the point is that when dealing with settlement dates you just pretend the world is 3 days behind where it actually is

i recommend you take a look at this lecture really the whole series is enlightening from swenson he identifies 3 sources of returns diversification timing and selection he appears to discard timing and selection as impossible a student kinda calls him out on this diversification reduces risk not increase returns it turns out they did time the market by shorting .com 's before the bubble and real estate just before the downturn in 1990 yale started a absolute return unit and allocated like 15 percent to it mostly by selling us equities that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves as for why you might employ managers for specific areas consider that the expense ratio wall street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in yale 's portfolio so they hire internally to reduce expenses and i 'm sure they 're kept busy they also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge finally in some areas you functionally can not invest without management for example yale has a substantial allocation in private equity and by definition that does n't trade on the open market the other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009 for a technique that 's supposed to reduce volatility they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years

the stock market exists for two reasons it lets companies raise money to invest and it lets company owners cash out and get money instead of part ownership of a company when they are ready to do so but to accomplish these goals effectively it needs many more transactions than just those kinds of transaction because you have to be able to find a buyer when you need one and to have a market price so there are also a lot of transactions that are just to try to make short term profit but we need those transactions to provide the market liquidity to let the stock market work properly for its actual purposes

i 'm sorry you are going through this but what you are dealing with is exactly is how cosigning works   it is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100 prepared to pay the loan on their behalf unfortunately the main benefit to cosigning a loan is to the bank they do n't care who makes payments only that someone does it is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in what your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is the biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you can not force your friend to do anything if it is for a car your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling guidance on this sort of thing look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there you can sue your friend in small claims court but keep in mind it also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income while it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court if it 's for $ 500 it probably is n't worthwhile but if your friend just stopped paying off their $ 30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it even though they can pay for it themselves

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

it is true as noted that you generally do not know when stock that you 're holding has been loaned by your broker to someone for a short sale that you generally consent to that when you sign up somewhere in the small print and that the person who borrows has to make repay and dividends the broker is on the hook to make sure that your stock is available for you to sell when you want so there 's limited risk there there are some risks to having your stock loaned though   the main one is that you do n't actually get the dividend   formally you get a substitute payment in lieu of dividends   the payment in lieu will be taxed differently   whereas qualified dividends get reported on form 1099-div and get special tax treatment substitute payments get reported on form 1099-misc box 8 is just for this purpose   substitute payments get taxed as regular income not at the preferred rate for dividends the broker may or may not give you additional money beyond the dividend to compensate you for the extra tax whether or not this tax difference matters depends on how much you 're getting in dividends your tax bracket and to some extent your general perspective if you want to vote your shares and exercise your ownership rights then there are also some risks   the company only issues for the number of shares issued by them   on the broker 's books however the short sale may result in more long positions than there are total shares of stock financially the extra longs are offset by shorts but for voting this does not balance i 'm unclear how this is resolved i 've read that the the brokers essentially depend on shareholder apathy but i 'd guess there 's more to it than that if you want to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares you have some options

rule of thumb the earlier you pay down your balance the less interest you will accrue and the faster you will pay off the debt as a whole but lets play with some real numbers here   you cited $ 5000 balance and a $ 750 payment but with various bills and things adding onto the balance over the course of a month now if your purchases and payments add up to the same number you are in a losing game so for the sake of argument i am going to say you are putting $ 500 + interest on the card each month and making a $ 750 payment   we also need an interest rate to work with i am going to use and 30 day months to keep the math a bit easier to follow    you basically have two choices in this scenario you can pay 750 a month on the card then use it to make your $ 500 in purchases other payments over time as you suggest in your question   or you can pay $ 250 and hold back $ 500 to make those other payments directly without running them through the card as has been suggested in some other answers so let us compare the two if i start the cycle at $ 5000 make a $ 250 payment on the first day of the cycle then have no other activity i will have a balance of $ for the month and accrue $ in interest at the close of the cycle   balance going into the next period is now $   carry this out for a year and your balance at the close of the 12th cycle is $ and $ of your payments went to interest by contrast if you pay $ 750 at the start of the month then add $ 100 back every 6 days so that you spend $ 500 over the course of the cycle you will have an average daily balance of $ which results in $ in interest charges being accrued at the end of the month   this gives you a balance of $ going into the next cycle putting you about $ 3 ahead of the previous method   push this pattern out for a year and your ending balance is with going to interest   resulting in a savings of over making the smaller payment and paying cash for your other expenses   if this happens to be a rewards card you also have gained whatever rewards benefit it gives you this demonstrates that by the strict numbers game the scenario you propose should come out a small but measurable distance ahead of making a smaller payment in order to avoid putting things back on the card   so why do so many people advise you to not do this    most of it has to do with psychology and risk   the cash method does not leave any room for you to over spend   you have or locked up the credit card so it ca n’t be used casually and when you run out of cash you ca n’t spend any more   which forces you to pay much closer attention to where your money is going    when you are running things through the credit card you generally do n’t have that hard stop unless you are up against your credit limit and even then most issuers are quite happy to let you go over and charge you extra fees for doing so   so if you have this plan where you are intending to put $ 500 on the card in a month then lose track of something you did early in the month and inadvertently spend $ 800 you are digging yourself deeper into the hole instead of climbing your way out there is also a risk in terms of income loss   in the cash method you no longer have the money to spend and you are forced to make the hard decisions about where to allocate what you do have making you much more likely to cut back on luxury items to preserve the necessities   in the card method it is easy to say eh the card has room i can catch up again later and not realize the mess you are causing yourself until you are in way over your head   i personally have run all my bills through a credit card in the past so that i could have one single payment to make   then i was unemployed for six months and ended up moving before i found a new job   everything in between including the move went on the card   next thing i know i am carrying a balance of $ 15k where i used to always have it paid in full   it took roughly 10 years including several years of working strictly in cash to get that back under control i currently have a card that is carrying a balance and i am running select expenses such as fuel and food through it while i the balance back down   most of my main bills are still paid directly from cash specifically so that i do n’t fall back into the same trap i did before   even so there were several months in the past year where the balance was creeping up instead of down because we were not paying that close of attention to our spending    then my wife lost her job and it forced us to closely evaluate where our money was going   we still run certain things through said card but we are much stricter about it being only those select things and the balance is trending down again   the main reason we are still those expenses that way is because this is a cash back reward card and we will be getting roughly $ 1000 back here in a couple more months

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

wikipedia has a detailed article explaining this a standard commercial letter of credit lc is a document issued mostly by a financial institution used primarily in trade finance which usually provides an irrevocable payment undertaking so yes they are primarily for use by businesses if you will read the article stating the terms and conditions for payment and shipment you will realize that such model wo n't be of much value to and will create many hurdles for a typical consumer yes you can cash a letter of credit but only once the conditions in the letter have been met e.g. delivery shipment of goods services an array of documents need to be presented as well whether it is easy or not is a very subjective question   a bank will issue a letter of credit only when it is reasonably sure that its risk is covered backed by a bank deposit or by conditions in the letter itself obviously derivatives on these letters have evolved as well

even if you can get a credit card with a $ 0 limit that does n't necessarily mean that the charges wo n't succeed some of my credit cards have gone over limit by a significant amount e.g. 140 of limit without any transactions being declined the limit just means that the bank is allowed to decline the transaction but they are also allowed to approve it anyway so basically what you would have is a credit card where any transaction can always be declined or approved

a yes it does accomplish the goal of adding more money but the money is in lieu of any return you can earn while the loan is outstanding if you somehow knew exactly which periods where going to run negative and you took a 401k loan during that time you 'd be in pretty good shape but if you had that information you 'd probably be ruling the world in short order and would n't care much about a measly 401k b it 's a nice idea but unfortunately you are not allowed to set your own interest rate if you could your idea would work perfectly the interest rate is bank specific and is typically 1 2 points over prime but if your plan was to leave your money sitting in cash or low interest bearing accounts anyway the loan does actually achieve the goal of getting more money in there though it 's your money you are n't earning it

in most markets there are fixed fees known as commissions for instance with a retail broker in the stock market you can expect every trade to cost you $ 7.00 as an example it is $ 7.00 regardless of if you place a trade for $ 25 or $ 25,000 you will see that just opening the trade with a smaller amount will eat up all of your profits and a majority of your capital but if you opened the trade with more capital through the investment group then the $ 7.00 commission will be much less of a tax on your trade basically the only advantage is that the tax of commissions will be less if you have a larger account if the commission is a fixed dollar value which is not always true either regardless at $ 25 per month not many markets will be accessible there is also the possible educational aspect of investing with a group of people or it can simply be ideals

danger the affidavit is a legal document understand the risk of getting caught if you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property that is why they demand more down payment 20%+ and charge a higher rate   the document is n't about making sure you spend 183 + nights a year in the property it is making sure that it is n't a business and you are n't letting a 3rd party live in the property   if you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address or you change how the property is insured they will suspect that it is now a rental property   what can they do undo the loan ask for penalty fee limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future or a percentage of the profits how likely is it the exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive it will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market   it can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property hud and sister agencies lock out investors   during the initial selling period they do n't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner but is actually an investor note some local governments are interested not just in non investors but in properties being occupied therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year if they detect that you are n't really a resident living in the house that has tax penalties suggestion if you do n't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is you will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20 down payment then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in if you try and buy the condo with a non investment loan you will have to wait a year if you try and pay cash now and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental and still have to meet the investor requirements

the answer comes down to what you expect the future tax rate to be if that tax rate is the same 25 marginal here then it is a wash yes you will pay more taxes when you pull the money out with a traditional but it is the same fraction of the original contribution as when you pay the tax now to convert to roth all you did was invest uncle sam 's money well so if you expect to pay higher tax rate on retirement then a roth could be beneficial also a roth does not have a required minimum distribution but congress can change that and it has been proposed the argument for leaving the money in the traditional is that you expect a lower tax rate on retirement or you do n't trust that a future congress wo n't decide to add a nominal tax to roth distributions   now if there is a year where your tax rate is very low then a partial conversion may well be worth it also if you your balance is insufficient for a good portfolio and future contributions will be to a roth due to income limits then that would also be a very good reason to convert

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away

is there some evidence in the article or elsewhere that the purpose is to kill off these competitors rather than simply to compete   competition is normally considered good in these kinds of situations as it out better efficiencies for which an argument can be made here but taking actions specifically for the purpose of killing off competition is not good because it reduces the pressures on efficiencies   killing off competition by artificially lowering prices below real market value is considered dumping but i do n't really see evidence of that in the article is there some hidden somewhere or is the article just trying to make a point without any basis   i do have concerns about the amazon play but sensationalist or bias driven reporting wo n't help me puzzle through them

that 's only the market rate if there is nobody else willing to do the job for less   look at how things go in 3rd world countries the elite simply hire and armored vehicles helicopters to transport themselves around   you would have to prove somehow that your services are worth 1/2 their net worth and that nobody could do as good of a job for less than that   the rich communities become walled compounds with private keeping the riff out   in these countries there 's any number of willing young men to earn in a month what most of the country makes in a year to take up arms against their fellow citizens in defense of the elite   security just becomes another minor expense to keeping up a household

in the scenario you describe and really in any scenario by the nature of how option contracts work a higher strike put will necessarily be more expensive than the lower strike put everything else being equal the lower strike call will necessarily be more expensive than the higher strike call everything else being equal in put options the buyer has the right to sell stock for the strike price so the higher the strike price the more money the buyer of the put option can make by selling the shares of stock at a higher price in call options it 's the exact opposite buyers of the call option have the right to buy stock at the strike price the lower the strike price the better for the buyer they have the right to buy stock for a lower amount of money so it must be worth more

you 'd likely be subject to a lock up period before you could sell the shares along with possibly having other rules about how you could sell your shares as you 'd likely be seen as an insider that may have information that gives you an unfair advantage for selling the stock possibly depending on how far in advance you hold the shares you may or may not have adjustments in the valuation and number of shares as some companies may do a split or reverse split when preparing for an ipo a company i worked for in the late 1990s had an ipo and my stock options had a revised strike price because of a reverse stock split that was done prior to the ipo

simply put you can not beat the market if by being informed and following all relevant news you can arrive at the conclusion that company a will likely outperform company b in the future then having a stocks should be better than having b stocks or any e.g. index based mix of them but as the whole market has access to the very same information and will arrive at the same conclusion provided it is logically sound everybody will want a stocks which thus become expensive to the point where the expected return is average again   your only options of winning this race are to be the very first to have the important information insider trade or to arrive at different logical conclusions than the rest of the world which boils down do making decisions that are not logically sound good luck with that or assuming that almost everybody else is not logically sound go figure

it 's done by opening auction the opening auction between and    a random time between and    there will be called an auction period during which time    limit and market orders are entered    and deleted on the order book no    order execution takes place during    this period so it is possible that the    order book will become crossed this    means that some buy and sell orders    may be at the same price and some buy    orders may be at higher prices than    some sell orders at the end of the random start period    the order book is frozen temporarily    and an order matching algorithm is    run this calculates the price at    which the maximum volume of shares in    each security can be traded all    orders that can be executed at this    price will be filled automatically    subject to price and priorities no    additional orders can be added or    deleted until the auction matching    process has been completed the opening price for each stock will    be either a ut price or in the    event that there are no transactions    resulting form the auction then the    first at trade will be used

sit down with professional with knowledge about issues know how your options regarding the property ownership can impact the services they qualify for even making a change in ownership can impact their eligibility for certain programs some of which can reach back to events in the recent past also if you own it but she will get some of the profits when you sell she could still be considered an owner which can impact eligibility for programs this is in addition to the issues with the lender the irs and your estate

oh i agree that it is very likely to increase how often people go to the movies i just do n't know that at the $ 10/month price it 's likely to be profitable for moviepass    i think the big difference between my evaluation and mp 's of the strategy is that mp thinks it will eventually have enough leverage to get a share of concessions from theaters    based on the economics of the situation and the fact that theaters ultimately have more leverage as well as in person access to and mp customers plus the theaters history of specifically not doing what mp hopes they will do i think that 's a hell of gamble    edit    movie theaters are n't losing at all at this point because mp pays most of them full retail value for every ticket they 'll do very well i just do n't think they 're going to ever essentially give mp a cut out of the goodness of their hearts

i think we would be good with paying around $ 1200 monthly mortgage fees with all other property fees included like tax etc you probably ca n't get a $ 250k house for $ 1,200 a month including taxes and insurance   even at a 4 rate and 20 down your mortgage payment alone will be $ and with taxes and insurance on top of that you 're going to be over $ 1,200   you might get a lower rate but even a drop to 3 only lowers the payment $ getting a cheaper house which also reduces taxes and insurance is the best option financially what to do with the $ 15k that i have if you did n't have a mortgage i 'd say to keep 3 6 months of living expenses in an emergency fund so i would n't deplete that just to get a mortgage you 're either going to be   since 1 the mortgage payment would be tight and 2 you are n't able to save for a down payment my recommendation is for you to rent until you can make a 20 down payment and have monthly payment that is 25 of your take home pay or less   which means either your income goes up which you indicate is a possibility or you look for less house   ideally that would be on a 15-year note since you build equity and reduce interest much more quickly than a 3-year note but you can get the same effect by making extra principal payments also very few people stay in their house for 30 years 5 years is generally considered the cutoff point between renting and buying   since you 're looking at a 10-year horizon it makes sense to buy a house once you can afford it
