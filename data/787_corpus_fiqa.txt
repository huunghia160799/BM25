in general when companies are regarded as hot growth stocks they are expected to keep up an accelerated level of growth for a good long time that accelerated growth justifies a high pe relative to a slow growth stock when companies that are supposed to grow miss expectations or worse lose money the markets punish the stock severely particularly if the company does n't make analysts aware of problems early on netflix is a great example of a company a few different business problems creating a much bigger one in the process a poorly conceived rate hike killed the reliable cash flow of the company and that crazy thing just confused everyone now nobody trusts the management blackberry is another example of a high performing company that just screwed up damaging shareholders in the process we 're living in a very challenging era today but growth stocks are always risky by nature growing a company rapidly is very difficult

first of all to answer the basic question is one method correct might it depend on local laws yes it does depend on local laws because ultimately the business will have to file forms with the county city   these forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category tax free x% y% each transaction could have parts that fall into each category the local taxing authority decides what goes into each category the local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes they can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives   a business is not required to charge directly for sales tax that is why frequently at sporting events the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included i suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder but the state will still get their money rounding up at the end of the entire transaction is enough to make sure they collect enough taxes so they do n't have to dip into their profits

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

i assume by not so good prospects you mean small account clients whose revenue will not justify the time required to close a deal and/or post sale service   glad to see you are being realistic about the value of your time vs. what a prospect is paying     a big part of your practice is going to come down to what infrastructure processes your dealer firm or back office support has   is yours one with a formal small account policy that assigns servicing to a centralized service center aka call center     i 've also seen others separate direct at fund vs held in house based on client assets   small accounts go direct to at fund and are directed to the mutual fund transfer agent for post sale servicing needs   the up front sales charge compensates for the initial consultation and the rest is self servicing support by the fund transfer agent

in the uk using a credit card adds a layer of protection for consumers if something goes wrong or you bought something that was actually a scam if you inform the credit card company with the necessary documents they   will typically clear the balance for that purchase essentially the burden of debt is passed to them and they themselves will have to chase up the necessary people section 75 of the consumer credit act   i personally use my credit card when buying anything one would consider as   consumer spending tvs furniture ect i then pay off the credit card immediately this gives me the normal benefits of the credit card if you get cashback or points plus the additional consumer credit protection on all my purchases   this in my opinion is the most effective way of using your credit card

are there any advantages to layaway there are two main advantages first when you pay the initial deposit the seller reserves the item for you at a given price this is helpful with unique products like a high end custom made watch if there is only one of those watches in the entire world then it 's nice to know that the seller wo n't sell it to anyone else while you 're getting together the remaining funds and the price you 're paying is locked in second layaway agreements often allow for a payment plan this is helpful for people who have a hard time saving up money for many it 's easier to make smaller monthly payments than a large one time payment of course the cost of layaway is that you 're $ 30,000 short for up to 6 months this money could be generating a significant amount of interest during a half year period you 'll need to make sure that reserving the item and locking in the price are worth this cost

who computes the s&p 500 standard and poor 's why are they sharing this information and because that 's what they do this is a financial research company how do they recuperate the costs inherent in computing the s&p 500 by charging clients for other information the computing of the index itself is not all that complicated its coming up with the index that 's a problem once they 've come up with the formula and it became widely accepted the computation itself is not an issue but the fact that its so popular leads to the s&p brand recognition and people come and pay good money for their other services ratings and financial analysis of securities they do more work for free for example the ratings of various government debts are being done by s&p for free governments do n't pay for that while private bonds are rated for a fee corporations pay to have their bonds rated also as noted by there are probably some licensing fees for using the index name in the fund name and other users are probably paying the licensing fee like the news agencies and the exchanges s&p500 is a registered trademark and as such can not be used without the owner 's permission why is then active management not required for indexed funds because no research and stock picking is required in fact these funds do n't really require a manager they can be managed by a simple script and how does it lower taxes perhaps this could be a different    question if this has become too broad actively managed funds perform a lot more buy sell operations each leading to tax consequences to the fund which rolls them over to the investors index funds only buy and sell to re balance back to the index or when the makeup of the index changes usually once a year or half a year leading to much lesser realized capital gains to the fund thus much lesser tax consequences

there are some useful comments about the tradeoffs of the decisions in front of you   intertwined with the financial choices hopefully you can see a map opening up    make a little chart if it helps   benefit and cost   if you 're looking for financial options you will have to also add more columns to that chart   option and cost an example is the comment on making connections with rich kids   trust fund babies are everywhere in this country   did you know any rich kids while growing up   how were those rich kids you knew of back then in your school in your town   how did they treat you   were you ever invited to their parties or gatherings   now there 's an opportunity for the privilege to pay a lot of money to sit in a classroom next to them   even in the early days of american history with merit based millionaires who made it rich by the seat of their pants   at fancy dinner parties and a new term emerged to put each other again out of reach old money the deserving and new money    that 's my bias   you 'll have some of your own   what is important to you has to come through because these days the price tag of any higher education implies a considerable piece of your life 's timeline will be committed to something   make sure you get what you feel is worth that commitment take stock of what has been said here by the others but put a value on those choices and seriously consider what you 're willing to pay for and what you 're not   there is no formula for your success as there 's been thousands of exceptions every situation is different

let 's say that you want to invest in the stock market   choosing and investing in only one stock is risky   you can lower your risk by diversifying or investing in lots of different stocks   however you have some problems with this   when you buy stocks directly you have to buy whole shares and you do n't have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in you are n't even sure which stocks you should buy a mutual fund solves both of these problems   you get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks   that way your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one   and the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in so you do n't have to pick there are lots of mutual funds to choose from with as many different objectives as you can imagine   some invest in large companies others small some invest in a certain sector of companies utilities or health care for example some invest in stocks that pay a dividend others are focused on growth   some funds do n't invest in stocks at all they might invest in bonds real estate or precious metals   some funds are actively managed where the manager actively buys and sells different stocks in the fund continuously and takes a fee for his services and others simply invest in a list of stocks and rarely buy or sell these are called index funds to answer your question yes the jpmorgan emerging markets equity fund is a mutual fund   it is an actively managed stock mutual fund that attempts to invest in growing companies that do business in countries with rapidly developing economies

it 's called a pyramid scheme its illegal in almost every country of the western world you 're not going to earn lifetime income of course and these things collapse pretty quickly most of the common folks do n't return the investment its the organizers who take the money sometimes they run most times they end up in jail the way these schemes work is that they pay the early investors from the fees paid by new investors as long as a steady stream of new people keep signing up and paying into it those who got in very early make money the idea is based on the geometric of each new person signing up two or more people and those people doing the same pretty quickly at that rate you need to sign up every human being on the planet to keep the new money flowing in to make it work which obviously is not realistic ultimately a small of the people if they can stay out of jail will make a big amount of money the vast majority of investors get stiffed

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

rent to own is not a precise single agreement it can be whatever the seller and you agree to it 's a unique seller that would agree to this keep in mind most sellers are needing to get their money in full to buy their next house you might find an investor willing to work with you but only for an inflated price interest rate or both   the ideal seller would be underwater owing more than the value of the home but needing to move in which case they are hoping to find someone to buy them some time to get situated in their new house before moving forward with you and the bank to arrange a sale   at its simplest you might pay a premium on your rent to fix the price giving you the option to buy during a particular period at that price   it can be a much higher premium where you are renting and paying extra until you hit 20 at which point you agree to finance the balance either with a bank loan or through the seller   buying a home you will live in is a personal decision with no numbers offered it 's not like we can tell you if it 's a wise purchase

there are multiple etfs which inversely track the common indices though many of these are leveraged   for example tracks approximately of the s&p 500   note due to how these are structured they are only suitable for very short term investments you can also consider using put options for the various indices as well   for example you could buy a put for the spy out a year or so to give you some fairly cheap insurance assuming it 's a small part of your portfolio one other option is to invest against the market volatility   as the market makes sudden swings the volatility goes up this tends to be true more when it falls than when it rises   one way of in market volatility is to trade options against the vix

the barrier to entry is extremely high in the isp world you either have to piggyback on an existing isp and their lines or you lay your own obviously google is going with the latter which is a huge undertaking that not only involves the work to actually lay the fiber but also get regulatory approval and the funds to do so they have the resources to do this but only when the cities cooperate and work with them then there 's the work involved with setting up all of the networking infrastructure to actually route customer traffic set up agreements etc basically there are two kinds of entities that can do all this existing isps who obviously want to maintain the status quo and companies with lots of influence and money and technical resources you wo n't find a startup doing what google is doing at least not without some big players backing them

a $ 10,000 life insurance policy on a child only makes sense for a family that thus it could make sense many families are in this financial situation   a family in the combination of this financial situation and this emotional situation might be well served to seek religious counsel   if they find ways to remember loved ones without expensive funerals they could save money on insurance ironically a much larger life insurance policy for a child might make more sense   look at it this way   what is the replacement cost of a child a family that has only one son and any number of daughters or a family that has only one daughter and any number of sons stands to lose an obvious part of their genetic and cultural legacy if they lose that son or daughter it is expensive to bear and raise a child to a particular age   this cost increases as the child ages   the number of years of child raising cost obviously increases   also the cost of another child can go from very small to very large especially if fertility treatment or reversal surgery is required unfortunately most life insurance companies do not think of things this way   i am not aware of any 100,000 250,000 dollar children 's life insurance policies on the market

look for unsustainable policies and actions by policy makers both before and possibly during when looking at the forex markets   consider some examples each of those events could be seen in the growing of local policies   forex markets and local policies can appear to stay on an unsustainable path for a long time but equilibrium will force itself on everything in the long run   in two of the above cases the initial response was n't enough to offset the mess and more and more intervention had to be done only making matters worse   when you know how unsustainable policies are and how big the corrections need to be you can quickly ascertain whether an action by policy makers will be enough

can they change the weights yes will they it depends are etf 's fixed from their inception to their de listing it 's actually not possible for weights to be fixed since different assets have different returns so the weights are constantly changing as long as the market is moving usually after a certain period or a substantial market move fund managers would rebalance and bring the weights back to a certain target the target weights what your question is really about are n't necessarily the same as the initial weights but often times they are it depends on the objective of the etf which is stated in prospectus in your example if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile one the returns of the etf and the 5 stocks could be substantially different in the next period this is not desirable when the etfs objective is to track performance of those 5 stocks   most if not all etfs are passively managed the managers do n't get paid for active management so they do n't have incentive to adjust the weights if their funds are tracking the benchmarks just fine

in regards to purchasing full coverage on your car even if you can afford to replace it consider the hassle you have to deal with an accident that is not just the cost   as an example my sister 's car was stolen and wrecked   it was her problem to go recover the car on the other side of the state such that she would not be paying the storage fees imposed by the sheriff of the other county   had she had insurance they would have taken care of it call another story is that i rented a car and side swiped in the parking lot by a hit and run   i was responsible for the minor damage   i started down the path of paying out of pocket because it was small enough that i did not want to submit a claim   the rental car agency started to pile on extra fees such that it was worth it to turn in a claim   my insurance company was savvy enough to be able to dispute the extra charges   after i submitted it to the insurance company i basically did nothing   they took care of everything so in summary when you buy full coverage on your car it is not just a financial decision   it is also about not having to deal with a hassle

yes the speed bump explicitly can not impact the reports to the sip two years ago this would not be a big deal because the sip was stupidly slow especially under load so you send your report to the sip faster than you publish your own market data feed and the sip just takes forever to publish meaning your own market data feed still gets to the clients first   now that the sip is fast this is no longer the case you still as an exchange have to publish to the sip first or within microseconds of at the same time but if you have some sort of artificial delay on your market data that is longer than the sip processing time the sip updates will arrive first doubly so if the consumers are with one of the sips   edit for what it 's worth matt has a pretty solid write up covering nyse american but it pertains to iex as american attack of   bats also comments on this phenomenon in their sec comment letter on nyse american see footnote 1 on the first comments sr pdf the link is somewhat recursive since it points back to another of 's posts but still just as accurate an assessment

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

it depends how deep in the money it is compared to the dividend   even an in the money call has some time premium as the call holder if i exercise instead of selling the call i am trading the potential for a dividend which i wo n't receive for getting that time premium back by selling   given the above you 'll notice a slight distortion in options pricing as a dividend date approaches as the option will reflect not just the time premium but the fact that exercising with grab the dividend   edit to address your comment $ 10 stock $ 9 strike 50 cent div if the option price is high say $ 2 because there 's a year till expiration exercising makes no sense if it 's just $ 1.10 i gain 40 cents by exercising and selling after the dividend

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

there are two in investing active management and passive management passive management is based on the idea you ca n't beat the market passive investors believe in the efficient markets hypothesis the market all information about an asset so price is equal to underlying value another idea in this field is that there 's a minimum risk associated with any given return you ca n't increase your expected return without assuming more risk to see it graphically    as expected return goes up so does risk if we stat with a portfolio of 100 bonds then remove 30 bonds and add 30 stocks we 'll have a portfolio that 's 70 stocks turns out that this makes expected return increase and lower risk because of diversification markowitz showed that you could reduce the overall portfolio risk by adding a riskier but uncorrelated asset basically if your entire portfolio is us stocks then you 'll lose money whenever us stocks fall but if you have half us stocks quarter us bonds and quarter european stocks then even if the us market tanks half your portfolio will be unaffected theoretically adding different types of uncorrelated assets can reduce risk and increase returns   let 's tie this all together we should get a variety of stocks to reduce our risk and we ca n't beat the market by security selection ideally we ought to buy nearly every stock in the market so that   so what 's our solution why the exchange traded fund etf of course an etf is basically a bunch of stocks that trade as a single ticker symbol for example consider the spdr s&p 500 spy you can purchase a unit of spy and it will move up down proportional to the s&p 500 this gives us diversification among stocks to prevent any significant downside while limiting our upside how do we diversify across asset classes luckily we can purchase etf 's for almost anything gold etf 's commodities us bond etf 's domestic bonds international stock etfs intl bonds etfs etc so we can buy etf 's to give us exposure to various asset classes thus diversifying among asset classes and within each asset class determining what of our portfolio to put in any given asset class is known as asset allocation and some people say up to 90 of portfolio returns can be determined by asset allocation   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs across asset classes and just leave them you can readjust your portfolio holdings periodically but otherwise there is no rapid trading now the other umbrella is active management the idea is that you can generate superior returns by stock selection active investors reject the idea of efficient markets   a classic and time proven strategy is value investing after the collapse of bank stocks greatly fell but all the other stocks fell with them some stocks worth $ 100 were selling for $ 50 value investors quickly snapped up these stocks because they had a margin of safety even if the stock did n't go back to 100 it could go up to $ 80 or $ 90 eventually and investors profit the main ideas in value investing are have a big margin of safety look at a company 's fundamentals earnings book value etc and see if it promises adequate return coke has tremendous earnings and it 's a great company but it 's so large that you 're never going to make 20 profits on it annually because it just ca n't grow that fast another field of active investing is technical analysis as opposed to the fundamental analysis of value investing technical analysis involves looking at charts for patterns and looking at stock history to determine future paths things like resistance points and trend lines also play a role technical analysts believe that stocks are just ticker symbols and that you can use guidelines to predict where they 're headed   another type of active investing is day trading this basically involves buying and selling stocks every hour or every minute or just at a rapid pace day traders do n't hold onto investments for very long and are always trying to predict the market in the short term and take advantage of it many individual investors are also day traders   the other question is how do you choose a strategy the short answer is pick whatever works for you the long answer is day trading and technical analysis is a lot of luck if there are consistent systems for trading then people are keeping them secret because there is no book that you can read and become a consistent trader high frequency trading hft is an area where people basically mint money but it s more technology and less actual investing and would not be categorized as day trading   benjamin graham once said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine value investing will work because there 's evidence for it throughout history but you need a certain temperament for it and most people do n't have that furthermore it takes a lot of time to adequately study stocks and people with day jobs ca n't devote that kind of time so there you have it this is my opinion and by no means definitive but i hope you have a starting point to continue your study i included the theory in the beginning because there are too many monkeys on cnbc and the news who just do n't understand fundamental economics and finance and there 's no sense in applying a theory until you can understand why it works and when it does n't

usually when a stock is up trending or down trending the price does not go up or down in a straight line in an uptrend the price may go up over a couple of days then it could go down the next day or two but the general direction would be up over the medium term the opposite for a downtrend so if the stock has been generally going up over the last few weeks it may take a for a week or two before prices continue up again this is called a retracement in the uptrend the fibonacci levels are possible amounts by which the price might retract before it continues on its way up again by the way 50 is not actually a fibonacci retracement level but it is a common retracement level which is usually used in combination with the fibonacci retracement levels

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

as a rule of thumb no   only in very rare circumstances will it prove better than a rrsp   the media has overplayed the usefulness of this account type for retirement savings   that 's just a general rule   your specific situation will make a difference but it 's very easy to show that rrsps will always outperform if the marginal rates are lower on withdrawal than when you deduct contributions from income if you plan to use the money before retirement or you 're expecting to collect on retirement then you may need to look at the specifics of your situation   if you plan to put money in a rrsp and carry forward the deduction to use at a later date then it does n't matter whether you put it in a rrsp now or use the tfsa and transfer it later the rrsp also has advantages of some tax treaties and creditor protection   it as a can also be used after 65 for income splitting and the pension credit an resp can also provide a greater return as you get free money which is always good   there are many other things you can do with it but i 'd say it 's always better in a tfsa than paying tax in a regular account    since you pay the mortgage with after tax dollars that could be another option for the cash and it 's a guaranteed return albeit small nowadays

this is the best tl;dr i could make opinions republicans are victims of a discredited economic reduced by 81 i 'm a bot gt republicans have become trapped in their own rhetoric crafted during years of being in opposition   gt republican leaders have failed to recognize the fact that the economic views of those who voted republican in 2016 only slightly to the republicans could have used the trump election to effect a political one that would have combined a more moderate set of economic policies than the republican elite currently supports with a more moderate set of cultural positions than those espoused by leading democrats   gt several republican candidates supported a value added tax during the 2016 and a number of leading republicans including james baker george and henry paulson are now arguing for a carbon tax that would return all of the revenues raised to individuals in the form of a dividend    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords tax**^#2 more**^#4

yeah i agree what cat did was likely illegal but a lot of that was due to incompetence if done properly they could have ended up in the gray range where they could potentially justify their tax position to the irs    to the larger point though it just seems wasteful to play these games i understand everyone does it and that it 's part of the system it just all seems a bit ridiculous and i wonder if there 's a simpler solution that could benefit all stakeholders governments get similar revenues   without dealing with ridiculous complexities of tax avoidance schemes companies are more efficient and then efficiency or revenue gains can be passed onto workers my main worry however is that these gains would be passed onto executive bonuses instead

what is shocking to me are statements like this   the mid encourages affluent homeowners to buy more extravagant homes than they otherwise would    no shit sherlock when anyone is buying a home and they have $ x mo to spend they factor in the deduction and conclude they can spend 10 30 more on a house so they buy bigger or more expensive houses its like the authors of the law thought people would spend the same amount on a house regardless of the deduction rather than factor in the deduction into what they can afford

you 're confusing so many things at once here first thing first we can not suggest you what to do business wise since we have no idea about your business how on earth can anyone know if you should sell the software to someone or try to distribute to customers yourself how would we know if you should hire employees or not if you say you do n't need employees why would you consider hiring them if you say you want to sell several copies and have your own customers why would you ask if you should sell your code to someone else does n't make sense now to some more specific issues i heard sole proprietary companies does n't earn more than 250k and    it 's better to switch to corporation or llc etc because of benefits i heard it was today in honolulu so you heard things it does n't make them true or relevant to you there 's no earning limit above which you should incorporate you can be sole proprietor and make millions and you can incorporate for a $ 10k year revenue business sole proprietorship incorporation can be c corp or s corp or llc these are four different types of legal entity to conduct business each has its own set of benefits and drawbacks and you must understand which one suits you in your particular situation for that you should talk to a lawyer who could help you understand what liability protection you might need and to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state who can help you understand the tax related costs and benefits of each choice on the other hand i heard that if i create llc company in case of    failure they can get everything from me what 's this all about no this is not true who are they how do you define failure and why would they get anything from you at all even without knowing all that your understanding is wrong because the ll in llc stands for limited liability the whole point of forming llc or corporation is to limit your own personal liability but mere incorporation or forming llc does n't necessarily mean your liability is limited your state law defines what you must do for that limited liability protection and that includes proper ways to run your business again talk to your lawyer and your tax adviser about what it means to you i 'm totally unfamiliar with everything related to    taxes companies llc corporation etc familiarize yourself no one is going to do it for you start reading ask specific questions on specific issues and get a proper legal and tax advice from licensed professionals

perhaps the real question you are asking is how can the tax code be fixed to make it simple for everyone including me and what would it take to effect those changes there are really two causes for the complexity of the tax code many of those who enter government hold a desire for power and government uses the tax code as one lever of power to distribute to their supporters and to nudge everyone to behaviors which they favor the current system enables incumbents to spend taxpayer money to reward those they favor and thus they accumulate power and security those who enter government also love to spend money especially other people 's money and their behavior recognizes no boundaries they will spend money without control until the taxpayers them to a brutal stop they enact complex rules which are used to ease the tax burden for some which buys their support with taxpayer money and they spend money to benefit those which they favor the system of lobbyists and contributors exists to entice government to treat them and the causes they support favorably this system enables incumbents to spend taxed money to reward those they favor and to tax those they thus their greed is satisfied and their power is increased the freedom you seek is not available although you can minimize the effort required for compliance you can take the standard deduction and use nothing but the w-2 provided by your employer and unless you are subject to the alternative minimum tax you will find that the tax software will do most of the work for you do you want to approach the of minimal effort to appease your tax collectors avoid starting your own business charitable donations investment income 1099 income and you will need minimal paperwork avoid earning enough to risk the amt alternative minimum tax refuse to take the mortgage interest deduction tax credits for electric vehicles tax credits for high efficiency appliances and air conditioners tax credits for residential solar panel installations do not own investments which pay interest or own stocks where you need to track the basis purchase price of the stocks nor buy and then sell valuable items that might gain value where you would need to track the purchase price the basis avoid owning and leasing a rental home for income deducting businesses expenses and mileage for business purposes contributions to a retirement plan outside an employer plan all complicate your tax filing the solution you truly desire is either a flat tax or the fair tax these solutions would effect either a single tax rate with no deductions or adjustments to income yeah right or a national retail sales tax which would tax the money spent in the economy regardless of the source of the money legal gifts crime and there would be no need to report income or classify it the largest objection to either is that the tax code might become less progressive increasing tax rate with increasing income good luck

i still think the biggest thing they have to get right is getting rid of the driver and making cars perfectly autonomous   if that happens there could be a serious disruption to the market because the price of an uber lyft etc just dropped in half i would bet i do n't doubt that ford gm tesla can make the cars but it 's going to take a little while to make economic sense to just abandon driving a car   the other thing this article leaves out is the demand for non gasoline products growing globally think plastics jet fuel and asphalt   thus i do n't see big oil crashing in the next 5 10 years but it may become a tighter market with a few big players as margins get thinner and companies go bankrupt

the literal answer to your question is that a number of different types of mutual funds did not have significant downturns in 2008 money market funds are intended to always preserve capital made in 2008 it was a major scandal broke the buck that its holders took a 3 loss inverse funds which go up when the market goes down obviously did well that year but if you have a low risk tolerance that 's obviously not what you 're looking for and they have other problems as well when held long term but you 're a old talking about your retirement funds you should have a much longer time horizon at least 30 years over a period that long stocks have never had negative real inflation adjusted returns dating back at least to the civil war if you look at the charts here or here you can see that despite the risk in any individual year as the period grows longer the average return for the period gets tighter and tighter if you look at the second graph here you see that 2011 was the first time since the civil war that the trailing 30-year return on t bills exceeded that for stocks and 1981 2011 was period that saw bond yields drop almost continuously leading to steady rise in bond prices although past performance is no guarantee of future results everything we 've seen historically suggests that the risk of a broad stock market portfolio held for 30 years is not that large and it should make up the bulk of your holdings for example vanguard 's target retirement fund is 90 in stocks us + international and only 10 in bonds

you should hire a lawyer the fact that they told you your personal information shows that they actually had it and are not which is a good thing the fact that they mislead you means that their intentions are not pure which is not surprising coming from a collection agency of course when dealing with collections or any matter of significance for that matter do n't rely on their recording of the call because they can always conveniently lose it make sure to write down every single detail discussed including the date and time of the call and the id name of the person on the other side if possible make your own recording notifying them of it of course it 's too late to record the calls now but do try to as much information as possible to provide to your lawyer to deal with it in the end of the day they will either provide you with the recording and then you might be surprised to hear that what they said was not in fact what you thought they said and it was just your wishful thinking it is very possible to be indeed the case or claim we lost it and then it will be a problem to either of you to prove who said what but they 'll have the better hand having better lawyers in convincing the court that you 're the one trying to avoid paying your debts that is why proper representation at all stages is important as to the bankruptcy it wo n't help for student loans student loans is one of the very few types of debts you ca n't really run away from you have to solve this the sooner the better get a professional advice for the future and for the other readers you should have gotten the professional advice before defaulting on these loans and certainly after the first call

market capitalization is the equity value of a company it measures the total value of the shares available for trade in public markets if they were immediately sold at the last traded market price some people think it is a measure of a company 's net worth but it can be a misleading for a number of reasons share price will be biased toward recent earnings and the earnings per share eps metric the most recent market price only reflects the lowest price one market participant is willing to sell for and the highest price another market participant is willing to buy for though in a liquid market it does generally reflect the current consensus in an imperfect market for example with a large institutional purchase or sale prices can diverge widely from the consensus price and when multiplied by outstanding shares can show a very distorted market capitalization it is also a misleading number when comparing two companies market capitalization because while some companies raise the money they need by selling shares on the markets others might prefer debt financing from private lenders or sell bonds on the market or some other capital structure some companies sell preferred shares or non voting shares along with the traditional shares that exist all of these factors have to be considered when valuing a company large cap companies tend to have lower but more stable growth than small cap companies which are still expanding into new markets because of their smaller size

the is calculated by taking = dividing this number by 100 gives you the answer 100 = when dealing with it 's important to remember the relationship between a decimal and a percent 1 = .01 to return .01 to a percent you must multiple that number by 100   so .01 x 100 = 1 in order to get a decimal from a percent which is what is used in calculations you must divide by 100 so here if we are trying to calculate how much interest you are paying each month we can do this = $ interest you will pay that year if the principal balance never changed 12 = now month two = 12 = in order to get your monthly payments which wo n't change for the life of the loan you can use this formula monthly payment = where   interest rate remember if calculating monthly to do present value of loan n = time of loan in your case 36 since we are talking monthly and 12 3 = 36 from here we get = $ when rounding is $ as far as actual applied interest rate i 'm not even sure what that number is but i would like to know once you figure out since the interest rate you 're being charged is most definitely

dividends are paid based on who owns the security on a designated day   if a particular security pays once per year you hold days and sell on the day before the critical day you get no dividend   this is not special to 401(k or to drip   it 's just how the system works the critical day is the day before the posted ex dividend date for the security if you own at the end of that day you get the dividend   if you sell on that day or before you do not your company changing providers is not in itself relevant   the important factor is whether you can still hold your same investments in the new plan   if not you will not get the dividend on anything that you currently hold but sell due to the change in providers   if you can then you potentially get the dividend so long as there 's no glitch in the transition incidentally it works the other way too   you might end up getting a dividend through the new plan for something that you did not hold the full year

if you can get to a physical branch get a cashier 's check or call them and have them send you one by mail   when they draft the cashier 's check they remove the money from your account immediately and the check is drawn against the bank itself   you could hold onto that check for a little while even after your account closes and you make other arrangements for banking if you can not get a cashier 's check then you should try to open a new account and do an ach from old to new   this might take more days to set up than you have left though

in my experience buy to let mortgages charge a higher rate of interest than an personal residential mortgage   they are regarded as a business enterprise and presumably the banks calculate that they carry a higher risk   a bank would probably take action if the property on an ordinary mortgage was rented out as you would be breaking their terms   policies could be rendered void   the terms on an ordinary mortgage disallow renting out the property

in general you are expected to pay all the money you owe in taxes by the end of the tax year or you may have to pay a penalty but you do n't have to pay a penalty if the amount you owe i.e. total tax due minus what you paid in withholding and estimated taxes is less than $ 1000 you paid at least 90 of your total tax bill you paid at least 100 of last year 's tax bill i think point 3 may work for you here suppose that last year your total tax liability was say $ 5,000 this year your tax on your regular income would be $ 5,500 but you have this additional capital gain that brings your total tax to $ 6,500 if your withholding was $ 5,000 the amount you owed last year than you 'll owe the difference $ 1,500 but you wo n't have to pay any penalties if you normally get a refund every year even a small one then you should be fine i 'd check the numbers to be sure of course if you normally have to pay something every april 15 or if your income and therefore your withholding went down this year for whatever reason then you should make an estimated payment the irs has a page explaining the rules in more detail

what decision are you trying to make   are you interested day trading stocks to make it rich or are you looking at your investment options and trying to decide between an actively managed mutual fund and an etf if the former then precise statistics are hard to come by but i believe that 99 of day traders would do better investing in an etf if the latter then there are lots of studies that show that most actively managed funds do worse than index funds so with most actively managed funds you are paying higher fees for worse performance   here is a quote from the bogleheads guide to investing index funds outperform approximately 80 percent of all actively    managed funds over long periods of time they do so for one simple    reason rock bottom costs in a random market we do n't know what    future returns will be however we do know that an investor who keeps    his or her costs low will earn a higher return than one who does not    that 's the 's edge many people believe that your best option for investing is a diverse portfolio of etfs like this   this is what i do

document how you came to have the stuff in the first place first to defend against potential government inquiry and second to establish that you held the asset more than one year so you qualify for long term capital gains rate   i would n't sell it privately all at once if you can avoid it    if you can prove you held it more than a year   you should pay the long term capital gains tax rate which is fairly low   you 'll keep most of it   a huge windfall often goes very badly people do n't change their financial habits burn through their winnings shockingly fast overspend it and wind up deep in debt   at the end of the crazy train their lives end up worse    that was n't your question but you 'll do better if you 're on guard for that with good planning and a desire to invest it in things which give you deferred income in the future that 's the cooler thing when your investments mean you do n't have to go to work i do n't mean donate all of it to charity but feel free   if you hold a security more than one year and donate it to charity you get a tax deduction for the appreciated value even though the security did n't actually cost you that link do not convert the btc to cash then donate the cash donate it as btc   your tax deduction works against your highest tax bracket   if you are paying in a 28 tax bracket your next $ 100 of income has $ 28 tax then for every $ 100 of charitable donation you get $ 28 back on federal it does the same to state tax and you also avoid the 10 15 capital gains tax because you did n't sell the securities   do your 1040 both ways and note the difference your charitable deduction of appreciated securities is capped at 30 of agi   any excess will carryover and becomes a tax deduction for the next year and it can carryover for several years   use a donor advised fund if you have are donating more than $ 5000 you do n't need to search for a charity that will take bitcoin and you also do n't need to pick a charity now   instead open a special type of giving account called a donor advised fund   the daf itself is a charity it specializes in accepting complex donations and liquidating them into cash   the cash credits to your giving account   you take the tax deduction in the year you give to the daf   then when you want to give to a charity you tell the daf to donate on your    you can tell them to give on your behalf anonymously or merely conceal your address so you do n't get the endless charity junk mail    the daf lets you hold the money in index funds so your charity nest egg can grow with the market   mine has more than doubled thanks to the market   this money is no longer yours at this point you ca n't give it back to yourself only to licensed charities the fidelity donor advised fund makes a big thing of taking bitcoin and i really like them i love my daf and it has been a charitable giving   it turns you into a philanthropist and that changes you life in ways i can not describe certainly makes me more level headed about money    lottery winner syndrome is just not a risk for me partly because i 'm now on the board of charities and oversee an endowment   donating generally will reduce suspicion criminals do n't do that but donating to a daf even moreso   since the daf would have to return ill gotten gains they 're involved   their lawyers will back you up   the prosecutor is up against a billion dollar corporation instead of just you   with fidelity particularly bitcoin is a crusade for them and their lawyers know how to defend bitcoin   a fidelity daf is a good play for that reason alone imo   the gory details presumably you are donating to regular charities or a donor advised fund and these are 50 limit organizations since it 's capital gains you have a 30 limit if your donation is more than 30 of agi or if you have carryover from last year you use worksheet 2 in publication you plug your donations into line 4 then the worksheet grinds through all the math and shows what part you deduct this year and what part you carryover to the next year   i specifically asked managers at two whether they were ok with someone donating a complex asset to the daf and immediately giving the entire cash amount to a charity   the daf does n't get any fees if you do that   they said not only are they ok with it most of their donors do exactly that and most daf accounts are empty   they make it on the 0.6 a year custodial fee on the other accounts and charitable giving to them     mind you you can only donate to type charities what irs calls 50 limit organizations   this actually protects you from donating to organizations who lie about their status   i 'm not with fidelity but i am a satisfied daf customer   the daf funds its overhead by deducting 0.6 per year from your giving account if you invest the funds in a mutual fund within the daf that investment pays the 0.08 to 1.5 expense ratio of the fund    i can live with that   i just the value of donating $ 100 of appreciated security instead of taking it as capital gains income   28 fed tax 15 fed cap gains 8 state tax on both   take the $ 100 as income pay $ 23 in cap gains tax   donate $ 100 in securities the $ 23 tax goes away since you did n't sell it really   the $ 100 charitable deduction offsets $ 100 in income also saving you $ 36 in regular income tax   net tax savings $ 59   however you lost the $ 100   so you are net $ 41 poorer   it costs you $ 41 to donate $ 100 to charity   this gets better in higher brackets

climate scientists urgently need to explain why global warming has declined in recent years   i have a scientific background but this is not necessary to understand the relevance of this point   the nature of climate science means that the reverse should be true   man has not reduced the overall amount of co2 and other greenhouse gases therefore the climate should have continued to warm this is simple logic   what is worse for climate scientists is that the historical data suggests that climate is cyclical with much warmer periods apparent in pre industrial times   the inconvenience of this has led to climate scientists concentrating on the period from 1980 onwards the basis for this is that much more detailed information is available unfortunately the data for this period is showing the climate cooling rather than rising   man is doing tremendous damage to the environment in terms of pollution and fossil fuels are limited these are worrying have nothing to do with climate science   to believe in climate change is akin to believing in the tooth fairy to be a non believer is akin to being the little boy in the story of the emperor with no clothes   climate scientists are starting to run scared they have a theory but no evidence or even worse they have evidence that shows them to be wrong   they have built up a whole industry based on a fallacy now they are willing to tell any lie necessary to perpetuate it   this is not science

some lenders want to discourage the borrower from making these additional payments because they want to sell this as a service they might set this up for you or they have a contract with a 3rd party to set it up these services generally charge you to initiate the process and may have a recurring fee they take 1/2 a payment every 2 weeks then forward the money on the first of the month to the lender once a year they will send in the 13th monthly payment this gives them control of up to a months payment per account   there is no law that says they have to accept early payments so check the documents to make sure it is allowed for that mortgage then send in a test payment directing that the excess funds go to pay down principal verify online that the extra funds were credited correctly even it works once the borrower will have to keep checking to make sure it is handled correctly each month

i 've read multiple times that the way to rebuild the credit score is to get a credit card and then have some minor charges on it every month and have them paid in full every month old negative events age and this disciplined activity rebuild the score to some not to horrible levels now it 's true that it 's hard to get reasonably good credit cards when your credit score is poor yet it 's not necessary to have a good credit card for this case such things as large credit limit are not needed all that 's needed is a long grace period so that there 's no interest between the moment a charge is done and a moment the bill is paid in full at the end of the month yes the card may have rather high interest and rather low credit limit but it does n't really matter i 've read once on msn money that people are offered credit even while they 're in the middle of bankruptcy so it 's not impossible to get a credit card in the described situation goes without saying that a lot of discipline will be needed to have all this implemented

i am in complete agreement with you   the place i have found with the sort of charts you are looking for is    to compare the percentage increase of several stocks over a period of 2 market open days or more which is quite useful to follow the changes in various stocks etc an example   here the tickers are aa to otc and $ gold $ silver for the spot gold silver price that is n't really a ticker   it is set to show the last 6 market days one the 6 in   you can change it in the url above or change it on the site for the stocks you want up to 25 in one chart but it gets really hard to tell them apart   by moving the slider just left of the at the bottom right corner of the chart you can look at 2 days or more   for a specific time period in days highlight the and type any number of market open days you want 21 days = about one month etc   by setting a time period in days and moving the entire slider you can see how your stocks did in the last bull bear run as an example the site has a full how to for this and the other types of charts they offer the only problem is that many otc stocks are not charted save the comparison charts you use regularly in a folder in your browser bookmarks     i see the entire needed link is n't in blue but you need it all

here 's your problem the debt is valid and it is your debt regardless of your arrangement with the insurance company the insurance company possibly owes you money and you owe the doctor money you are stuck in the middle and in the end it does n't matter whether the insurance company pays as to whether you owe the money do n't ignore them also disputing the debt it pointless because the truth is that you do owe the debt the insurance company may owe you money which is in dispute but the debt to your medical provider is your own you are just stuck in the middle it sucks but is pretty common i think the best you can do is keep working on the insurance company and responding to the bill collectors letting them know that you are working on it and will need to pay late in theory they deal with this a lot and probably understand not that it will make them lay off you in the meantime   in the end it is possible you might have to sue the insurance company to get the money one thing to be careful about if the debt is fairly old several years you may want to avoid making partial payments because if this goes on your credit report that payment may extend the period where the negative information can appear on your credit history

you can apply for a position with any company you like whether or not you are a shareholder however owning shares in a company even lots of shares in a company does not entitle you to having them even look at your resume for any job let alone the ceo position you generally can not buy your way into a job   the hiring team if they are doing their job correctly will only hire you if you are qualified for the job not based on what your investments are stockholders get a vote at the shareholders meeting and a portion of the profits dividend and that 's about it   they usually do n't even get a discount on products let alone a job of course if you own a significant percentage of the stock you can influence the selections to the board of directors   with enough friends on the board you could theoretically get yourself in the ceo position that way

the reason banks charge fees for wires is because the federal reserve charges banks to send the wires   the fed charges the banks a hefty fee so the banks have to charge you a hefty fee to make up for it any time any business gives you a service for free its because they think they can make more money off of some other service or product they are selling you   so the question becomes how can i make myself valuable enough to a bank that they will waive my wire fees the account you linked to is a good example of this the monthly service charge along with the $ 0.50 charge every time you use your debit card would make up for the number of wires most people send

first you need to figure out what your objectives for the money are   mostly this boils down to how soon you are going to need the money   if you are as you say very busy and you do n't need the money until retirement i 'd suggest putting your money in a single target date fund such as the blackrock fund   you figure out when you are going to retire and put your money in that fund   the fund will then pick a mix of stocks bonds and other investments adjusting the risk for your time horizon maybe your objectives are different and you want to become an trader   you value being able to say at a bbq oh i bought aapl at $ 20 or i think small caps are over valued   i 'd suggest you take your $ 50,000 and structure it so you invest $ 5,000 a year over 10 years   nothing teaches you about investing like making or losing a bit of money in the market   if you put it all in at once you risk losing it all well before you 've learned many valuable lessons which only the market can teach you i 'd suggest you study the efficient market hypothesis before studying specific markets or strategies

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

tldr   you will probably need to move to a different employer to get the raise you want need deserve some employers in the us punish longevity through a number of practices   my wife worked as a nurse for about 20 years   during that time she had many employers leveraging raises with job changes   she quit nursing about 6 years ago and was being paid $ at the time   she had a friend that worked in the same system for 18 years   they had the same position in the same hospital that friend 's current rate of pay   $   you probably do n't want to be that person given your stack overflow participation i would assume you are some type of web developer   i would recommend updating your resume and moving for a 20 increase or more   you 'll get it as it is a great time to be a web developer   spending on it tends to go in cycles and right now budgets are very healthy for hiring new talent    while your current company might not have enough money in the budget to give you a raise they would not hesitate hiring someone with your skills at 95 k if they had an opening   its common but frustrating to all that are involved except the bean counters that looks at people like us as commodities    think about this   both sides of the table agree that you deserve a 5 k raise   but lets say next year only 3k is in the budget    so you are out the 5k you should have been given this year plus the 2k that you wo n't get plus whatever raise was fair for you next year   that is a lot of money   time to go do n't bother on holding onto any illusions of a counter offer by your current employer   there will be too much resentment   shake the dust off your feet and move on     edit some naysayers will cite short work histories as problems for future employment   it could happen in a small number of shops but short work histories are common in technology that recruiters rarely bat an eye   if they do as with any objection it is up to you to sell yourself   in cracking the code interview the author cites that no one is really expecting you to stay beyond 5 years    something like this would work just fine   i left acme because there were indications of poor financial health   given the hot market at the time i was able to find a new position without the worry of pending layoffs   if you are a contractor six month assignments are the norm   also many technology resumes have overlapping assignments   its what happens when someone is in demand

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

if you had a cc issuer that allowed you to do bill pay this way i suspect the payment would be considered a cash advance that will trigger a fee and a pretty egregious cash advance specific interest rate   it 's not normal for a credit payment portal to accept a credit card as payment if you were able to do this as a balance transfer again there would be fees to transfer the balance and you would not earn any rewards from the transferred balance   i think it 's important to note that cash back benefits are effectively paid by merchant fees   you make a $ 100 charge the merchant pays about $ 2.50 in transaction fee you 're credited with about $ 1 of cash back or points or whatever   absent a merchant transaction and the associated fee there 's no pot of money from which to apply cash back rewards

i 've been budgeting with ms money since 2004 and was pretty disappointed to hear it 's being discontinued budgeting is actually a stress hobby for me and i can be a bit of a control freak when it comes to finances so i decided to start early looking for a replacement rather than waiting until ms money can no longer download transactions here are the pros and cons of the ones i 've tried updated you need a budget pro ynab based on the old envelopes system ynab has you money from each paycheck to a specific budget category envelope it encourages you to live on last money 's income and if you have trouble with overspending that can be a great plan personally i 'm a big believer in the envelope concept so that 's the biggest pro i found also it 's a downloaded software so once i 've bought it for about $ 50 it 's mine without forced upgrades as far as i 've seen the big con for me was that it does not automatically download transactions i would have to sign on to each institution 's website and manually download to the program also coming from money i 'm used to having features that ynab does n't offer like the ability to store information about my accounts overall it 's forward thinking and a good budgeting system but will take some extra time to download transactions and is n't really a comprehensive management tool for all my financial needs you can try it out with their free trial mint this is a free online program the free part was a major pro it also looks pretty if that 's important to you updating is automatic once you 've got it all set up so that 's a pro mint 's budgeting tools are so so basically you choose a category and tell it your limit it at you by text or email when you cross the line but does n't seem to offer any other incentive to stay on budget   when i first looked at mint it did not connect with my credit union but it currently connects to all my banks and all but one of my student loan institutions   another recent improvement is that mint now allows you to manually add transactions including pending checks and cash transactions   the cons for me are that it does not give me a good end of the month report does n't allow me to enter details of my paychecks and does n't give me any cash flow forecasting overall mint is a good casual retrospective free online tool but does n't allow for much planning ahead mvelopes here 's another online option but this one is subscription based again we find the old envelopes system which i think is smart so that 's a pro for me it 's online so it downloads transactions automatically but also allows you to manually add transactions so another pro the big con on this one is the cost depending on how you far ahead you choose to pay quarterly yearly or you 're paying $ to $ 12 per month they do offer a free trial for 14 days plus another 14 days offered when you try to cancel another con is that they do n't provide meaningful reports overall a good concept but not worth the cost for me quicken i had n't tried quicken earlier because they do n't offer a free trial but after the last few fell short i landed with quicken 2009 pro for quicken as an ms money user is that it is remarkably similar in format and options the registers and reports are nearly identical one frustration i 'd had with money was that it was ridiculously slow at start up and after a year or so of entering data quicken is dragging con for quicken again as an ms money user is that it 's budgeting is not as detailed as i would like   also it does not download transactions smoothly now that my banks all ask security questions as part of sign in   i have to sign in to my bank 's website and manually download   quicken 2011 is out now but i have n't tried it yet   hopefully they 've solved the problem of security questions   quicken 2011 promises an improved cash flow forecast which sounds promising and was a feature of ms money that i have very much missed   have n't decided yet if it 's worth the $ 50 to upgrade to 2011

start as early as possible and you will want to kiss your younger self when you get to retirement age i know you and everyone else at that age thinks that they do n't make enough to start saving and leans towards waiting until you get established in your career and start making better money do n't put it off save some money out of each paycheck even if it is only $ 50   trust me as little as you make now you probably have more disposable income than you will when you make twice as much your lifestyle always seems to keep up with your income and you will likely always feel like you do n't have money left over to save the longer you wait the more you are going to have to stuff away to make up for that lost time you could have been compounding your returns as shown in this table assuming percent average gain annually which has been the average return on the stock market from 1926 2010   i also suggest reading this article when explains it in more detail who wants to be a millionaire

i have maintained that traditional tv will be obsolete for years now it seems a certain inevitability since the invention of the internet    even assuming it is certain there are some things to consider   1 time frame it is taking way longer than i had expected for people to switch away from traditional subscriptions packaging   many people refuse to adopt adapt to new technology and like the comfortable familiarity of tv it is hard to say exactly when the big shift will happen   2 the companies making billions of dollars are likely monitoring their revenues market very closely and will probably know better than you when their current business model is about to fail they may develop a plan to switch to internet based distribution production of shows or any number of other alternatives which might not cause their share price to drop as drastically as one might predict   profiting from this idea as with any strategy relies on you to identify the stocks that will be affected and time your short position on them better than the rest of the market doing it now or at an arbitrary date means you will incur the opportunity cost of holding the instrument over a period when another investment would yield better returns potentially even a long position on these same companies

i have had similar thoughts regarding alternative for the reasons you mention but for the most part they do n't exist   gold is often mentioned but outside of 1972 1974 when the us went off the gold standard it has n't been very effective in the diversification role   cash can help a little but it also fails to effectively protect you in a bear market as measured by portfolio drawdowns as well as std dev relative to gov't bonds there are alternative assets reverse etfs etc which can fulfill a specific short term defensive role in your portfolio but which can be very dangerous and are especially poor as a long term solution while some people claim to use them for effective results i have n't seen anything verifiable i do n't recommend them gov't bonds really do have a negative correlation to equities during periods in which equities underperform timing is often slightly delayed and that makes them more valuable than any other asset class as a   if you are concerned about rate increases avoid lt gov't bond funds   intermediate will work but will take a few hits short term bonds will be the safest   personally i 'm in 30 and willing to take the modest hit in exchange for the overall portfolio protection they provide against an equity downturn   if the hit concerns you tips may provide some long term help assuming inflation rises along with rates to some degree i personally think tips give up too much return when equity performance is strong but it 's a modest concern tips may suit you better than any other option   in general i 'm less concerned with a single asset class than with the long term performance of my total portfolio

here 's my crude reasoning let 's say you have just one recently acquired credit card with a $ 5000 limit the company that issued the credit card set the $ 5000 limit based on however they assessed your risk now if you 're using a significant portion of of the $ 5000 limit it means at least for them that you are stretching your wallet even if you 've been paying monthly consistently and since you are heavily using your limit it also means that if you lose your primary source of money for even one month income etc then your risk to the lender increases sharply had you been making more money compared to this $ 5000 limit then either you 'd have used less of your available credit or you would've gotten your limits raised by asking your bank to re evaluate your risk and increase the limit also your statement why is a us credit score based on credit utilization is slightly incorrect as per fico credit utilization has 35 weight while your payment history has a weight of 35 to sum it up we can debate if the weight for credit utilization should be higher or lower but unfortunately as others have pointed out these scores are meant to help lenders not consumers so whether we like it or not the secret algorithms to calculate the scores and the actual weights variables and rules they use are completely out of our hands

where did all this money come from   investing in a currency whether it 's bitcoin gold usd or another country 's currency is a risky investment because the average trader loses money after transaction fees this is not true of the stock market since successful companies actually produce wealth so in short money made from selling bitcoin comes from the people buying your bitcoins why has bitcoin performed so well over the past year this is an extremely difficult question to answer but i can point out some of the most prominent factors this last point is one of the biggest with all the recent hype more and more people want to try to get in on the action no one can tell when or if the bubble will pop though

i 've tried mint and i 've tried quicken now i think quicken is an annoying little piece of software but it is also quite capable overall i think it has the features you want you can enter your bills broken down by category in advance you can enter your paychecks broken down by category gross income federal income tax state income tax social security transfers to tax protected 401(k account etc in advance you can enter in your stock trades and it can tell you how much you 'll need to end up paying in capital gains taxes you can even enter in your stock option vesting schedule in advance it 's a royal pain because you ca n't go back and change anything without deleting everything but you can do it it 'll forecast your bank account balance in all of your bank accounts in advance with a shiny chart it 'll even model your loans if you set it up right i did n't do too much with the budgeting tools per se but the account balances daily features sound like the closest thing to what you 're looking for that 's likely to exist the only thing that 's a tricky is that transfers from one account to another may take multiple days hello ach and you 'll have to decide whether to record them at departure or arrival

for 3x it 's about 114 and for 4x 144 which naturally is twice 72   these are close back of napkin results with smart phone apps offering scientific calculators you should get comfortable just taking the root of a number for a more precise answer   update in response to brick 's comment the rule of 72 says that to double your money it answers both questions how much time do i need given a rate and how much return do i need given a time   logic tells me that if 72 is the number to double 144 is the but i 'm a math guy and my logic might not be logical to op so   let 's take the 20th root of 4    this is the key to use 4 hit key 20 equals the result is or and this is the precise rate you 'd need to quadruple your money in 20 years now 20 = which rounds to 144 rule of 144 to quadruple your money   this now answers op 's question how to derive a rule of x for a return other than doubling   one more example i want 10x my money of course i need the initial guess to enter one calculation people like 8 in general it 's a bit below the 10 long term s&p return and a good round number the rule of 72 says 9 years to double so 18 years is 4x and 36 years is for my initial calculation i 'll use 40 years the root of 10 i get again the precise rate that gives 10 fold over 40 years and multiplying this by 40 i get a rule of 237 which i 'm tempted to round to 240   at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = 9.99 at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = you can see that you lose some accuracy for the sake of a number that 's easier to remember and manipulate 72 to double is pretty darn accurate so i 'll stick with rule of 237 to get 10x my money    to close the purpose of these rules is to create the tool that lets you perform some otherwise tough calculations away from any electronic device of course i know how to use logs and in real life i 'm paid to explain them to students who are typically glad when that chapter is over i 've shown above how the rule of x can be formulated with a power root key which for most people is simpler ironically log calculations as offered force a continuous compounding which may not be desired at all it would give a result of 230 for my 10x return example and the following using the first equation he offered at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = which is further away from the desired 10x than my 237 or rounded 240

when considering such a major life decision with such high potential costs and high potential rewards i encourage you to consider multiple different potential options even if loans were available they might not be the best option less debt and an engineering degree is better than more debt and an engineering degree both of which are likely better than your current debt and no engineering degree i encourage you to consider revisit your aid which is not just loans cut expenses consider alternative aid sources use your engineering student status to get a better paying job including more profitable summer employment check for methods to cut down the cost of your degree and double check your plans to make sure you have a long term plan that makes sense   the first issue raised in the comments is whether or not you are getting appropriate financial aid this does not just mean loans it includes grants and other forms of assistance   you should be getting in state tuition and by searching the tuition of unc i believe you are but for future readers you should make sure you are getting in state rates and it not there are options to return to a state where you would get in state tuition rates or look into the possibility of your study for one year until you meet in state funding requirements you should also ensure your fafsa information is correct including your income family situation whether or not you are an independent study as it sounds like you probably are etc this effects how many grants you get and if you are independent this changes maximum federal loan amounts see website for details   while you do n't say what your pay is the fact that you are working two jobs and having trouble making ends meet suggests either that you have a spending issue or that your jobs pay sucks and possibly both i 've been in both situations and there are methods for dealing with both if your spending is not very carefully controlled that 's a big issue i wo n't try to rehash all the personal finance advice about this but i will just warn that when you are desperate and you know there is n't enough money even if you spend perfectly there is a strong tendency to just give up and not even try because what 's the point learned is hell but it can be overcome with effort and tightly holding on to any of hope you find to do better each day if you are in a field like engineering or computing and some other fields though i am less personally familiar with the current employment climate in those there are usually companies who want to hire you as a paid intern or part time employee in the hopes of getting you when you graduate those last two semesters of undergrad are a technicality to employers they know it does n't really change your skill set much many companies are actually more interesting in hiring someone on who has n't finished the degree yet than getting someone recently post degree because they can get you cheaper and learn if this is a good match before they have to take the big risk of full time hiring you need to use this system to your advantage its hard when you feel destitute but talk with career councilors in your school your department advisor and/or main administrative staff in your main academic department make sure you are on the right mailing lists to see the job offers many schools require you to subscribe to one because at a school like unc it easily gets way too much traffic each day you need field relevant experience not just to finish the degree but to be able to really open up your job opportunities and earning potential do not be shy about directly calling emailing a contact who reaches out to your school looking for recent graduates and especially any mention of flexibility on early start for those who are almost finished you can say you are in your final year you are and even ask if they are open to working around a light school schedule while you finish up most can end up to be no but it does n't matter the recruiting contacts want to hire people so just reaching out early means you can follow up later once you get your degree and finances sorted out and you will have an even easier time getting that opportunity in technology and engineering the importance of summer internships can not be understated especially as you are now technically at the end of your degree in engineering and tech fields internships pay often very well do n't worry about it being the job of your dreams depending on your set of skills apply to insurance companies it departments in hospitals and banks even if you thought your coding skills in engineering were minimal and of course any paying position that might be more directly in your field of interest consider ones outside your immediate area or even the more national internships from the bigger name companies where possible it is not at all uncommon for tech and engineering internships for undergraduate students to pay $ + per hour even where most non degree jobs might only pay $ 8 and i 've seen as high as $ 40 per in the high cost of living markets depending on your skill set i know many people who were paid more as a student intern than they were previously paid as a full time professional employee many schools including unc charge different tuition for distance learning and satellite campuses and often also offer university approved online classes while this is not always a possibility for every student you should consider the options it could be that one of the final classes you need towards your degree can be taken at one of these other options with reduced tuition this is not always possible with all courses but is certainly true if you have any of those general education requirements to knock out also consider if any of those final requirements have test out options such as test alternatives again not always available but sometimes you can get class credit for a general education class for    finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money attend part time while working look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted inquire about scholarships and school emergency assistance while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options student loan forbearance while in school if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in skip a semester if necessary to save money if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet double check on credit expiration and degree requirements make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't inquire about other government and community based assistance being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you make sure your long term goal makes sense finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment

essentially yes peter lynch is talking about the peg ratio the price earnings to growth peg ratio is where you take the p e ratio and then divide that by the growth rate which should include any dividends   a lower number indicates that the stock is undervalued and could be a good buy lynch 's metric is the inverse of that growth rate divided by the p e ratio   it is the same idea but in this case a higher number indicates a good value for buying in either case the idea behind this ratio is that a fairly priced stock will have the p e ratio equal the growth rate   when your growth rate is larger than your p e ratio you are theoretically looking at an undervalued stock

i was wondering how do we calculate the total capital of a company which items should i look for in the financial statements total capital usually refers to the sum of long term debt and total shareholder equity both of these items can be found on the company 's balance sheet this is one of the calculations that 's traditionally used when determining a company 's return on capital   i 'll use the balance sheet from gilead sciences 2012 10-k form as an example net long term debt was $ and total stockholder equity was $ which should give a grand total of $ for total capital i know you can do the math but i always find an example helpful if it uses realistic numbers   you may sometimes hear the term total capital referring to total capital stock or total capital assets in which case it may be referring to physical capital i.e. assets like inventory etc instead of financial capital leverage and how do i calculate notes payable is the same as accounts payable as the word payable suggests both are liabilities however i 've always been taught that accounts payable are debts a business owes to its suppliers while notes payable are debts a business owes to banks and other institutions with which it has signed a formal agreement and which use formal debt instruments e.g. a loan contract this definition seems to match various articles i found online   on a balance sheet you can usually determine notes payable by combining the short term debt of the company with the current portion of the long term debt these pieces comprise the debt that is due within the fiscal year in the balance sheet for gilead sciences i would only include the $ categorized as current portion of long term debt and other obligations net term since the other current liabilities do n't look like they would involve formal debt contracts   since the notes payable section of 's balance sheet does n't seem that diverse and therefore might not make the best example i 'll include the most recent balance sheet monsanto as monsanto 's balance sheet lists a term called short term debt including current portion of long term debt with a value of $ 36 million this looks like almost the exact definition of notes payable 1 note that this financial statement is called a statement of consolidated financial position on monsanto 's

as dilip said if you want actual concrete based in tax law answers please add the country and if applicable state where you pay income tax also knowing what tax bracket you 're in would help as well although i certainly understand if you 're not comfortable sharing that so assuming the us if you 're in the 10 or 15 tax bracket then you 're already not paying any federal tax on the $ 3k long term gain so purposely taking losses is pointless and given that there 's probably a cost to taking the loss commission sec fee you 'd be losing money by doing so also you wo n't be able to buy back the loser for 31 days without having the loss postponed due to the wash sale that would result state tax is another matter but going by the table in this article even using the highest low end tax rate tennessee at 6 the $ 50 loss would only save you $ 3 which is probably less than the commission to sell the loser so again you 'd be losing money and if you 're in a state with no state income tax then the loss would n't save you anything on taxes at the state level but of course you 'll still be paying to be able to take the loss on the high end you 'd be saving 20 federal tax and state tax using the highest high end tax state california and ignoring because i do n't know whether they tax long term capital gains at the same rate as regular income or not you 'd be saving $ 50 20 + = $ 50 = $ so for taxes you 're looking at saving between nothing and $ and then you have to subtract from that the cost to achieve the loss so even on the high end which means assuming a single filer you 're making > $ 1 million you 're only saving about $ 10 and you 're probably actually losing money so i personally do n't think taking a $ 50 loss to try to decrease taxes makes sense however if you really meant $ 500 or $ 5000 then it might although if you 're in the 10 15 brackets in a no income tax state even then it would n't so the answer to your final question is it depends the only way to say for sure is based on the country and state you 're in calculate what it will save you if anything as a general rule you want to avoid letting the tax tail wag the dog that is your financial goal should be to end up with the most money not to pay the least taxes so while looking at the tax consequences of a transaction is a good idea do n't look at just the tax consequences look at the consequences for your overall net worth

a 401 k pre tax or roth account or an ira deductible or roth account is a retirement account which means you delay paying taxes now on your deposits or you avoid paying taxes on your earnings later   but a retirement account does n't   perform any different than any other account year to year being a retirement account does n't   dictate a type of investment you can invest in a certificate of deposit that is guaranteed to make x% this year or you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds that in stocks or bonds those stocks and bonds can be growth focused or income focused they can be from large companies or small companies us companies or international companies or whatever mix you want the graph in your question shows that if you invest early in your adulthood and keep investing and you make the average return you should make more money than starting later but a couple of notes   so to your exact questions an s&p 500 investment should perform exactly the same this year if it is in a 401 k ira or taxable account with a few exceptions   yes any investment can lose money the last 6 months have been volatile and the last month and a half especially so a retirement account is n't any different an investment in mutual fund x in a retirement account is just as depressed a one in the same fund but from a taxable account

with no written agreement in place the right rate is whatever both parties can agree to i could argue that i could have invested the money in s&p 500 index funds and made about 9 annually over the last 15 years and the 15,000 would have been over 40,000   the fair rate would be whatever rate of return could have been expected from whatever your father would have done with the money otherwise keep it in a bank account pay off debt invest in the market start a business whatever   your father has the benefit of hindsight to know what would have been a good use of the funds over 15 years using the rate of inflation results in effectively a zero percent loan in real interest terms meaning no profit was made just accounting for the time value of money both parties need to either decide on an amount or equivalent rate or decide if squeezing the other for a few thousand euros is worth the strife

i am not trying to attribute the current economic climate and the decisions that stem from that with raising tax rates   i simply think that a higher tax rate for the wealthy will further slow the recovery i also think that the issue of tax rates is being used to divert the attention of the people from that which is actually killing us the national debt that is thanks to trillion dollar deficits the tax hikes are used to a fight between red and blue without getting to the crux of the matter    the reality is that at most the government might be able to raise taxes that would generate 200 or 300 billion dollars more in yearly revenue over the short term over the long term these taxes will drive capital off shore and into investments that shelter it from taxes at the same time that the debt continues to increase at over 1 trillion per year anyway   the debate should be this do we want to cut federal spending by 40 now or do we want to cause an economic and monetary collapse by continuing along with deficits that are 10 of gdp

the key two things to consider when looking at similar identical etfs is the typical or indicative spread and the trading volume and size of the etf just like regular stocks thinly traded etf 's often have quite large spreads between buy and sell in the 1.5 range in some cases this is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants aps face issues in general with stock etfs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue as the creation redemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust it 's consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor on point 3 no this would create an arbitrage which an authorized participant would quickly take advantage of worth reading up about the creation and redemption mechanism here is a good place to start to understand the exact way this happens in etfs as it 's very key to how they work

when he wrote this i think there may have been greater between workers workers were perfectly competitive if you will    i find that there is huge wage growth in certain industries and with certain skills this only impacts a limited number of people with the majority of workers in fields that are not heavily valued    another avenue would be to look at the real wage if wages are going up only 1 2 but inflation was at negative 3 4 then those workers wages were increasing at 4 6    i am not sure the gig economy is to blame the gig economy would suggest that we are nowhere near full employment how can people have time to have these gigs if they were gainfully employed already    another scenario is that we are not near full employment at all that you have a large number of people who are part time their income with other jobs to make ends meet    and i am sure that were milton friedman alive today he would change his assumption to match reality i wonder what wisdom he would have for us today

the big difference is that you get your money earlier at the start suppose you start on a random day with payday on the last day of the month monthly or on every 2nd wednesday biweekly and it takes 3 days for payroll to ramp up ie if payday is within 3 days on your start date your next paycheck is not on the next payday but on the one after if we assume every month has 30 days to keep things simple it is an average of 4 + days until you get your first paycheck with monthly pay an average of days for weekly it is a bit trickier assuming you get hired at a random date here with being a time until you get paid an average of 10.5 days so you get your first pay an average of 8 days earlier later on that 3 day thing no longer occurs and now the company holds an average of 6.5 days of your pay due to you with biweekly paychecks and about 14.5 days with weekly paychecks if you have monthly pay so with monthly pay on average your bank account has 8 fewer days of   your pay in it at all times   this happens when   you are first hired and persists over the length of your employment now suppose you save that extra money on average suppose you have an investment at 4 after inflation   over 40 years those 8 days of pay invested at 4 grow to 38 days of pay a free month what more if the company has problems making payroll you 'll get a warning to say look for another job an average of 8 days sooner and/or have the money in your account   having someone owe you money is usually worse than having the money in your bank account

not as you suggest since you are sole prop you are taxed on a cash basis within reason you can prepay vendors so temp to hire through an agency might appear more attractive than direct hire but there needs to be a justification other than avoidance of taxes so pre paying 100k on would look fishy as fuck plus your quality of candidate will suffer if you need anything other than low skill labor   look at your other fully deductible expenses anything you can prepay prepay for example i set my liability insurance renewal january 15 to provide optionality but it just shifts one year into another means if you are in the same marginal bracket next year   the irs has also relaxed depreciation on office technology computers are now fully deductible rather than being capitalized   500k revenue you should have a cpa and legal counsel simply incorporating is n't tax magic the purpose is to limit liability not a tax shelter but shitty things happen once you have employees do n't create the potential for a disgruntled employee lawsuit put your shelter at risk of court judgment   that said assuming you are n't dumping a hypothetical on the internet congrats for all the headaches having employees is the ultimate leverage it 's like a xerox machine for your labor including loss of fidelity with each copy

there is some merit to it in that federal gross receipts are largely uncorrelated with tax wp content federal personal income tax rates tax    there are two somewhat perverse consequences of that fact first raising taxes does n't raise revenues meaning we ca n't actually pay for free stuff from uncle sam merely by adding an offsetting tax increase   and second raising taxes on group x ie the rich to make them pay their fair share flat out does n't work it 's effectively just kicking them in the balls because we grudge them for having more money than we do   now as to whether or not lowering taxes really encourages companies to hire more and pay better that 's an entirely separate issue from whether or not it 's revenue neutral from the perspective of the federal government   fortunately we have a recent historical example reagan did exactly that which in a period of corporate greed and erosion of workers rights not seen since the end of the days of the robber barons   so on the front end trump 's not wrong on the back end he 's trying to sell us unicorn

i am interested in seeing what happens to your report after you test this but i do n't think it 's possible in practice would not affect your credit score and also would n't be worth it for you to carry a negative balance like that having a -1 credit utilization essentially means that you are lending the credit card company money which is n't really something that the credit card companies do they would likely not accept an agreement where you are providing the credit to them having credit is a more formal agreement than just i paid you too much this month even if your payment does post before the transaction and it says you have a negative balance and gets reported to the credit bureau like that this would probably get flagged for human review and a negative credit utilization does n't really reflect what is happening credit utilization is how much do you owe amount of credit available to you and it 's not really correct to say that you owe negative dollars carrying a negative balance like that is money that could be invested elsewhere my guess is that the credit card company is not paying you the apr of your card on the amount they owe you if they are please provide the name of your card they probably do n't pay you anything for that negative balance and it 's money that 's better used elsewhere even if it does benefit your credit score you 're losing out on any interest each month you could have earned with that money to get maybe 1 2 better rate on your next home or car loan when will that be   tldr i think credit utilization approaches a limit at 0 because it 's based on the amount you owe and you do n't really owe negative dollars i am very interested in seeing the results of this experiment please update us when you find out

short answer yes for federal income tax purposes you are taxed on your total income adding up positives and negatives if business a made say $ 100,000 while business b lost $ 20,000 then your total income is $ 80,000 and that 's what you 'll be taxed on as @littleadv says of course any business losses you claim must qualify as business losses under irs rules and yes there are special rules about losses that the irs considers passive if you have wage income in addition to business income business losses do n't offset wage income for social security and medicare tax purposes you ca n't get a refund of the social security tax deducted from your paycheck i do n't know if this is relevant to you but if you have businesses in different states each is taxed by that state for example i have two tiny side businesses one in michigan and one in ohio last year the michigan business made money while the ohio business lost money so my federal income was michigan minus ohio my ohio income was negative so i owed no ohio income tax but i could n't subtract my ohio losses from my michigan income for michigan income tax purposes thus having say $ 10,000 income in michigan and $ 10,000 in ohio would result in lower taxes than $ 30,000 income in michigan and a $ 10,000 loss in ohio even though the total income in both cases is the same and this would be true even if the tax rates in both states were identical

they do n't make any money off of you personally they make money off of the merchants per transaction when you use the card   you trigger this fee to the credit card issuer but it does n't come out of your pocket   or it should n't merchants are n't allowed to pass this fee on to you they keep you around because you may at some point become less responsible than you already are and it would be quite costly to get you back a couple hundred dollars is the cost of acquiring a new credit card customer people who are less responsible than you subsidize your free float and your rewards if any but the new card act makes it more difficult for people to use their cards irresponsibly so these perks that you enjoy will get less with time

your house and 25 acres was $ 50 k how is that even possible growing up in the 90 's the average house in my town was around $ 600k now median home prices in that area are around $ 1 million this is a suburb of boston so it 's not like i 'm talking about a place in an actual city   prices fluctuate in real estate so much depending on location growing up in massachusetts and then doing my undergrad near nyc my experience with average or entry level home prices told me they were always over half a million it did n't really hit me that prices varied significantly until i went to get my masters from syracuse my friend 's father decided to just buy a 5 bedroom house on the edge of campus rather than pay her rent it was so cheap it made sense a little under $ 100 k so he bought it with straight cash    but still 25 acres and $ 50k sounds today like the cost of building materials alone would be more than that forgetting about the cost of land

the answer depends on the specific instrument to which you are referring it is possible to make straight bets that are cash settled and in which the underlying commodity or instrument will never be bought or sold   it is also possible to have such a contract be settled in the underlying if the cash value is appropriate then the cash settlement can be used to purchase the underlying directly if necessary   physical delivery was predominant until the last few decades   most traders as opposed to or are going to prefer cash settled contracts as opposed to physical delivery it is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet   the firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market   the cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite matching bet in this way brokers are following market price while traders are setting it financially options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying and they can be made directly with the opposite or with a neutral dealer

the existing account that her employer set up is probably not a spousal rrsp so for you to contribute your money to her rrsp you 'd have to create a new account somewhere could be with the same financial institution or somewhere else but if you 've got a joint bank account the distinction between your money and her money becomes blurred you 're basically allowed to say the $ 10000 is her money as long as you can trace the funds back to amounts that she added her so in that case you could just use her existing rrsp if you want to there may be other reasons to consider an alternate account such as having more flexibility or lower costs for investing your contributions often the plans that employers offer have only a small selection of mutual funds with medium to high mer costs since you 're planning to withdraw for the hbp soon this probably does n't matter that much yet but as you start re contributing to replace what you took out that money will probably not get touched until retirement and therefore you would want to invest it more efficiently for that i recommend you take a look at the model portfolios at canadian couch potato as tangerine td e series or buying etfs through a discount broker are usually the lowest cost methods of growing your retirement portfolio

nobody here really answered your question   the custodian of the 401k determines what funds and investment options are available within that 401k   so if they 're eliminating company stock as an option then they can absolutely make you sell out of it     you may be able to do an in service rollover and transfer your funds to an individual ira but that 's not particularly common among 401k administrators    aside from that i 'd ask why do you want to hold company stock anyway   generally i 'd advise against this as its imposing a ton of risk on your financial future   if your company tanks you 're out of a job which sucks   but it sucks even more if your company tanks and your 401k loses a ton of value at the same time    edit i see you asked who benefits as well   it may just be a situation of no benefit at all   perhaps the plan did n't have enough people investing in company stock to make the option cost effective   maybe the administrator decided that allowing people to take on that amount of risk was not in their best 's not   could be a ton of reasons but it 's unlikely the company did so out of greed   there is n't a lot of financial benefit for them there

i would like to establish credit history have heard it 's useful to    gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords that 's true as to employment they do background checks which means that they usually wo n't like bad things but wo n't care about the good things or no things they 'll know you 're a foreigner anyway is it safe to assume that this implies i have no history whatsoever probably but you can verify pulling through do n't go around giving your personal information everywhere is taking out a secured loan the only way for me no but it 's one of the easiest better would be getting a secured credit card not loan for loan you 'll have to pay interest for a credit card assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately you will only pay the credit card fees for secured credit cards they charge 100 yearly fees so do shop around the prices vary a lot if you 're using it wisely after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest which is actually very competitive last i heard it was around 2 twice as much as the online savings accounts as to a secured loan you 'll be paying 4 to cu for your own money does n't make any sense at all for me for credit cards you 'll at least get some value for your money convenience additional fraud protection etc the end result will be the same usually the credit starts to build up after ~6 12 months that 's why after a year your secured cc will be converted to a regular one make sure to have the statement balance in the range of 10 30 of your credit limit to get the best results would it make much better sense to wait till i get a job then i would    have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular cc directly you can apply but you 'll probably be rejected as i mentioned in another answer elsewhere the system in the us is such that you 're unable to get credit if you do n't already have credit which is kindof a magic circle which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution

the details of how you can convert your 5 equity share to cash or stocks will be detailed in writing in the legal agreement you have already signed if you do not have any signed written agreement there is no 5 since 0 of anything is zero you can expect to get $ 0 some time within the next few years lastly if the person running the business tells you that there is 5 equity for you even though it is not in writing that is extremely unlikely to be the case this is because the seller of the equity has no obligation whatsoever to pay you in fact they are obligated by their other agreements with actual shareholders not to dilute their equity without good cause so odds are if your agreement is not in writing not only will it not be honored but it probably ca n't be honored

it is very likely that the fund paid out a dividend in the form of reinvested shares   this happens with many funds especially as we come to the end of the year here 's a simplified example of how it works   assume you invested $ 1000 and bought 100 units at $   ignoring the daily price fluctuations if the fund paid out a 20 dividend you would get $ 200 and the unit price would drop to $   assuming you chose to reinvest your dividends you would automatically purchase another $ 200 worth of units at the new price so 25 more units   you would now have 125 units $ = $ 1000 invested in your example notice that you now have more shares than you originally purchased but that the price dropped significantly   your market value is above what you originally invested so there was probably also a bit of a price increase for the day   you should see the dividend transaction listed somewhere in your account just to confirm i did a quick search on and found that they did indeed pay a dividend yesterday

i fell into a similar situation as you   i spent a lot of time trying to understand this and the instructions leave a lot to be desired   what follows is my ultimate decisions and my rationale   my taxes have already been filed so i will let you know if i get audited 1   so in cases like this i try to understand the intent   in this case section iii is trying to understand if pre tax money was added to your hsa that you were not entitled too   as you describe this does not apply to you   i would think you should be ok not including section iii i did n't however i am not a tax lawyer or even a lawyer    2 i do not believe these are medical distributions from the 8889 doc    qualified hsa distribution    this is a distribution from a health flexible spending arrangement fsa or health reimbursement arrangement that is contributed by your employer directly to your hsa this is a one time distribution from any of these arrangements the distribution is treated as a rollover contribution to the hsa and is subject to the testing period rules shown below see pub 969 for more information    so i do n't think you have anything to report here    3 as you have no excess this line can just be zero    4 from the 8889 doc this is a distribution from your traditional ira or roth ira to your hsa in a direct trustee to trustee transfer    again i do n't think this applies to you so you can enter zero 5 this one is the easiest   you can always get this money tax free if you use it for qualified medical expenses from the 8889    distributions from an hsa used exclusively to pay qualified medical expenses of the account beneficiary spouse or dependents are from gross income see the line 15 instructions for information on medical expenses of dependents not claimed on your return you can receive distributions from an hsa even if you are not currently eligible to have contributions made to the hsa however any part of a distribution not used to pay qualified medical expenses is includible in gross income and is subject to an additional 20 tax unless an exception applies    i hope this helps

there is no difference between more shares of a relatively cheaper stock and less shares of a relatively more expensive stock when you invest in a stock the percentage increase or decrease in the share price results in gains or losses this is a fundamental concept of investing your question suggests that you would benefit from further research before investing your money trading real dollars can be difficult without a strong understanding of the principles involved investing your money without a good knowledge base will likely be stressful and could have a discouraging effect if it does n't go well before you open an investment account read up on investing fundamentals particularly mutual funds as those can be a great place to start as a new investor there are many sources of information including books websites such as and this website do n't skip the sections on taxes as those matter just as much and sometimes more than the simple buying and selling you might look at tax advantaged accounts such as 401k 's ira 's etc   it should n't take long but it will be one of the most important things you do as a beginning investor everyone has to start here understanding the vocabulary and concepts will likely save you time and money throughout your investing life

something very similar to this was extremely popular in the uk in the late 1980s   the practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s   reading up on the uk endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form   the basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy   many endowment policies were simply index tracking and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage and may well have extra left over in the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity

the only advantage of changing all your money now to the new currency is that you might get a better conversion rate now than later so you get more of the new currency and you may pay a lower percentage fee for changing a larger sum of money however regarding the better conversion rate you will not know this except with hindsight the disadvantage of changing all at once is that if you have changed too much and need to change back to your own currency or a third currency you will be charged fees and lose on the conversion rate twice if you know how long you are going to be in the new country say 12 months maybe start by converting an amount you think you will be spending in a month if you spend more then you can change a bit more the next month or if you spend less change less the next month if you find you are spending similar amounts for the next month or so then you can budget on the amount you may be spending for the remainder of your stay and then convert this amount over if you have a little left over at the end of your stay maybe reward yourself with something or buy a present for someone special back at home if you need a little more just convert this amount in the last month or so

you should dispute the transaction with the credit card describe the story and attach the cash payment receipt and dispute it as a duplicate charge there will be no impact on your score but if you do n't have the cash receipt or any other proof of the alternative payment it 's your word against the merchant and he has proof that you actually used your card there so worst case you just paid twice if you dispute the charge and it is accepted the merchant will pay a penalty if it is not accepted you may pay the penalty on top of the original charge depending on your credit card issuer some charge for frivolous charge backs it will take several more years for either the european merchants to learn how to deal with the us half baked chip cards or the american banks to start issue proper chip and pin card as everywhere else either way until then if the merchant does n't know how to handle signatures with the american credit cards just do n't use them pay cash given the controversy in the comments my intention was not to say no do n't talk to the merchant from the description of the situation it did n't strike me as the merchant would even bother to consider the situation a less than honest merchant knows that you have no leverage and since you 're a tourist and will probably not be returning there anyway what 's the worst you can do to them a bad yelp review you can definitely get in touch with the merchant and ask for a refund but i would not expect much to come out from that

if you want to spend all of your money in the next few years then a cd protects you from the risk of a bear market however if your time horizon is longer than 10 years then the stock market is a better bet since it is less effected by inflation risk also as you point out average stock returns are much higher ignoring volatility   on the whole cd 's appeal to people who would otherwise save their money in cash   generally it seems these people are simply afraid of stocks and bonds because those securities can lose nominal value as well as real value   i suspect this is largely because these people do n't understand inflation nor the historical long term index fund performance

the old underwriting standards were 28 home debt to income ratio and 33 consumer debt to income ratio consumer debt is calculated based on minimum payments now most models are revised upwards i believe is more common today   as long as you are current on the accounts closing credit or store revolving accounts will have little or no bearing just leave them dormant there is no positive result from closing accounts that have no balance having low or no balances has no negative impact on your credit score low balances are not red flags to lenders period here 's a quote from fair it 's just not true that you can have too much available credit that by itself is never a negative with the score sometimes the things you do to get too much can be a problem such as opening a bunch of new accounts but for the most part that 's just kind of an old wives tale the major drivers of credit scoring are to improve your prospects for getting a mortgage you should be reducing your spending and focusing 60/40 on saving for a down payment and paying down that $ 15k credit card respectively having cash for a down payment is critical to your buying power as zero down loans are n't widely available in 2011 and a large downpayment will allow you to eliminate or reduce the time you are paying pmi pmi reduces your buying power and is a big waste of money

there is not necessarily a need to prevent what you describe turning insurance on before high risk situations they just need to calculate the premiums accordingly for example if an insurance needs to take for insuring your house against flood and a flood happens in average every 10 years if you just insure the two weeks in the ten years where heavy rain is predicted you might pay 500 $ for the two weeks the total is the same for the insurance they get 500 $ and you get insurance for the dangerous period in the contrary if a flooding unexpectedly happens outside your two weeks they are out from the home owners view 500 $ for two weeks when heavy rains and floods are expected and nothing otherwise sounds pretty good compared to 50 $ every year it is the same of course but psychology works that way

you may look into covered calls   in short selling the option instead of buying it playing the house    one can do this on the buying side too e.g. let 's say you like company xyz   if you sell the put and it goes up you make money   if xyz goes down by expiration you still made the money on the put and now own the stock the one you like at a lower price   now you can immediately sell calls on xyz   if it does n't go up you make money   if it does goes up you get called out and you make even more money probably selling the call a little above current price or where it was put to you at the greatest risk is very large declines and so one needs to do some research on the company to see if they are decent e.g. have good earnings not over valued p e etc   for larger declines one has to sell the call further out   note there are now stocks that have weekly options as well as monthly options   you just have to calculate the rate of return you will get realizing that underneath the first put you need enough money available should the stock be put to you    an additional associated strategy is starting by selling the put at a higher than current market limit price   then over a couple days generally lowering the limit if it is n't reached in the stock 's fluctuation   i.e. if the stock drops in the next few days you might sell the put on a dip    same deal if the stock finally is put to you   then you can start by selling the call at a higher limit price gradually bringing it down if you are n't successful i.e. the stock does n't reach it on an upswing my friend is highly successful with this strategy good luck

you can think of a free cash flow as dividends from operations fcf = cash from operations investment in operations the present value of these cash flows into the future is the value of the firm dcf is very much like the dividend discount model    now why does a dcf produce enterprise value and not equity value because a dcf values the firm 's operating assets to find the equity value you use the accounting relation assets = liabilities + equity or in financial terms net operating assets = net financial obligations + common stockholders equity this means you take away net debt from the value produced by the dcf to find equity   now all your excess cash is netted off against your financial obligations debt to find the net debt cash used for day to day operations is an operating asset and should be treated as such operating cash should not deducted from value of assets when finding the value of equity   at least that 's what they 're teaching at university now i 'm a uni student who 's just finished my business valuation subject

the first step i would do is determine the asset class mixture for your current portfolio and the mixture for your new one if they are the same and all you are doing is changing the funds that you use to invest in that mixture of asset class then just do the change all at once in this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes   if you are also changing your asset class mixture then it depends on how large the change is i would still do the whole change at once but if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps i would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix

this might not be the answer you are looking for but the alternative to do n't patronize these merchants is this do patronize these merchants and pay cash    credit cards are convenient   i use a credit card often   however there is no denying that they cost the merchants an incredible amount in fees and that our entire economy is paying for these fees   the price of everything is more than it needs to be because of these fees   yes you get some money back with your rewards card but the money you get back comes directly from the store you made the purchase with and the reward is paid for by increasing the price of everything you buy   in addition those among us that do not have the credit score necessary to obtain a rewards card are paying the same higher price for goods as the rest of us but do n't get the cash back reward honestly it seems quite fair to me that only the people charging purchases to a credit card should have to pay the extra fee that goes along with that payment processing   if a store chooses to do that i pay cash instead and i am grateful for the discount

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

the quiktrip business model is an interesting one i 'm looking forward to seeing its long term stability every business has to offer value to its customers and it needs to bring unique value in order to take off at quiktrip 's rate imo quiktrip 's value is their large footprint combined with clean organized stores carrying a wide variety of products    this value is only unique in comparison to the general of their primarily regional competition most convenience store chains are regional on a city by city basis and they generally do a poor job of ensuring consistency in the areas i listed for quiktrip that 's the general trend including good chains there are plenty of bad ones where you would have to be insane to try one of the or tube things that have sat on the for 3 months   the problem is that maintaining a convenience store is n't hard it requires competent management and employees who give a half ass effort quiktrip can afford to pay for excellent management and employees who give a whole ass effort because their geographic footprint affords another unique advantage how long will that remain unique i know of several equally decent growing chains that offer better prices and if the market is large enough we 're likely to see oil companies giving a shit about the convenience store side again like they did in the 90 's after the rise of 7 11    i 'm more than likely wrong somewhere in my analysis of quiktrip 's list of advantages however if i 'm on the right track i 'd be hesitant to call them a long term winner when they operate a high cost operation in a heavily price sensitive market

yes w4 determines how much your employer will withhold from your wages leaving everything at default would mean that your salary is your only taxable income and you only take default deductions your employee will calculate your tax withholding based on that but if your salary is > 200k i assume that you have other income investment capital gains interest on your bank account which you will have to pay taxes on you 're probably going to have some deductible expenses business partnership expenses mortgage interest donations college funds etc as well so it is very likely unless you 're really not smart about money that you have more to do with your taxes than just the employers withholding

index funds may invest either in index components directly or in other instruments like etfs index options futures etc which are highly correlated with the index the specific fund prospectus or description on any decent financial site should contain these details   index funds are not actively managed but that does not mean they are n't managed at all if index changes and the fund includes specific stock they would adjust the fund content of course the downside of it is that selling off large amounts of certain stock on its low point since it 's being excluded presumably because of its decline and buying large amount of different stock on its raising point may have certain costs which would cause the fund lag behind the index usually the difference is not overly large but it exists   investing in the index contents directly involves more transactions which the fund distributes between members so it does n't usually buy individually for each member but manages the portfolio in big chunks which saves costs of course the downside is that it can lag behind the index if it 's volatile also in order to buy specific shares you will have to shell out for a number of whole share prices which for a big index may be a substantial sum and wo n't allow you much flexibility like i want to withdraw half of my investment in s&p 500 since you ca n't usually own 1/10 of a share with index funds the entry price is usually quite low and increments in which you can add or withdraw funds are low too

wrong insurance companies also increase rates for smokers despite smokers actually costing less for medical treatment because they usually die of heart attack and stroke really early rather than be 90 years old with replaced knees 24 hour care and 30 different drugs per day

unfortunately when you deal with options you are going to have to accept some exposure to your greeks so in your example you could just buy back month atm calls although delta is going to be pretty static across your portfolio at least for say the first year depending on and other third order greeks which will keep your in check you 're still exposed to vega which will ultimately skew across the board    such are the caveats of options in order to obtain leverage you will need to take a less passive outlook but not by much

finance at the phd level requires a pretty complete understanding of linear algebra calc vector calc stochastic calc diff eq and numerical analysis   as someone who had math for one of his majors for undergrad it 's not about the intuitive understanding but the abstract as well   most of the finance professors that i had and researched under were originally undergrad for math   very few of them actually started out in business roles degrees

since you are trying to compare corporate bonds that have a defined coupon over the specified time of the bond why not use a simple net present value npv calculation refer net present value npv you could use the discounting factor as the current repo rate of your central bank as i said this would be a simple fast measure not considering risk rating of the bonds inflation and other considerations take a notional 1000 as in each instrument and calculate the npv higher it is better the investment another method in terms of percentage return would be internal rate of return irr though the a bit more complicated it would give you a percentage figure note the above 2 measures are used when the cashflow over the time period is known it will not work for instruments where the cashflow value over different time are not known like stocks

the mental approach should be that you always knew the risk of gambling and it was extra money that you had or should have had now think that the horse race is not over and in the near future it will pick up pace against the others and be back on track

i have several as well acquired the same way as you and i am happy with the idea   they are very stable and that is the reason they pay so little   i do n't think you can get a low risk and medium or high return   the interest does reset every six months so you do get a bit of the market should the fed set interest rates higher you bonds will eventually reflect that bonds and certificates of deposit are just one element of your investment portfolio   put the money you ca n't lose into bonds the money you can into higher risk stocks bonds are great from our grandparent 's perspective because they are not going to lose value my grandparents were depression era folks who wanted that stability   they are trivial to give as gifts   most other investment forms require a heavy bit more of legal work i would think

i think r personalfinance is where you want to be   that being said only do a monthly payment plan if its interest free which it likely is n't figure out what the total cost for both options will be and go for the cheaper

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

there are several areas of passive fraud by being unclear on what you are doing   when a citizen buys a house the mortgage lender wants all the details as to how the buyer rounded up the money   that is so they can use their own formulas to assess the buyer 's creditworthiness and the probability that the buyer will be able to keep up on payments taxes and maintenance or have they overextended themselves the fraud is in the withholding of that info by way of tricking them into making a favorable decision when they might not have if they 'd had all the facts   then there 's making this sound all good intentions no strings attached no expectations you 're lying to yourself   what you 've actually done is put money between yourselves because you have not laid down fair rules to cover every possibility   you 're not willing to plan for failure because you do n't want to admit failure is possible which is vain   once you leap into this bell jar the uncertainty of what happens if will itself into everyone 's thoughts slowly your relationship   it 's a recipe for disaster   that uncertainty puts her in a very uncomfortable position   she has to labor to make sure the issue does n't explode so she 's around you to avoid fights   every fight she 'll wonder if you 'll play the breakup card and threaten to demand the money back   the money will literally come between you this is what money does   thinking otherwise is a young person 's mistake of inexperience   do n't take my word on it contact suze orman and see what she says your lender is also not going to like those poorly defined lovers promises because they 've seen it all before and do n't want to yet again foreclose on a house that fighting lovers trashed   it 's like superhero battles are awesome unless you own the building they trashed   this thing can still be done but to remove this fraud of wishful thinking you need to plan for every possibility agree to outcomes that are fair and achievable put it in writing and share it with a neutral third party   you have n't done it because it seems like it would be awkward as hell and it will be or it will test your relationship by forcing direct honesty about a bunch of things you have n't talked about or are afraid to and it will and to be blunt your relationship may not be able to survive that much honesty   but if it does you 'll be in much better shape    the other passive fraud is taxes   by not defining the characteristics of the payment you up the question of how your contribution will be taxed if it will be taxed a proper contract with each other will settle that   there 's an argument to be made for involving a tax advisor in the design of that contract so that you can work things to your advantage   as an example defining the payment as rent is about the worst you could do as you will not be able to deduct any home expenses she will need to pay income tax on the rent but she can can not take landlord 's tax deductions on anything but the fraction of the house which is exclusively in your control i.e. none

he 's supposed to be grading him as a board member i do nt think that a board member 's vote should be seen as a positive or negative when it comes time for their job review    edit guys a board member is under no obligation to cast votes in public elections that are in the best interest of the company on which he boards in fact i would prefer board members who are autonomous citizens and have lives values and interests beyond the companies they board for example i would not discriminate against a board member of a bank who also supported bernie sanders    edit 2 people should not be discriminated against in the work place because of their politics religion gender race sexual orientation etc frankly i m alarmed that this tenant of democracy is being disputed i do nt want to live in a democracy where people have to have two sets of political beliefs one they put forth to appease their employer and the other they keep secret
