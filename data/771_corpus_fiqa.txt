why is a home loan mortgage cheaper than gold loan it has to do with risk lending money secured by gold is inherently riskier than a loan secure by your home increased risk means the lender must charge more that 's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes home loans are secured by the house houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value houses are easy to track down they ca n't be hidden or moved in the event that you do n't repay your loan houses are reasonably liquid they can be resold to pay off a defaulted loan

my doubt is whether bank of india gives any explicit incentives to banks to offer cheaper home loans currently no in the past loan against gold was considered priority sector lending loans to poor and agriculture etc every bank need to lead around 25 to priority sector hence quite a few banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as farm loan that almost never get recovered it is no longer the case now as loan against gold is not considered priority lending if it were just demand supply i feel that gold loans should have been cheaper   it is demand and supply there are quite a few reasons for this

generically interest rates being charged are driven in large part by the central bank 's rate and competition tends to keep similar loans priced fairly close to each other interest rates being paid are driven by what 's needed to get folks to lend you their money deposit in bank purchase bonds so it 's again related there certainly is n't very direct coupling but in general interest rates of all sorts do tend to swing very roughly in the same direction at very roughly the same time so the concept that interest rates of all types are rising or falling at any given moment is a simplification but not wholly unreasonable if you want to know which interest rates a particular person is citing to back up their claim you really need to ask them

as someone that works in and with the ag and commodity markets my understanding is limited but i hope it helps    aside from needing an infrastructure built to maintain the vast amounts of data communication pricing banking information having a closing time for our markets helps to ensure value and fair trade capitalism is centralized around creating a fair value for ventures to sell where prospective buyers opt to purchase or invest for example where i attended university there were many coffee shops close to campus but only one stayed open all night and as such had operational cost much higher than other shops forcing them to charge more for a cup of coffee while this example is crude the idea is the same by hours product or strategies and developments meant to increase projected value are allowed to occur    i imagine that if the markets did not close my coffee prices would skyrocket for an increased demand that of which the supply and farmers would struggle to meet the same would be said of grain salt oils etcetera

first a credit account is increased by credit transactions and decreased by debits liabilities is a credit account and should be a positive number   a debit account is increased by debit transactions and decreased by credit assets is a debit account and should be a positive number   equity = assets debit liabilities credit may be positive or negative   you currently are subtracting a negative number for a net positive since your liabilities is set as a debit account   how you currently are set > equity = assets debit liabilities debit it is easier to understand if you change the columns from increase decrease to credit debit i believe this is changed through edit > preferences > accounts > labels > use formal accounting labels   to fix your situation open up the loan account and switch columns on the amounts this will decrease opening balances and increase the loan per your current column   this is a of opening balances you see that opening balances is debited and the loan liability account credited i included petty cash to show the reverse petty cash is an asset so it credits opening balances and debits petty cash this is a student loan liability account as you see the opening balance is debited and decreased the loan is credited and liabilities increased as payments are made the reverse happens the loan being a credit account is debited and the balance decreases opening balances moves closer to 0 as well the savings account being a debit account is credited and the balance decreases there has been no change in equity since liabilities and assets by the same amount

first the stock does represent a share of ownership and if you have a different interpretation i 'd like to see proof of that secondly when the ipo or secondary offering happened that put those shares into the market int he first place the company did receive proceeds from selling those shares while others may profit afterward it is worth noting that more than a few companies will have secondary offerings convertible debt incentive stock options and restricted stock that may be used down the road that are all dependent upon the current trading share price in terms of how useful these can be used to fund operations pay executives and so forth third if someone buys up enough shares of the company then they gain control of the company which while you are n't mentioning this case it is something to note as some individuals buy stock so that they can take over the company which happens usually this has more of an overall plan but the idea here is that getting that control of the company 's voting shares are an important piece to things here

though it seems you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock including the fact that it 's at its 52-week high and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward   if you think it 's going to go up even further   more than the return on your other options for where to put the money keep the stock   if you think it 's peaked and will be going down now 's a good time to sell to put it another way if you did n't already have this stock would you buy it today your choice is just about the same you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares or the shares    which do you think is worth more you also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio   some are probably a larger percentage than others and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio   it may be time to do some rebalancing which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large as a of your portfolio and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you 're not as invested in as you would like to be   this might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio if part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional not purely financial you could sell now mark it as a win and move on to another opportunity   trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance but not everybody is into trading or money for money 's sake   what 's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life   if holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns from emotion based trading is acceptable   as cqm points out you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires expires the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls

to first understand exactly how collection agencies work it is important to know the background of the industry the industry started shortly after the great depression consumers were no longer able to pay for their accounts and companies did not know how to collect as far fetched as it seems one of the booming industries was the mafia pa and ma shops were paying for protection some because they were not given a choice   since the protection industry was doing well some of the employees for lack of better terms had the idea of collecting debt from the companies that were not getting paid sears macy 's and several other creditors decided to sell the unpaid debt to these collectors remember during this era there was no fdcpa to protect consumers the fdcpa was actually created because the mafia collectors were going door to door to collect and they were not nice about it   in the meantime there was another industry for lack of better words    rapidly expanding around the eastern part of the u.s. none other    than the mafia did the go and introduce himself and make a    sales pitch to sears offering to collect monies due to them not    hardly but as with any business ideas were made and created that    spurred from the main ideology of the original business associates of    the mafia marketed to the stores such as sears and offered to collect    the past due debt the big sell on this creditors did not have to    pay for the services the customer did originally this protection    industry was all about protecting the small ma and pop shops for a fee    but this time ma and pa did not have to pay the debtor did the idea    of collecting   past due debts spread like wildfire it was easy money    and there was nothing illegal about it the actual idea behind    collecting past due debt from creditors was genius it was a legit    collectable debt for a price this is why and how the fdcpa was created so when you deal with a third party collection agency you need to know that you are dealing with the of people the people that are hired as debt collectors are your typical ex felons there is a reason for this the good news is now there are laws put into place to protect your rights and your safety   agencies purchase what is called paper there is good and bad paper good paper are accounts just sold from the original creditor this includes all good information on the debtor such as phone number address etc sometimes the debt is collected and sometimes not either way it is common for a collection agency to resell the paper to another collection agency this is called 3rd placement

generally stock trades will require an additional capital gains and losses form included with a 1040 known as schedule d summary and schedule itemized   that year i believe the maximum capital loss was $ 3000 -the rest could carry over to future years the purchase date year only matters insofar as to rank the lot as short term or long position held 365 days or longer short term typically but depends on actual asset taxed then at 25 long term 15   the year a position was sold tells you which year 's filing it belongs in the tiny $ interest earned probably goes into schedule b typically a short form the irs actually has a hotline 800 1040 individuals   for quick questions such as advising which previous year filing forms they 'd expect from you   be sure to explain the custodial situation and that it all recently came to your awareness etc disclaimer i am no specialist you 'd need to verify everything i wrote it was just from personal experience with the irs and taxes

the main reason people go with lower interest accounts is for convenience of having the money in the same institution with other accounts like checking auto loans credit cards etc with their local bank these online savings accounts are regulated by law to only allow 6 transfers out per month so for people that need to make withdrawals more frequently that can also be a factor if someone has an account like this that is not part of their normal checking account it can also be inconvenient to wait for an ach to complete overnight before the funds are available in their main accounts i certainly use a higher yielding account for my very short term liquid savings

almost any kind of tax will cause market distortions if market distortions discourage activities which would have produced wealth society will lose out not only on the money which was taken by the tax but also on the wealth which could have been but was n't produced if those setting tax policy seek to maximize the amount of revenue that is made available for each dollar that the tax costs society taxing money which is being used to produce more wealth will go against that goal   further most of the things that companies do with their money to produce wealth end up generating taxable income for someone   if a company deducts from its taxes the money it pays to an employee who then has to pay taxes on that money the government ends up collecting about the same taxes as it would collect if the company did n't hire the employee and thus did n't take the deduction the effects of taxes on markets should be one of the most important factors considered when setting tax policy if one tax would cost society $ 1.05 for every dollar raised and another would cost society $ 5.00 for every dollar raised a wise policy would favor the first over the second   unfortunately politics often dominates over economic rationality

without making specific recommendations it is worthwhile to point out the differing tax treatments for a roth ira investments in a roth ira will not be taxed when you withdraw them during retirement unless they change the law on that or something crazy so if you are thinking about investing in some areas with high risk and high potential reward e.g. emerging market stocks then the roth ira might be the place to do it that way if the investment works out you have more money in the account that wo n't ever be taxed we can talk about the possible risks of certain kinds of investments but this is not an appropriate forum to recommend for or against them specifically healthcare stocks are subject to political risk in the current regulatory climate brics are subject to political risks regarding the political and business climate in the relevant nations and the growth of their economies need not correspond with growth in the companies you hold in your portfolio energy stocks are subject to the world economic climate and demand for oil unless you 're talking alternative energy stocks which are subject to political risk regarding their subsidies and technological risk regarding whether or not their technologies pan out it is worth pointing out that any etf you invest in will have a prospectus and that prospectus will contain a section discussing the risks which could affect your investment read it before investing

there 's truth to that although i 'm not sure if the ratio is quite 6 to 1 it is true that they are processing foreclosures much slower now after the robo signing fiasco and also that there is some justification for letting a house stay occupied rather than sit empty   i disagree with your assertion that smart banks would dump massive amounts of property at a loss selling their inventory quickly would slim their balance sheet which they been trying to do and let huge losses flow through their income statement that 's a bad way to achieve a good end even though the changes are purely accounting and not economic that 's not smart for any business operating in a vacuum and independent of competition whether a bank or a retailer should gm and ford sell their of cars at a massive loss now just to get rid of the property there 's underlying economic intrinsic value   properties in the biggest bust markets like and phoenix are down 2/3rds from the prices around one would argue that the prices are so low they fail to make economic sense florida was a huge bust market but today 's ny times talks about a recovery in property values fueled by   given that cities like vancouver and throughout the sf bay area have seen property prices recover in part fueled by foreign purchasers mostly china etc why would a bank not want to hold onto the property until it gets a good price

i agree with the others that pulling the money out of your 401(k is not the best idea due to the taxes and penalties   but i also think that a 401(k loan is not a good option either   somehow life happens and the time when you can least afford to repay the loan just after losing your job will be the time when you have to repay the loan or pay the taxes and penalties   there 's just too much risk there   you also lose the compounding gains you 'd get from the investment and it 's likely not worth sacrificing your future retirement for this it 's probably worth finding out how close you are to having your house appraise out for a successful re fi   without that information you 're just guessing   depending on how close you are you pile up as much cash as you can over the next few months to try to pay down the mortgage enough to qualify for the re fi   as you 're doing this if home values start coming up in your area you 'll have that going for you as well   it might even be worth suspending your 401(k contributions for a short while to give you more cash to put towards the re fi goal

this article is hilariously wrong   they studied companies that are already structured in such a way that they pay far less than rates   the vast majority of companies do not have sprawling international operations and can not benefit from these types of structures thus they are paying tax rates far closer to rates   the study is looking at the wrong companies and drawing a false conclusion from them   it ’s simple math   reducing tax rates makes companies more profitable providing more capital for expand and grow   growth requires adding employees   only a moron would argue that companies are better off and will grow faster when more of their profits are taken from them via taxation

share price is based on demand   assuming the same amount of shares are made available for trade then stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price   so say a company has 1000 shares in total and that company needs to raise $ 100 they decide to sell 100 shares for $ 1 to raise their $ 100 if there is demand for 100 shares for at least $ 1 then they achieve their goal but if the market decides the shares in this company are only worth 50 cents then the company only raises $ 50 so where do they get the other $ 50 they needed well one option is to sell another 100 shares the dilution comes about because in the first scenario the company retains ownership of 900 or 90 of the equity in the second scenario it retains ownership of only 800 shares or 80 of the equity the benefit to the company and shareholders of a higher price is basically just math any multiple of shares times a higher price means there is more value to owning those shares therefore they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount   a lot of starts up offer employees shares as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business so if you 're trying to attract the best and brightest it 's easier to offer them shares if they are worth more than those of company with a similar opportunity down the road share price can also act as something of a credit score in that a higher share price may reflect a more credit worthy company and therefore may make it easier for that company to obtain credit all else being equal it also makes it more expensive for a competitor to take over a company the higher the share price so it can offer some defensive and offensive advantages all ceteris paribus of course

never co sign a loan for someone especially family   taking out a loan for yourself is bad enough but co signing a loan is just plain stupid think about it if the bank is asking for a co signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan so why would you then step up and say i 'll pay back the loan if they do n't make me a co signer please here is a list of things that people never think about when they cosign a loan for somebody   now if you absolutely must co sign a loan here is how i would do it i the co signer would be the one who makes the payments to ensure that the loan was paid on time and i would be the one collecting the payment from the person who is getting the loan its a very simple way of preventing some of the worst situations that can arise and you should be willing to make the payments anyway after all that s what it means to cosign a loan your just turning things around and paying the loan upfront instead of paying after the applicant defaults and ruins every ones credit source user 's own blog post never co sign a loan for someone especially family

generally i would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available why pay interest if you have the money that is of course if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay which can happen if you got a very low apr for your car loan but then you probably have excellent credit already and should n't care about the history of the loan on your report re the 7 years vs 2 years to the best of my knowledge its not true it will stay 7 years even if its closed during the first year

another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money especially if much of your own money is in the stock market it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash even going by the likely relatively conservative £ 200k year before taxes you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3 5 years worth of pre tax income let 's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for £ 500 k at 3.5 interest not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed with a bit of negotiating i would n't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral that 's less than £ 1500/month in interest before any applicable tax effects less than 10 of the before tax income and like @victor wrote i think it 's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded the ceo makes more than £ 200k year given an income of £ 200k year and assuming 30 taxes on that amount the marginal tax would likely be higher and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a £ 500 k 3.5 debt is still about £ 10k month even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher that leaves quite a bit of money to be away in savings and other investments

i agree the cfa is nice for students who have the time to take the exam because it could be a year or two before the start working so it is a reasonable resume especially if your major is engineer science or math and you want to do finance   if you are trying to do a career change it is important to know the material because if you do n't then you ca n't do the job even if someone gives it to you but passing the test is n't as important as actually applying to the jobs and networking   i switched from engineering to finance buyside equity analyst originally i planned to take the cfa exams to help me with my transition but their new rule required a valid passport and it takes a while to get one so i missed the deadline for last december 's exam that turned out to be a good thing because i just started networking cold calling emailing applying to jobs etc and i got my current job if i had actually decided to take the cfa i would have wasted all my time preparing for the exam instead of trying to get the job potential employers know if you are good or not after talking to you for 15 minutes it has nothing to do with being able to memorize a set of formulas some the last name of some economists and their theories some accounting differences between gaap and etc for me it was the fact that i invest my own money and that i am able to explain my own investments very intelligently aka it needs to be a lot better than what you see on /r investing   if you know nothing about finance studying the cfa material and then taking the exam is a good thing you are going to be studying the material anyways if you are serious about a career change so might as well take the exam afterwards and get a resume i did end up taking the level 1 this month because my new employer paid for it i do n't think it adds any value once your foot is already in the door especially since it takes 5 years of experience to get the charter after that amount of time it 's all about job experience

this article is written by an idiot   risk failure risk = possibility of failure   reward return should be commensurate with risk and this is why long shot propositions should be worthwhile an example of this could be something like the following an investment with a 95 chance of success should return about 5 on the investment 1 in 20 risk of loss return on investment for taking the risk while a long shot investment with a 5 chance of success should be paying a 2000 return 1 in 20 will succeed but they will pay 20 times the investment if they do   an investment with a 0 chance of return that you are suckered into due to opacity is not an investment it is being robbed and it should be illegal wtf is opacity lying

use the black scholes formula if you know the current price an options strike price time until expiration and risk free interest rate then knowing the market price of the option will tell you what the market 's estimation of the volatility is this does rely on a few assumptions such as gaussian random walk but those are reasonable assumptions for most stocks you can also get a list of past stock prices put them in excel and ask excel to calculate the standard deviation with but that gives you the past volatility the market 's estimate of future volatility is more relevant

there could be a number of reasons for a rent increase the only information i can offer is how i calculate what rent i will charge the minimum i would ever charge per unit mortgage payment + water number of units this number is the minimum because it 's what i need to keep afloat   keep in mind these are ballpark numbers the target rent mortgage payment + water number of i mark up the price 60 for a few reasons first the building needs a repair budget that money has to come from somewhere second i want to put away for my next acquisition and third i want to make a profit these get me close to my rental price but ultimately it depends on your location and the comparables in the area if my target rent is 600 a month but the neighbors are getting 700 800 for the same exact unit i might ask more it also depends on the types of units some of my buildings all of the units are identical other buildings half of the units are bigger than the other half so clearly i would n't charge a equal amount for them ultimately you have to remember we 're not in the game to lose money i know what my renters are going to pay before i even put an offer in on a building because that 's how i stay in business it might go up over the years but it will always outpace my expenses for that property

most people who have over $ 250,000 in liquid cash savings would not want to start putting their money into regular savings accounts in different banks especially with interest rates as ridiculously low as they are now in 2014 15   people with money will want to diversify their investments in ways that will potentially earn them more money and they can also afford to seek the advice of financial planners who can help them do this wisely even if you decide to put $ 250,000 into various accounts at different banks i would n't necessarily trust that the fdic will be able to help you recover your money in the event that your banks go under   the amount of money available to the fdic to cover such losses pales in comparison to the actual amount of money that americans have in their bank accounts

in general saving money should be prioritized over extra debt payments every dollar that you spend paying down a debt will decrease the amount of principal owed this will directly decrease the future interest payments you will make however as time goes on you are dealing with a smaller and smaller set of principal additionally it is assumed that your income will grow or at least keep pace with inflation making the debt more on the other hand every dollar you save or invest now will increase your future income also making the future debt more not only that but the longer you save the more value to you get from having saved meaning you should save as early as possible finally the benefits of paying down the mortgage early end when the mortgage is completely paid off while the benefits of saving will continue and even grow after the house is owned free and clear   that is if you have an extra $ 100,000 to put into the mortgage during the life of the loan you could sink that into the mortgage and see it disappear or you could invest it and reap the dividends for the rest of your life caveat emptor behavior trumps numbers this only works if you will actually be disciplined about saving the extra money rather than paying off debt if you 're the kind of person for whom money burns a hole in your pocket until you spend it then use it on debt but if you are able to save and invest that money you will be better off in the long run

let me see if i can restate your question are speculative investments more volatile subject to greater spikes and drops in pricing than are more long term investments which are defined by the predictability of their dividend returns the short answer is yes   however where it gets complicated is in deciding whether something is a speculative investment take your example of housing   people who buy a house as an investment either choose to rent it out so receive rent as dividend or live in it foregoing dividends   either way the scale of the investment is large and this is often the only direct investment that people manage themselves   for this reason houses are bound up in the sentimental value people attach to a home the difficulty of and moving elsewhere in search of cheaper housing or better employment or the sunk cost of debt that ca n't be recovered by a fire sale   such inertia can lead to sudden sell offs as critical inflection points are reached such as hoped for economic improvements fail to and cash needs become critical at different levels that is true of just about every investment driving price volatility is the ease of sale and the trade offs involved   a share that offers regular and dependable dividends even if its absolute value falls is going to be hung on to more frequently than those shares that suffer a similar decline but only offer a capital gain   for the latter the race is on to sell before the drop any remaining capital gain the investor may have experienced a house with a good tenant or a share with stable dividends will be kept in preference for the quick cash return of selling an asset that offers no such ongoing returns this would result visually in more curves for speculative shares while more stable shares are by periods of stability with moments of mania but i have to take your query further since you provide graphical evidence to support your thesis   your charts combine varying time scales different sample rates and different scales one of which is even a log scale   it becomes impossible to draw any sort of meaningful micro comparison unless they 're all presented using exactly the same criteria

secondly should we pay off his student loans before investing the subsidized loans wo n't be gaining any interest until he graduates so i was wondering if we should just pay off the unsubsidized loans and keep the subsidized ones for the next two years from a purely financial standpoint if the interest you gain on your savings is higher than the interest of the debt then no otherwise yes if we were to keep 5,000 in savings and pay of the 3,000 of unsubsidized loans as i described above that would leave us with about 15,000 dollars that is just lying around in my savings account how should i invest this would you recommend high risk or low risk investments i 'm not from the us so take my answer with caution but to me $ 15,000 seems a minimum safety net then again it depends very much on any external help you can get in case of an emergency

yesterday there were a pair of shoes a deer and a bushel of apples in the world today of those three things there is only a pair of shoes and a deer   your legal expertise might be able to find some kind of recoverable asset to get the shoemaker back his money but even the supreme court can not rule the destroyed value back into existence the economy is poorer than it was before the fire no matter how we move the loddars the loddars are just markers for the underlying value of actual stuff goods and services that are actually useful    analogies are problematic because they are inaccurate but as a half measure explanation you could imagine that the loddars are poker chips   four people down to play a game of poker and each puts $ 20 cash into a kitty and takes out $ 20 worth of chips    a freak of wind comes along and blows one of the $ 20 bills out the window    now there is only $ 60 in the kitty even though we each have $ 20 in chips as a lawyer you might be able to identify some person who is liable for that $ 20 shortage but as an economist i see that this little economy is now $ 20 poorer and no matter how well anyone plays the total output of the poker play is going to produce less than $ 80 value    now go back and pretend that the poker chips are instead cash currency and the cash in the kitty is actual goods and services again analogies are problematic you can move the markers around however you want but but some part of the underlying value has been destroyed

the argument you are making here is similar to the problem i have with the stronger forms of the efficient market hypothesis   that is if the market already has incorporated all of the information about the correct prices then there 's no reason to question any prices and then the prices never change   however the mechanism through which the market incorporates this information is via the actors buying an selling based on what they see as the market being incorrect the most basic concept of this problem i think starts with the idea that every investor is passive and they simply buy the market as one basket   so every paycheck the index fund buys some more stock in the market in a completely static way   this means the demand for each stock is the same   no one is paying attention to the actual companies performance so a poor performer 's stock price never moves   the same for the high performer   the only thing moving prices is demand but that 's always up at a more or less constant rate this is a topic that has a lot of discussion lately in financial circles   here are two articles about this topic but i 'm not convinced the author is completely serious hence the worst case scenario title these are interesting reads but again take this with a grain of salt   you should follow the links in the articles because they give a more nuanced understanding of each potential issue   one thing that 's important is that the reality is nothing like what i outline above one of the links in these articles that is interesting is the one that talks about how we now have more indexes than stocks on the us markets   the writer points to this as a problem in the first article but think for a moment why that is   there are many different types of strategies that active managers follow in how they determine what goes in a fund based on different stock metrics   if a stocks p e ratio drops below a critical level for example a number of indexes are going to sell it   some might buy it   it 's up to the investors you and me to pick which of these strategies we believe in another thing to consider is that active managers are losing their clients to the passive funds   they have a vested interest in attacking passive management

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

no one can claim markets are perfectly efficient the stiglitz paradox explains one reason why it is impossible for the market to be perfectly and there are plenty of investors that show it is practically possible to consistently beat the market e.g. the of graham and or 's medallion fund   however even if you accept as true that prices behave strangely around round numbers that is n't a of the efficient market hypothesis the efficient market hypothesis says that price reflect all available information so the expected price tomorrow is just the price today not taking into account the time value of money   the efficient market hypothesis says nothing about how prices are distributed historically a random walk has been used but that is neither a consequence of the emh nor a required assumption   you could say that prices are more volatile the nearer they are to a round number or new high but that does n't necessarily give you an edge in making money off the stock

there are several tactics you might employ to help the situation   you have two options one is to increase your income the other is to reduce your expenditure   paying off debt will also help but that may not apply to you most people find it easier to reduce expenditure so i will explain that first of all then make sure you track your actual expenditure the budget check it daily and make sure it is accurate if you spend some money you did n't budget for then mark that down and make sure you budget for it going forward most people are surprised at how much they are actually spending especially on trivial things like coffee lunch at work etc   you will then find you can start to reduce this expenditure maybe by bringing lunch to work skipping coffee every other day etc by doing a budget you can reduce your expenditure and hopefully have some money left over to save put a line in your budget marked savings ideally on the day you get paid so you do n't spend it if you ned to save $ x by y date then work out how much that works out in a month and put that into your budget if you have n't got enough spare to do that then onto stage 2 with regards to increasing income the obvious way is to do some overtime at work can you do that alternatively you can get a part time job maybe a hobby that pays money   i personally enjoy building web sites as a hobby and i get about $ 20 a month from advertising on those it 's not much but it adds up over time finally how to actually save what methods are there lots of options here personally i buy shares with my savings making sure i pick stocks that are currently cheap this is quite risky and may not suit you but it works for me as i do n't sell the shares until i actually need the money other options are regular savings accounts that pay a bonus after you 've had the money in for usually 12 months etc   they tend to pay a bonus at the end so you are to not touch your cash but you can get it out if you really need it you can also work out how much spare cash you have monthly and then give yourself an allowance each month that you can spend on impulse items but make sure you stick to that good luck

it 's not impossible to forecast the future price of a commodity however it 's exactly that an educated guess much like the weather and the further out that prediction is made the higher the percentage error is expected a lot of information is gathered by various instruments etc at a very high cost of time and money to produce a prediction that starts breaking down after about five days and is no more than a wild guess after about ten how accurately a price can be forecast depends on the commodity there are seasonal and thus cyclical changes in many commodities on top of which there is a general trend which is nearer term a pretty decent prediction can thus be arrived at with a relatively simple seasonally adjusted percentage change algorithm take a moving average of the last few measurements compute the percent change versus the same period last year current minus last divided by last and multiply it by last year 's number for the current day or month to arrive at a pretty decent prediction for the current and near future periods up to about as far ahead as you have looked behind another thing you may need to do is normalize many price graphs are very the price of a stock may fluctuate many percentage points on a single day and there 's a lot of noise inherent in them a common tool to normalize is a box and plot which for a given time period will aggregate all samples within that period and give you a measurement of the lowest sample highest sample median and the range of each 25 of the full sample space box plots can also be plotted on the range or middle fifty this throws away the very noisy outliers and a much more regular plot from the inner part of the bell curve you can reverse engineer a best fit line connecting the elements of each box and the closer two lines are the more likely the real future data will be around that area because the between those to lines is very dense 25 of the values are in a very small range meaning many samples occurred there lastly there are outside factors that are not included in simple percentage growth big news must be taken into account by introducing more subjective guesses about future data if you see an active hurricane season coming or a hurricane bearing down on houston then it 's reasonable to assume that the price of oil and/or refined oil products like gas and jet fuel will skyrocket a cyclical growth model will not predict these events but you can factor in the likelihood of a big change with a base onto which you add last year 's numbers and onto that you add regular growth conversely when a huge spike happens due to a non cyclical event like a natural disaster you must smooth it out by reducing the readings to fit in the curve otherwise your model for next year will expect the same anomaly at the same time and so it will be wrong these adjustments are necessary but the more of them you make the less the graph reflects real history and the more it reflects what you think it should have been

come on man the reason walmart workers are unionizing is because they ca n't get their employer to follow the law and if any of these workers try to stand up for themselves alone they will lose their job this is much more about respect then it is about money do we really want jobs where your boss can cut your hours in half arbitrarily because he did n't like something you said or where you have to come to work sick and make food all day because you are not to take sick days i 'm not saying unions are perfect but they are the only way workers could possibly attain a sense of respect and security in these low paying industries

to add to the already existing answers most of the dotcom companies used an accounting so that everything looked rosy to account for revenues what dotcom companies did was get into a barter transaction with another dotcom company by selling advertising space and stuff on each other 's website so the final outcome was each had quite a substantial amount of revenue while in reality there was n't any revenue earned this cooked up their books to look quite rosy to investors who then poured in their money without realizing they were pouring money into a black hole as someone mentioned cisco which sells networking gear and was heavily dependent on the dotcom boost so when everything went bust its stock price also crashed heavily   this was for the losers but some good ones did sail through dotcom companies which had substance took a hit in fact everybody did during the bust but more than made up for it later on when investors realized they are valuable

my current favorite service for this kind of transfer is transferwise the fees are quite low when compared to the 2.5 3 by high street banks for currency conversion to which you need to add the international wire transfer fee and it 's often a lot faster as they split it into two domestic transfers while the international part + currency conversion happens internally to transferwise

my basic rule of thumb is that if the the bill come from a government office of taxation and that if you fail to pay the amount they can put a tax lien on the property it is a tax for you the complication is in assessments for local benefits     you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property    local benefits include the construction of streets sidewalks or    water and sewer systems you must add these amounts to the basis of    your property   you can however deduct assessments or taxes for    local benefits if they are for maintenance repair or interest    charges related to those benefits an example is a charge to repair an    existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge   if only a    part of the assessment is for maintenance repair or interest    charges you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the    deduction if you can not show what part of the assessment is for    maintenance repair or interest charges you can not deduct any of it an assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your    real estate tax bill if so use the rules in this section to find how    much of it if any you can deduct i have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets and the rest i for things the irs says you can deduct the issue is that if the center city tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count i would go back to the first line of the quote from pub you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to    increase the value of your property then i would look at the quote from the ccd web site the center city district ccd is a business improvement district our    mission is to keep philadelphia 's downtown called center city clean    safe beautiful and fun we provide security cleaning and promotional    services that supplement but do not replace basic services provided    by the city of philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of    property owners ccd also makes physical improvements to the downtown installing and maintaining lighting > signs banners trees and landscape elements   and later on the same page ccd directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in    the district ccd also receives voluntary contributions from the    owners of tax exempt properties that benefit from our services the issues is that it is a business improvement district bid and you are n't a business i did find this document from the city of philadelphia explain how to establish a bid if the nature of the bid is such that organizers wish to include    residential properties within the district and make these properties    subject to the assessment it may make sense to assess these    properties at a lower level than a commercial property both because    bid services and benefits are business focused and because    owner occupants often can not treat assessments as tax deductible    business expenses like commercial owners do care must be taken to    ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment    rates is equitable and complies with the requirements of the from the same document funds for bid programs and services are generated from a special    assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the    organization that manages the bid ’s activities note many leases    have a clause that allows property owners to pass the bid assessment    on to their tenants because they are authorized by the city of    philadelphia the assessment levied by the bid becomes a legal    obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the    filing of a lien i have seen discussion that some bids can accept tax deductible donations this means if a person they can deduct the donation i would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because if you ca n't deduct it that would mean the only people who ca n't deduct it are home owners   so deduct it keep in mind i am not a tax professional

support and resistance points indicate price levels where there have been a large amount of trading activity usually from institutions that tend to stabilize the price of a stock support is a temporary floor where people have been buying in large quantities that means there 's a good chance that the stock wo n't go below this level in the near term but if it does watch out resistance is a temporary ceiling where people have been selling when the stock price hits this level people tend to sell and push it back down until there are no more sellers at this level then the price could skyrocket if there is enough buying

in my experience shiller is always way before his time with his predictions and often it comes at too early a point for anyone actually making some money to care about his view is very long term and i trust his predictions because he so accurately predicted so many of the and the measures that would follow he even predicted that there would be bailouts in his book irrational exuberance   his were poo as doom and gloom and manipulative until every piece started falling apart in the specific order of events give or take that they did   i personally think people like dr. shiller make bold predictions that are hard to swallow the derivatives market is a bit about rolling into bull territory with any kind of housing index but warren buffet 's old adage to buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying paraphrase i see this as a good long term investment because i trust shiller 's judgement he stuck to his guns when the doubts were at him   and krugman et al to some extent and he turned out to be more than   to me these kinds of sources are usually pretty sound the man knows what he 's talking about and i would n't mind picking up a piece of that action especially if the market just does n't trust any real estate investments it 's pretty easy to realize that right now housing will be undervalued and now that mortgage applications are supposedly stricter i think there 's a good argument to be made that this economist should continue to exceed expectations

check the terms of your mortgage if you are in a fixed term mortgage you can likely over pay a fixed amount of the capital each year typically 10 eg if you owe £ 300,000 on the mortgage you can pay off an additional £ 30,000 this year next year you 'd owe something like £ so could pay off £ 26,000 you 'd need to check the terms of your mortgage to see what this limit is you can actually pay off more than this but would become liable to pay an early repayment fee or similar which is usually something like 3 5 of the mortgage amount note that this usually means you would need to re finance the mortgage anyway if you are not on a fixed term mortgage than in the uk at least you are pretty much free to over pay as much as you would like or refinance the mortgage if you are in a fixed term mortgage it is usually better to simply over pay by that maximum allowed amount until the fixed period ends at which point you can re finance onto a mortgage that allows higher overpayments this is n't always the case though depending on your interest rate how high the early repayment charge is and how much you are able to over pay at the very least you 're going to need to do some sums if you do choose to over pay up to the limit then you 'd want to over pay as much as you can at the start of the year ie do n't divide the over payment by 12 pay it all as early as you can to reduce interest payments then once you hit the limit put the rest into a savings account once you are out of the fixed term you can then pay the rest as a lump sum when refinancing

credit in general having no significant change between an income level or net worth is due to the economic reciprocity principle inherent in many societies although some areas of credit may be more admirable to those who are n't as well off such as car loans the overall understanding of credit is a trust agreement between someone getting something e.g. credit card user and someone giving something e.g. bank or company credit does n't have to mean just money it can be anything of value including tangible materials services etc the fact is that a credit is a common element in most economical systems and as such its use is not really variable between income levels etc sure there is variance in things like credit line amounts and rewards but the overall gist is the same for everyone borrowing paying back benefits etc all of these exchanges form the same understanding we all know and follow credit brings along with it trust the form represented in a score while not everyone may depend entirely on credit and no one should use credit as a means of getting by entirely money everyone can understand and reap the benefits of a system whether they make 10 k a year of 10 m a year this is the general idea behind credit in the broadest sense possible besides just because one has or makes more money does n't mean they do n't prefer to get good deals nobody should like being taken advantage of and if credit can help anyone can establish trust

nobody has consistently doubled their investment year after year not even the like george soros and warren buffett mr. buffett 's average annual returns have been over 20 for over 50 years that 's about twice the american average of a year so mr. buffett has been twice as good as average for his adult life that 's like having a 200 iq and in a poll taken in 2000 he was rated the greatest portfolio manager of all time no lesser person could hope to do better what has happened is that people may double their investment in one year then give some back the following year or else go through several years of average returns the reason is that they will have an investment style that works for one particular market but not for all markets so they will have to wait for their best market to have their best year

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

you do not have to pay tax on any earnings inside a tfsa quoting wikipedia 's article investment income including capital gains and dividends earned in a tfsa is not taxed even when withdrawn this is backed up by the official tfsa government site which states investment income earned in a tfsa is tax free this makes the tfsa an appropriate vehicle to store investments which produce dividends for example if you invest $ 5500 and receive a total of $ 500 in dividends this year you will not pay tax on that $ 500 either in this tax year or even subsequently when you withdraw money out of your tfsa of course tfsas are n't meant to be used for regular withdrawals if you are planning on investing $ 5500 this year and withdrawing the dividends i 'd urge you to be careful and consider if this is actually the best sort of savings vehicle for you but that 's really just a general warning nothing specific to dividends it is possible to do this indeed withdrawing $ 500 in dividends this year will increase your available contribution room in the next tax year not in this tax year for example you contribute $ 5500 at the beginning of this year by the end of november you have accumulated $ 500 in dividends you withdraw these in december in the following tax year you can this $ 500 in addition to the standard $ 5500 contribution room so you could contribute $ 6000 just be careful with your calculations i messed mine up and ended up paying a rather substantial penalty for my overcontribution

1 how does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation and at worst it should be viewed as a liability and has no place alongside other real investments periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with interest rates any home is a liability as has been pointed out in other answers it costs money to live in it costs money to keep in good shape and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total in fact as long as you have an outstanding mortgage it actually costs you money to own even when not considering things like property taxes utilities etc the only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own but then you ca n't live in it instead 2 how should one view payments on a home mortgage how are they similar or different to investing in low risk low reward investments like joetaxpayer said in a comment paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost adjusting for tax effects what is important to remember about paying off a mortgage besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time is that over time it improves your cash flow if interest rates do n't change unlikely then as long as you keep paying the interest but do n't pay down the principal assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity you currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end now suppose that you were to lose your job which means a significant cut in the household income if this cut means that you ca n't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row it 's also possible with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further if the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario it 's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now some do n't but that 's a completely different question you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day any fixed expenses which can not easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them the earlier you get the mortgage paid off the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well what is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings on the other hand money in stocks bonds various mutual funds and savings accounts tends to be highly liquid it is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form some of it in very low risk investments such as a simple interest bearing savings account or government bonds despite their low rate of return before you start to aggressively pay down loans because particularly when you own a home you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money

there 's no free lunch here are some positions that should be economically equivalent same risk and reward in a theoretically pure universe with no regulations or transaction costs you 're proposing to buy the call if you look at the equivalent stock plus protective put you can quickly see the catch the protective put is expensive that same expense is embedded in the call option see put call parity on wikipedia for more you could easily pay 10 a year or more for the protection which could easily eat up most of your returns if you consider that average returns on a stock index might be about 10 nominal not real another way to look at it is that buying the long call and selling a put which is a synthetic long position in the stock would give you the put premium so by not selling the put you should be worse off than owning the stock worse than the synthetic long by about the value of the put premium or yet another way to look at it is that you 're repeatedly paying time value on the long call option as you roll it in practical world instead of theory world i think you 'd probably get a noticeable hit to returns just from bid ask and commissions even without the cost of the protection options cost more a bit some practical complications of equivalency between different combinations of options and underlying are anyway roughly speaking any position without the downside risk is going to have an annual loss built in due to the cost of the protection occasionally the options market can do something weird due to supply demand or liquidity issues but mostly the parity relationships hold or hold closely enough that you ca n't profit once expenses are considered update one note i 'm talking about vanilla options as traded in the us here i guess there are some somewhat different products elsewhere i 'm not sure exactly which derivatives you mean all derivatives have a cost though or nobody would take the other side of the trade

first of all bear in mind that there 's no such thing as a risk free investment if you keep your money in the bank you 'll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation the same is true for other safe investments like government bonds gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear they 're certainly not low risk repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea you 'll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit and of course there 's always the risk that prices would go down not up buying a property to keep and preferably live in might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up it 's very hard to say where prices will go in future on the one hand london prices are very high by historical standards but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come i tend to think of a house as something that i need one of for the rest of my life and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wo n't go up substantially if you own a house you 're insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live however that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere

i wondered about this problem too so i looked into the maths and made this app it uses the free document format player if you try it out you can see what conditions favour renting vs buying   my own conclusion was to aim to buy a property outright upon reaching retirement age if not sooner example this example compares buying a £ 400,000 house with renting for £ 1,000 a month while depositing equivalent amounts in savings to total the same monthly outgoings as the buyer   mortgage rate deposit rate property appreciation and rent inflation can be specified   the example mortgage term is 20 years   as you can see the buyer and renter come out about even after the mortgage term but the buyer comes off better after that having no more mortgage to pay   of course the rent to live in a £ 400,000 house would probably be more than £ 1,000 but this case shows an equivalence point

first of all you nit wit are a group of languages which includes arabic and the arabs by far outnumber you so i ca n't be anti semitic   how the jews have seemed to take the phrase semitic and coin anti semitic to mean a hatred of jews seems to me classic jewish misdirection you may rest assured i hate no language   now if you wish to speak about why i think the jews have been a plague on mankind through the centuries and always the root cause of strife and conflict i have many valid arguments to their display of despicable behavior starting with palestine and the apartheid regime the world looks away from in shame   right here in america we have the jewish control of the federal reserve and the treasury and banking system which continuously put us through the boom and bust cycle we have jews the white house and driving policies that are anti america and pro israel and the we can argue the subject for as long as you like   my point here was that the american people have become so blind and that america can be taken to war in iraq because israeli intelligence decided that they had wmd and it was a threat to israel syria is also a threat to israel and iran is also a threat to israel and so is afghanistan and of course pakistan and saudi arabia   from the looks of it israel and the jews seem to think a majority of the semitic world is out to destroy them so it would seem actually the pitiful few jews left over after the holocaust are actually the anti   and most surprising is the fact that the pitiful few jews actually grew in population during the course of wwii which would actually quite possibly with that rate of breeding make them rabbits thus i would have to plead guilty of being anti rabbits and thank the lord that rabbits have lots of natural predators or jews would grow as big as but fortunately the british had the foresight to not make israel in australia because while they took a pair of rabbits there in the 1700 hundreds look at their population now   we would have a serious jew population explosion on our hands and since they would then be a majority of the semitic languages would be forced to the rabbit population in australia using biological agents and the few potent ones left we could eat in what could later be called the big roast on the in the biggest act of antisemitism that never happened   i am afraid at this point i would like to take the phrase antisemitism back from you and suggest you use a phrase closer to what you are trying to say jew hater   as for me i absolutely hate fucking rabbits

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

your problem is one that has challenged many people   as you said there are two aspects to balancing a budget reducing expenses or increasing income   and you state that you have done all the cost cutting that you can find   looking at ways to increase your income is a good way to balance your budget how big is your problem   do you need to find another $ 100/month or do you need $ 1000/month   there are many part time jobs you could obtain fast food retail grocery you could obtain a sales job cars real estate even working for a recruiting firm where you could connect buyers and sellers   if your need is $ 100/month a part time job on weekends would fill the gap when i was trying to solve my budget problems a few years ago i thought that i needed to increase my income   and i did increase my income   but then i realized that my expenses were too high   and i re evaluated my priorities   i challenge you to revisit your expenses   often we assume that we need things that we really can not afford   consider a few of your possible expenses my problems included mortgage debt auto loans high utilities high car insurance too much spending on kids activities and a few other problems

i do n't think you 're missing anything on the math side as far as the payments   likewise it may seem everyone 's driving a nicer car but i 'm going to predict that 's based on area and a few other factors for instance my used car feels like riches in a college town   the behavior of why people would pay money especially with high interest debt for something is a little different to explain the behavior behind people who purchase luxury cars for some people a car is a purchase that they value similar to a person valuing the clothes they wear the house they live in or the equipment they buy and either borrowing or paying full price on an expensive car is worth it to them   we can call it a status symbol and criticize the financial waste without realizing wait this is something they value like a rare book collector likes rare books would a rare book collector pass on borrowing money if it meant a once in a lifetime rare book purchase opportunity have you ever felt wow this is cool awesome amazing with something   basically that 's how many of them feel toward these cars   as much as i 'd love to say they 're only doing it for status because i 'm not a car person that 's actually somewhat de and the more i 've met people like this the more i 've realized this is their thing and to them it 's totally worth it even with all the debt   i have no doubt that there 's a percentage of them who truly may be misled maybe they do n't realize the full cost of borrowing money or leasing   still for those who do n't care the full cost that 's because it 's their thing   we can all agree that it 's still not wise to do financially borrow on a luxury vehicle and it wo n't change that some people will do it

a big part of the answer depends on how beaten down the stock is how long it will take to recover from the drop and your taste for risk if you honestly believe the drop is a temporary then averaging down can be a good strategy to lower your dollar cost average in the stock   but this is a huge risk if you 're wrong because now you 're going to your losses by piling on more stock that is n't going anywhere to the shares you already own at a higher cost as pointed out correctly the problem for most investors following an average down strategy is that it makes them much less likely to cut their losses when the stock does n't recover   they basically become married to the stock because they 've their belief the stock will bounce back when maybe it never will or worse drops even more

there is a misunderstanding    the business and the owner are not the same entity   you said    i give the business $ 25,000 and take 50 of the business no you can give the owner of the business 25 k and now he has 25 k and 50 of a 50 k business    that 25 k sits in mr. smith 's bank account not acme widget 's account    a more simple example is when you buy a car   the money goes to the car dealership it does not get put into the car 's glove box you may be thinking of an investor in a business   he could pump $ $ into the business as operating capital for a share of the business   in that case it would be a bit unfair to get 50 of the business for a 25k.   however the owner may be interested in doing such a deal because value of the investor can add more than just $ $ to the business   having a celebrity investor might do more good for the business than the actual dollars another situation is that the owner might be desperate   without a influx of cash the whole business might end there are guidelines to business evaluation but valuing them is not an easy thing

typically labor is a company 's largest expense so when a company receives tax cuts that does n't translate to more hiring long term if the company expands it might but it could also choose to invest in a better or different products maybe more efficient business processes or invest in overseas operations additionally labor has a diminishing value just because we could hire more people to make more things does n't mean we should    side note in many states the largest employers are the state local governments schools public services etc and healthcare providers   this tax cut is great for people that are already invested or high income earners because it lowers the overall tax brackets and aligns capital gains to those so say i had a million dollars invested and earned a yearly 10 dividend return i 'd earn 100k in dividends and pay 25 as income tax source   however something like 50 of all americans are invested in the stock market only the top 10 average investments close to a million in investments example above and 38 of all investments are owned by the 1 source   tax cuts while popular would n't ever help stimulate consumer spending esp considering the amount of consumer debt that exists ~1 trillion what these tax cuts would do create more debt for tax payers

treat each position or partial position as a separate lot each time you open a position a new lot of shares is created if you sell the whole position then the lot is closed done but if you sell a partial quantity you need to create a new lot split the original lot into two the quantities in each are the amount sold and the amount remaining if you were to then buy a few more shares create a third lot if you then sell the entire position you 'll be closing out all the remaining lots this allows you to track each buy sell pairing for each lot simply calculate return based on cost and proceeds you ca n't derive an annualized number for all the lots as a group because there 's no common timeframe that they share if you wish to calculate your return over time on the whole series of trades consider using it treats these positions plus the cash they represent as a whole portfolio see my post in this thread how can i calculate a running return using xirr in a spreadsheet

this is precisely the problem   economic contraction scared people   so instead of continuing making promises they started paying off the promises they had for fear that something in the future would make it so they could n't   this resulted in increased economic contraction because it became more difficult to trade money for service because people basically valued paying off debt more than the service   the biggest issue is that neither position is wrong yet they do n't work well together   people paying off debt is fine so long as there is money for services and people paying for service is fine so long as they do n't rack up more debt than they can pay   really it 's the transitions that always get us   further these transitions are constantly repeated which is why the economic data so often displays patterns

my wife and i have been car free since 2011   we spent about $ 3500 on car shares and rentals last year i went through it recently to flag trips that were medical transportation and unreimbursed work related for taxes   this compares favorably with the last year of car ownership   i had reached a point i started needing $ 200 + repairs every couple of months and the straw that broke the back was a dealer mechanic estimate but still $ 3000 estimate to pass emissions inspection    over 11 years the value went from $ to $ 3600 so it depreciated about 2k per year    i was easily spending $ 40 per week on gasoline on my last commute    i now use transit with the irs commuter benefit so i do have a base after tax transportation expense of 1200 per year   we use weekend rentals about 2x per month and do use a warehouse club   she uses rentals for her job about 12 times per year and the medical transportation came in an intense burst    access our nearest is 0.22 miles 3 blocks there are two hotels with full service rental car desks about half a mile from our house and every brand at the station a mile away   there are concrete benefits to density take every advantage insurance i always take the rental company daily insurance for $ 15 per day   certain no annual fee credit cards automatically include   every time an insurance agent cold calls me i ask for a quote for a named non owner policy i 'd probably take it if the premium was   $ 300 or less per 6 months    tips and tricks a minivan or truck rate is probably higher than a car but compared to a full service rental may be much lower the best value i spend no time in my life looking for a parking spot and spend this hour tapping away on se on a train instead of driving

several student loans are backed by government guarantee and this will allow you to get attractive rates this may require them to consolidate the three classes of loans separately many commercial banks offer consolidation services one example is discussed at other methods of consolidation are of course anything that pays off the original loan if available using a parent 's home equity line of credit to pay of the loans and then paying back the parents can save money an additional benefit of heloc style loans is that they are very flexible in their payment terms for example you may pay $ 25 per year to keep the account open and then only be required to make interest payments links

i would like to add my in saving $ 3000 it is an accomplishment that the majority of us households are unable to achieve source while it is something in some ways it is hardly anything   working part time at a entry level job will earn you almost three times this amount per year and with the same job you can earn about as much in two weeks as this investment is likely to earn in the market in one year    all this leads to one thing   at your age you should be looking to increase your income   no matter if it is college or a high paying trade whatever you can do to increase your life time earning potential would be the best investment for this money    i would advocate a more patient approach   stick the money in the bank until you complete your education enough for an adult job   use it if needed for training to get that adult job   get a car a place of your own and a sufficient enough wardrobe   save an emergency fund   then invest with impunity imagine two versions of yourself   one with basic education a average to below average salary that uses this money to invest in the stock market   eventually that money will be needed and it will probably be pulled out of the market at an in opportune time   it might worth less than the original 3 k now imagine a second version of yourself that has an above average salary due to some good education or training   perhaps that 3 k was used to help provide that education   however this second version will probably earn 25,000 to 75,000 per year then the first version   which one do you want to be   which one do you think will be wealthier    better educated people not only earn more they are out of work less   you may want to look at this chart

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

you are missing the fact that the company can buy back its own shares for simplicity imagine the case that you own all of the shares of xyz corporation   xyz is very profitable and it makes $ 1 m per year   there are two ways to return $ 1 m to you the shareholder 1   the company could buy back some fraction of your shares for $ 1 m or   2   the company could pay you a $ 1 m dividend after 1 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 2 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 1 the total number of shares would be fewer but saying you owned less of xyz would be like complaining that you are shorter when your height is measured in inches than in so indeed a buyback is an alternative to a dividend furthermore buybacks have a number of tax advantages over dividends to taxable shareholders see my answer in can i get a dividend free lunch by buying a stock just before the ex dividend date and selling it immediately after   that said it is important to recognize the shareholders who are less savvy about knowing when to accept the buyback by correctly valuing the company can get burned at the profit of the savvy shareholders   a strategy to avoid being burned if you are n't price savvy is simply to sell a fraction in order to get your pro rata share of the buyback in many respects simulating a dividend but still reaping some but not all of the tax advantages of a buyback

on this the best thing you can do is ask current analysts for help you 're new and people expect you to ask dumb questions at this point so ask them now while you still get a pass   with that being said there 's a strategy to it before you ever ask a question spend at least 5 minutes trying to figure out the answer on your own op did a google search which is great so many people wo n't do this finally the way you ask the question is key i would go to an analyst and say boss asked me to get a list of all us apartment flooring companies i looked on google to see if i could find anything there if you were doing this where would you go to find the information   they 'll usually even walk you through how to do it if there 's something special with the service you have for the task you 'll also make them feel important and you 'll get the task done fast   also if you run into trouble with the boss after presenting it you can always back yourself up by saying you asked around the office for what tool to use and people told you to use that but be strategic with how you say it because you do n't want to throw anyone under the bus

this is n't some new revelation pensions have been around for a long time and the bankruptcy code is complex and has developed over a long period of time along side it there is a strong reason why secured creditors are favored over unsecured creditors because we want creditors to actually make loans and finance operations investment expansion etc if you eliminate the secured creditors priority then loans do n't get made in the first place the company ca n't offer pensions let alone salaries because the company is n't likely to exist or at least it would be much smaller   the claims of employees are valid nobody is questioning that but they are just lower priority than those of secured creditors who only made loans on the promise that they could recover some assets if ever the loans go into default   this is also another reason pensions have gone out of style in favor of 401ks it is foolish to rely on whether a company will exist 10 20 or 30 years down the road companies are always rising and falling in the economy and there is no reason to expect one to just exist in perpetuity

below are some of the differences between fedwire credit transfers and ach credit transfers in the us fedwire same day clearing which means the sender 's account is debited and your account is credited on the same day irrevocable   once a fedwire is sent the originator sender can not send a reversing transaction   this is a huge advantage of using because it mitigates risk of reversals cost   fedwire typically cost more to send and to receive ach credit aka direct deposit allows for reversals   sender originator does have the ability to perform reversals or correcting entries batch processing   ach entries are group together into batches and processed by financial institutions and the ach operators in batch mode you can find additional information regarding ach at and fedwire at

when i first started working in finance i was given a rule of thumb to decide which price you will get in the market you will always get the worst price for your deal so when buying you get the higher ask price and when selling you get the lower bid price i like to think of it in terms of the market as a participant who always buys at the lowest price they can i.e. buys from you and sells at the highest price they can if that were n't true there would be an arbitrage opportunity and free money never exists for long

i certainly think there is some truth here but a lot of those jobs have become more competitive because of schooling requirements you do n’t have to study to be electrician but it ’s 2017 it will certainly give you a leg up everyone requires some kind of schooling unions are great but those dying or dead in most places it ’s nice your husband ’s place offers apprenticeships because those are few and far between today    i think it ’s partially true that people do n’t look in the right places i do n’t think people are lazy then you also have to keep in mind socio economic status a lot of people are very poor and mildly educated and those jobs just are n’t there for them it ’s beyond a jobs problem at this point a lot of people are studying people in grinding poverty like victims    this is why i was trying to say that i do n’t really know how to fix it a lot of people are beyond help at this point and telling them to get off their lazy ass and get a job is n’t as easy as it sounds it ’s great your husband has a union and a good job but that ’s not the case for everyone there are a lot of moving parts there check out a little background research on that it brings a little more perspective it ’s complex    edit i ’m reading that a lot of trade unions will sponsor apprenticeships which goes to my other point that unions are dead come to wisconsin and try to find a union job good fucking luck

in the us it is perfectly legal to execute what you 've described however since you seem to be bullish on the stock why sell how do you know the price will continue downwards aside from the philosophical reasoning there can be significant downside to selling shares when you 're expecting to repurchase them in the near future i.e. you will lose your cost basis date which determines whether or not your trade is short term less than 1 year or long term this cost basis term will begin once you repurchase the shares if you are trying to tax harvest and match against some short term gains tax loss harvesting prior to long term treatment may be suitable otherwise your reasoning and reconsider the sale at all since you are bullish remember if you could pick where stock prices are headed in the short term with any degree of certainty you are literally one of a kind on this planet   in addition do remember that in a tax deferred account e.g. ira the term of your trade is typically meaningless but your philosophical reasoning for selling should still be examined

i appreciate having an attorney ’s thoughts   clearly we have different optics   mine is as a consumer who has never actively sought out being a member of a class in a class action suit but have had it on me in each case the settlement was either a very nominal amount e.g. $ or a coupon or credit for future services from the company that allegedly had wronged me   in virtually each settlement the attorneys got handsome fees and the firms were protected from future similar suits from anyone who had not gone through the process of opting out    in one case however i and all other members of the class except the lead plaintiffs i presume were to get nothing while the attorneys were to get literally a half a dollars   the notion was that members of the class had eaten the evidence the same evidence that somehow justified $ compensation to the lawyers   of course you recognize that as the subway foot long sub case where subway was guilty of the monumental crime of selling foot long subs that were not necessarily 12 inches long oh the horror so let me ask you from your optic how do we protect rights while eliminating the incentives for frivolous suits or suits in which the consumer gets nothing of value   and i include the coupon as consumers getting nothing of value as they require the consumer to further patronize the perpetrator of the alleged wrong doing

also almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades    than you would have otherwise would n't the additional trading fees    you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy you forgot to mention taxes rebalancing does or rather can incur costs one way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving these generally are the funds in your retirement accounts in the united states they can be in iras or 401ks they can be regular or roth selling winners withing the structure of the plan does n't trigger capital gains taxes and many have funds within them that have zero loads   another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance for example do n't rebalance at to get back to 60/40 even if it has been two years   given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin    with how do i know whether i 'm selling high and buying low or just    sticking with a losing asset ratio the ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary but your desired ratio is n't arbitrary you selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age your time horizon your goals for the money how comfortable you are with risk as these change during your investing career those ratios would also but they are n't arbitrary   these decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment you could sell computer company x because of how it is performing and buy stock in technology company y because you think it has a better chance of growing that transaction would not be a re balancing selling part of your stock in domestic company a to buy stock in international company b would be part of a re balancing

i would add to this that while everyone is right on trading there are certain special situations you could look into that could turn a profit in a relatively short time frame one month say    a recent example is realty finance i bought in at $ prior to a spinoff sold half the spinoff company at $ within a month and the other half the reit has since paid a 50 cent dividend and gone up to mid $ as well within a total of just over 2 months this admittedly sounds like bragging which is n't i just want to give an example of a short term position resulting in a gain and i do n't know any off the top of my head except the one i did recently    this is n't trading but it is a short term position that would have turned a profit with $ 1800 i still would n't recommend it considering commissions eats a sizable portion but if you want to take short term positions you do n't need as much as you would to be a day trader    i would read seth klarman 's margin of safety the sections on spinoffs and bankruptcy they provide some useful information on some short term positions however also be aware that you should be willing to hold any short term position as a long term position if it does not immediately work out by way of example i believed would go up post spinoff but the spinoff company stay the same instead stayed the same and the spinoff went up but was undervalued so i held it for another month    just my advice as far as learning use play money but if you never are going to have enough money to really trade with hopefully my info on short term positions is helpful

some of the 45,000 might be taxable the question is how was the stipend determined was it based on the days away the mile driven the cities you worked in the irs has guidelines regarding what is taxable in   irs pub 15 per diem or other fixed allowance   you may reimburse your employees by travel days miles or some other    fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure in these    cases your employee is considered to have accounted to you if your    reimbursement does n't exceed rates established by the federal    government the 2015 standard mileage rate for auto expenses was    cents per mile the rate for 2016 is 54 cents per mile the government per diem rates for meals and lodging in the continental    united states can be found by visiting the u.s. general services    administration website at www and entering per diem rates in    the search box other than the amount of these expenses your    employees business expenses must be substantiated for example the    business purpose of the travel or the number of business miles    driven for information on methods see pub 463 if the per diem or allowance paid exceeds the amounts substantiated    you must report the excess amount as wages this excess amount is    subject to income tax with holding and payment of social security    medicare and futa taxes show the amount equal to the substantiated    amount for example the nontaxable portion in box 12 of form w-2    using code l

those choices are n't mutually exclusive   yes most discussion of the mortgage interest deduction ignores the fact that for a standard much if not all of this deduction can be lost   for 2011 the std deduction for a single is $ 5,800 it 's not just mortgage interest that 's deductible state income tax tax and charitable contributions are among the other deductions if this house is worth $ 350 k the property tax is about $ 5 k and since it 's not optional i 'd be inclined to assume that it 's the deduction that offsets the std deduction most states have an income tax which tops off the rest you are welcome to toss this aside as but i view it as these other deductions as lost first   i 'm married and our property tax is more than our standard deduction so when doing the math the mortgage is fully deductible as are our contributions   in your case the numbers may play out differently no state tax great so it 's the property tax and deductions you 'd add up first and decide on the value the mortgage deduction brings   last i do n't have my mortgage for the deduction i just believe that long term my other investments will exceed after tax the cost of that mortgage

from your first link irs.gov ira one rollover per year rule ira one rollover per year rule beginning in 2015 you can make only one rollover from an ira to    another or the same ira in any 12-month period regardless of the    number of iras you own announcement   2014 15 and announcement    2014 32 the limit will apply by aggregating all of an individual ’s    iras including sep and simple iras as well as traditional and roth    iras effectively treating them as one ira for purposes of the limit they are limiting your ability to roll over money from an ira to an ira you are looking to go from a 401 k to an ira that is fine the idea was that some people were taking all money from their ira using it for almost 60 days then putting it back into an ira thus getting a sort of short term loan they could do this multiple times in a year the direct trustee to trustee transfer are exempt from the once per year rule because the money is never in your possession   moving money from a tsp plan from your former employer to an ira or roth ira is fine and is n't limited to once per year

firstly make sure annual income exceeds annual expenses the difference is what you have available for saving   secondly you should have tiers of savings from most to least liquid and least to most rewarding the core of personal finance is managing the flow of money between these tiers to balance maximizing return on savings with budget constraints for example insurance effectively allows society to move money from savings to stocks and bonds and a savings account lets the bank loan out a bit of your money to people buying assets like homes   note that the above set of accounts is just a template from which you should customize you might want to add in an fsa or hsa extra loan payments or taxable brokerage accounts depending on your cash flow debt and tax situation

your analysis is not comparing apples to apples which is why it looks like investing money in a non qualified account is better than a 401k traditional or roth   for the non qual you are using post tax dollars money that has already been taxed now on top of that original tax you are also going to pay capital gains tax for any growth plus dividend rates for any dividends it throws off   for the 401k let 's assume for the moment that $ 10,000 is invested in a traditional and that the marginal tax rate is always 20 and for growth let 's assume 10x with a traditional your money will grow to $ 100,000 and then the irs gets $ 20,000 as you pull the money out the result is a net 80,000 for you   for a roth 401k it is taxed first so only $ 8,000 gets invested this then grows by the same multiplier to $ 80,000 until you consider changing tax rates the roth and traditional give the same growth of money considering the non qual option like with the roth we only have $ 8,000 to invest however in this case you will not realize the full 10x growth as you will have to pay taxes on $ 72,000 these are taxes that the 401ks and also iras do not pay there are other reasons to consider non qual over maxing out your 401k liquidity quality of investments and fees being some of those but the capital gains rate vs. ordinary income rate is not one as the money in the non qual still has to go through that ordinary income tax first before it is available to even invest

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

rent to own is not a precise single agreement it can be whatever the seller and you agree to it 's a unique seller that would agree to this keep in mind most sellers are needing to get their money in full to buy their next house you might find an investor willing to work with you but only for an inflated price interest rate or both   the ideal seller would be underwater owing more than the value of the home but needing to move in which case they are hoping to find someone to buy them some time to get situated in their new house before moving forward with you and the bank to arrange a sale   at its simplest you might pay a premium on your rent to fix the price giving you the option to buy during a particular period at that price   it can be a much higher premium where you are renting and paying extra until you hit 20 at which point you agree to finance the balance either with a bank loan or through the seller   buying a home you will live in is a personal decision with no numbers offered it 's not like we can tell you if it 's a wise purchase

step one contact the collection agency tell them that they have the wrong person and the same name is just a coincidence i would not give them my correct social security number birth date or other identifying information this could be a total scam for the purpose of getting you to give them such personal identifying information so they can perform an identity theft even if it is a legitimate debt collection agency if they are and/or incompetent they may enter your identifying information into their records oh you say your social security number is n't 123 45 but 56 thank you let me update our records now sir i see that the social security number in our records matches your social security number step two if they do n't back off contact a lawyer collection agencies work by call it intimidation or moral persuasion depending on your viewpoint years after my wife left me she went bankrupt a collection agency called me demanding payment of her debts before the bankruptcy went through i noticed two things about this one we were divorced and i had no responsibility for her debts somehow they tracked down my new address and phone number a place where she had never even lived why should i pay her debts i had no legal obligation nor did i see any moral obligation two their pitch was that she i should pay off this debt before the bankruptcy was final why would anyone do that the whole point of declaring bankruptcy is so you do n't have to pay these debts they were hoping to her into paying even though she would n't be legally obligated to pay if you do n't owe the money of course there 's no reason why you should pay it if they continue to pursue you for somebody else 's debt in the u.s. you can sue them for harassment there are all sorts of legal limits on what collection agencies are allowed to do actually even if they do back off it might be worth contacting a lawyer i suspect that asking your employer to garnish your wages without a court order without even proof that you are responsible for this debt is a tort that you could sue them for

senate vs. house health care bills   summarized from   1 reduces   subsidies from eligibility from 400 percent of the   federal poverty line which is a hair under $ 100,000 a year for a family of four to 350 percent of the poverty line which is about $   2 reduces premium subsidies which determines the subsidy level which should cover about 70 percent of anticipated health expenses to one with an actuarial value of 58 percent causing people to opt for plans with higher deductibles to offset effects on the elderly the bill   changes the subsidy formula to account for age   3 obamacare 's   growth subsidy cap on premium subsidies   changed from percent of gdp 0.4 percent of gdp meaning program cap   is more likely to hit cutting subsidies to some groups   4 eliminates the individual and employer mandates   may   destabilize the obamacare exchanges and subsidies   5 restricts the already small abortion coverage   6 ends the cost sharing reductions   that lowered out of pocket expenditures for people making less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line not   funded since republicans took over congress the bill pays the insurers the money they ’ve been owed ending the program makes obamacare significantly less attractive for the folks whose policies are so heavily subsidized   7 states given   a great deal more flexibility expedite waiver program with less interference from federal regulators   8) eliminates many obamacare taxes on everything from to high earners   the cadillac tax on pricey employer sponsored insurance postponed until ending an attempt   to our nation ’s hog wild tax subsidies for employer sponsored insurance   presumably senators are keeping the tax in after doing so reduces the apparent cost of a full repeal   9 market stabilization funds designed   to keep the dreaded death spiral from happening by dealing with the major problem driving costs on the exchanges very sick people   details on this are sketchy because states are expected to design programs to meet the goal   if it works it has the potential to substantially improve the sustainability of the exchanges   10 winds down the medicaid expansion funding but not as fast as the house bill    11 it also makes people below the poverty threshold eligible to buy exchange policies with subsidies this coverage is not as generous as medicaid it will probably involve substantial deductibles and but the premiums are capped at 2 percent of family income which for a single person making exactly the federal poverty line would be about $ 20 a month    12 converts medicaid to a per capita allotment rather than an open ended entitlement   like the house bill the senate bill changes the program to a per beneficiary grant based on previous spending levels   it ’s not the block granting of supply dreams but it ’s close this will give states heavy incentives to keep program growth in check especially with future payment growth will be indexed to general inflation rather than the higher medical inflation states can also apply to switch to a block grant formula or to implement a work requirement for medicaid recipients

if you mean if i invest say $ 1000 in a stock that is growing at 5 per year versus investing $ 1000 in an account that pays compound interest of 5 per year how does the amount i have after 5 years compare then the answer is they would be exactly the same   as kent anderson says compound interest simply means that as you accumulate interest that for the next interest cycle the amount that they pay interest on is based on the previous cycle balance plus the interest for example suppose you invest $ 1000 at 5 interest compounded annually after one year you get 5 of $ 1000 or $ 50 you now have $ 1050 at the end of the second year you get 5 of $ 1050 not 5 of the original $ 1000 or $ so you now have $ etc stocks tend to grow in the same way but here 's the big difference if you get an interest bearing account the bank or investment company guarantees the interest rate unless they go bankrupt you will get that percentage interest but there is absolutely no guarantee when you buy stock it may go up 5 this year up 4 next year and down 3 the year after the company makes no promises about how much growth the stock will show it may show a loss it all depends on how well the company does

in a simple world yes but not in the real world option pricing is n't that simplistic in real life generally option pricing uses a monte carlo simulation of the black scholes formula binomial and then plot them to decide the optimum price of the option primarily multiple scenarios are generated and under that specific scenario the option is priced and then a price is derived for the option in real life using the prices which were predicted in the scenarios   so you do n't generate a single price for an option because you have to look into the future to see how the price of the option would behave under the real elements of the market so what you price is an assumption that this is the most likely value under my scenarios which i predicted into the future because of the market if you price an option higher lower than another competitor you introduce an option for arbitrage by others so you try to be as close to the real value of the option which your competitor also does the more closer your option value is to the real price the better it is for all did you try the book from hull edit while pricing you generally take variables which would affect the price of your option the more variables you nearer you are to the real situation the more realistic your price will be and you would converge on the real price faster so simple formula is an option but the deviations maybe large from the real value and you would end up loosing money most of the time so the complicated formula is there for getting a more accurate price not to confuse people you can use your formula but there will be odds stacked against you to loose money from the onset because you did n't consider the variables which might would affect the price of your option

definitely not   you are too young   let me explain your money will be locked up for at least 40 years and you will have to navigate some really and trap laden rules in order to get money for simple things   let 's say you want to buy a house   you wo n't be able to leverage the 401 k for that   college tuition   limits your money is locked in and you may get some match but that assumes your smartest decision at your age is to save money for retirement   at your age you should be investing in your career and that requires cash at hand   if you want to withdraw early you pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate    put differently investing in your human capital at a young age can yield stronger results than just money   i 'd say do n't worry until you are 30 btw i 'm 24 now   i used to save money in a 401 k for a few months before i understood the rules   since then i decided against 401 k and just saved the money in a bank   after a few years i had enough to start my business   the 401 k could n't give me that opportunity further explanation i am in the nyc area   many of my friends and i had to decide between living in manhattan or choosing to live in the outer or nj   one thing i noticed was that while the people in manhattan were burning much more money to the tune of 1500 per month they were actually much more productive and were promoted more often   having lived in brooklyn and in manhattan even though it is less expensive you actually lose at least an hour a day thanks to the commute and have to deal with crap like the 6 train   personally after moving in i invested the extra time in myself i.e. sleeping more working longer hours side projects   now when all is said and done the people who decided to invest in themselves in the short term are financially more secure both job wise and economically thanks to a few bonus cycles than those who decided to save on rent and put it in a 401k. as far as the traps are concerned my dad tried to take out a student loan and was denied thanks to a vanguard which did nt allow more than 50 k to be borrowed even though the account had over 500 k to begin with

this might be a bit of r conspiracy thinking but   dol rule has altered investment companies ability to make money on accounts many are still struggling to figure out how to adopt monitor and be in compliance with it this will hit the insurance companies hard too especially variable annuities providers since it is that much more difficult to justify their high cost products for rollovers dol    if you reduce the limit to 2,400 people are going to have to find other places to put money to continue to save   if you already saving 18,000 or 10,000 or 5,000 a year your going to need a new place to put that money   what other products are there that are tax deferred for non money after tax annuities    and since these dollars are no longer in qualified plans they are not subjected to the dol rules     if a variable annuity company comes out with a hybrid qualified non qualified account that allows you to have one contract with two accounts in it the fix is in   so maybe the insurance companies or the financial services companies lobbying groups or supported think tanks came up with the idea and served it to the government    my tin foil hat is on

i was wondering why equity is reflecting ownership of the issuing entity   that is the definition of equity in this regard my understanding is that for a stock equity its issuing entity is a company firm that sells the stock equity while its receiving entity is an investor that buys the stock equity correct equity reflects ownership of the receiving entity i.e. investor incorrect equity reflects ownership by the receiving entity of the issuing entity that is when you buy stock in a company taking an equity stake in the company you buy a piece of the company   it would be rather odd for the company to own a piece of you when you buy their stock

others have pointed out that many benefits offered by employers for free are actually taxed the employee must pay taxes on the value of what they 're receiving usually services of some kind this is called imputed income also pointed out was that healthcare is an exception a specifically protected class of benefits that are n't taxed but sometimes they are many companies now offer domestic partner health coverage as well regardless of whether the couple is in any kind of civil union or other arrangement the costs to the employee vary but it 's often that they simply pay double of what their individual coverage contribution would be independent of the employee 's direct contribution for their domestic partner they must also pay taxes on the value of the employer 's cost of the coverage this can be significant as typically the employer is paying the lion 's share of the healthcare cost

tax is often calculated per item   especially in the days of the internet some items are taxable and some are n't depending on the item and your nexus   i would recommend calculating and storing tax with each item to account for these subtle differences edit not sure why this was downvoted if you do n't believe me you can always check with amazon i think they know what they 're talking about final update now if someone goes to your site and buys something from your business in california and the shipping address for the product is nevada then taxes do not have to be collected   if they have a billing address in california and a shipping address in nevada and the goods are shipping to nevada you do not have to declare tax if you have a mixture of tangible computer mouse keyboard and intangible assets warranty in a cart and the shipping address is in california you charge tax on the tangible assets but not on the intangible assets yes you can charge tax on the whole order   yes for most businesses that 's good enough but i 'm not trying to provide the good enough solution i 'm simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate   as i 've mentioned i 've done several tax using software called google if you 've not heard of it and have done those for companies like the bbc and owned and operated by bill gates take it or leave it but the correct way to charge taxes especially given the complex tax laws of the us and internationally is to charge per item   if you just need the good enough approach feel free to calculate it by total some additional reading another possible federal limitation on internet taxation is the united states supreme court case corp. v. north dakota 504 u.s. which held that under the dormant commerce clause goods purchased through mail order can not be subject to a state ’s sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state the tax   in 1997 the federal government decided to limit taxation of internet activity for a period of time the internet tax freedom act prohibits taxes on internet access which is defined as a service that allows users access to content information email or other services offered over the internet and may include access to proprietary content information and other services as part of a package offered to customers the act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods

i find it interesting that you did n't include something like total bond or intermediate term in your graphic    if someone were to have just invested in the dji or sp500 then they would have ignored the tenants of the modern portfolio theory and not diversified adequately   i would n't have been able to stomach a portfolio of 100 stocks commodities or metals   my vote goes for 1 picking an asset allocation that reflects your tolerance for risk a good starting point is age in bonds i.e. if you 're 30 then hold 30 in bonds 2 save as if you 're not expecting annualized returns of 10 for example and save more 3 do n't try to pick the next winner instead broadly invest in the market and hold it   maybe gold and silver are bubbles soon to burst i for one do n't know   i do n't give the notion in the investment community much weight as it always is someday someone will be right i just do n't know who that someone is

it seems very risky have all of your net worth in this one home if i were to buy the house i 'm not sure i would put that much down consider 20 and keep cash on hand in retirement assets etc i would look at how much a mortgage plus interest taxes insurance etc would cost with 50 down and with 20 down and see how that impacts your cash flow renting may make more sense it 's hard to tell without more specifics nytimes rent buy calculator is a nice tool but regardless i would not want to have so much net worth tied into one asset and so would opt for less money down if i were to buy focus on rebuilding some retirement assets

bond etfs are just another way to buy a bond mutual fund   an etf lets you trade mutual fund shares the way you trade stocks in small share size increments   the content of this answer applies equally to both stock and bond funds if you are intending to buy and hold these securities your main concerns should be purchase fees and expense ratios   different brokerages will charge you different amounts to purchase these securities   some brokerages have their own mutual funds for which they charge no trading fees but they charge trading fees for etfs   brokerage a will let you buy brokerage a 's mutual funds for no trading fee but will charge a fee if you purchase brokerage b 's mutual fund in your brokerage a account some brokerages have multiple classes of the same mutual fund   for example vanguard for many of its mutual funds has an investor class minimum $ 3,000 initial investment admiral class minimum $ 10,000 initial investment and an etf share price as initial investment   investor class has the highest expense ratio er   admiral class and the etf generally have much lower er usually the same number   for example vanguard 's total bond market index mutual fund has investor class symbol vbmfx with er admiral symbol with 0.06 er and etf symbol with 0.06 er same as admiral   see vanguard etf mutual fund comparison page   note that you can initially buy investor class shares with vanguard and vanguard will automatically convert them to the lower er admiral class shares when your investment has grown to the admiral threshold choosing your broker and your funds may end up being more important than choosing the form of mutual fund versus etf   some brokers charge very high purchase redemption fees for mutual funds   many brokers have no etfs that they will trade for free   between funds index funds are passively managed and are just designed to track a certain index they have lower   actively managed funds are run by managers who try to beat the market they have higher and tend to actually fall below the performance of index funds a double whammy see also vanguard 's explanation of mutual funds vs. etfs at vanguard see also investopedia 's explanation of mutual funds vs. etfs in general

generally speaking if the acquiring company buys less than 50 of the target the acquirer would not claim any income until there was a dividend or the equity stock appreciated with a dividend the company would participate in and book earnings on the cash received without a dividend equity stock of the target should theoretically rise to reflect higher retained income and the acquirer would book an unrealized gain to gross profit i think if the acquiring company buys more than 50 of the target it is likely all revenues and would be consolidated and included in the acquiring company 's respective accounts as if it was one whole any residual stake in the target owned by a third party would be reflected in a minority interest expense on the acquiring company 's income statement

is your name on the title at all you may have slightly more leverage in that case but co signing any loans is not a good idea even for a friend or relative as this article notes generally co signing refers to financing not ownership if the    primary fails to make payments on the loan or the retail    installment sales contract a type of auto financing dealers sell    the co signer is responsible for those payments or their credit will    suffer even if the co signer makes the payments they ’re still not    the owner if their name is n’t on the title the consumer finance protection bureau cfpb notes if you co sign a loan you are legally obligated to repay the loan in    full co signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference    for someone else   when you co sign you promise to pay the loan yourself it means that    you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately if the    borrower defaults on the loan the creditor can use the same    collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower    such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself suing you    and your wages or bank accounts after a judgment your    credit may be impacted by any late payments or defaults co signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the    vehicle it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to    repay the amount of the loan so make sure you can afford to pay this    debt if the borrower can not per this article and this article options to remove your name from co signing include if you 're name is n't on the title you 'll have to convince your ex boyfriend and the bank to have you removed as the co signer but from your brief description above it does n't seem that your ex is going to be cooperative unfortunately as the co signer and guarantor of the loan you 're legally responsible for making the payments if he does n't not making the payments could ruin your credit as well one final option to consider is bankruptcy bankruptcy is a drastic option and you 'll have to weigh whether the disruption to your credit and financial life will be worth it versus repaying the balance of that auto loan per this post another not so pretty option is bankruptcy this is an extreme route    and in some instances may not even guarantee a name removal from the    loan your best bet is to contact a lawyer or other source of legal help to review your options on how to proceed with this issue

you should have separate files for each of the two businesses   the business that transfers money out should write check in its qb file   the business that receives money should make deposit in its qb file in qb you write check even when you make the payment by some other means like ach   neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented    on each side you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from gone to some other account to know what 's correct there we 'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established   i think that 's probably beyond the scope of what 's on topic feasible here money into your business from your personal account is probably owner 's equity unless you have something else going on   for example on the s corp you should be paying yourself a salary   if you overpay by accident then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake   that 's not equity it 's probably a negative expense in some other account that tracks the salary payments

if you are worried about an increase in volatility then go long volatility volatility itself can be traded here in the us there is an index vix that is described as tracking volatility what vix actually tracks is the premium of s&p 500 options which become more expensive when traders want to hedge against volatility in the us you can trade vix options or invest in vix tracking etfs like vxx apparently there are similar etfs listed in canada such as volatility itself is quite volatile so it is possible that a small volatility long position would cover the losses of a larger long position in stocks if you do choose to invest in a volatility etf be aware that they experience quite a lot of decay you will not want to hold it for very long

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

dividend prices are per share so the amount that you get for a dividend is determined by the number of shares that you own and the amount of the dividend per share that 's all people like to look at dividend yield because it lets them compare different investments that 's done by dividing the dividend by the value of the stock however determined that 's the percentage that the question mentions a dividend of $ 1 per share when the share price is $ 10 gives a 10 dividend yield a dividend of $ 2 per share when the share price is $ 40 gives a 5 dividend yield if you 're choosing an investment the dividend yield gives you more information than the amount of the dividend

answered why platinum is in demand like it is   but it missed some of the significant risks so i will address some of them   platinum is much more rare than gold   but not because there is less platinum than gold just that the known existing platinum are smaller and more disbursed   so if a large vein were found it could have a significant impact on the availability and thus reducing price of platinum   new mining technologies are being developed every day   one of these could make platinum from existing not platinum mines easier and more cost effective again increasing the availability and reducing the price of platinum the vast majority of platinum use today is for emissions controls   there is a lot of money being thrown into research on green energy and technologies   one of these technologies or a side effect of other research could result in much more cost effective ways to combat emissions   should that happen i would expect the price of platinum to fall through the floor and potentially never recover i do not think any of these scenarios are imminent but the risks that they present are so great it is important to consider them before investing

you are doing great but you might want to read a couple of books and do some studying on budgeting and personal finance education yourself now and you will avoid pain in the future i learned a lot from reading dave ramsey 's total money makeover and i have found some great advice from the simple budgeting guidelines on budget in these three categories with these percentages you may find that your essentials lower than 50 because you are sharing room and utilities you want to put as much into financial as you can for the first 1 2 years to reduce or eliminate your student loan debt many folks will recommend you save six months salary expenses for emergencies and unexpected situations but understand that you are in debt now and you have a unique opportunity to pay off your debt before your living expenses creep up as they so often do since you are a contractor put aside 2 months expenses twice what i would normally advise and then attack paying off your debts with passion since you have a mix of student loans focus on paying them off by picking one at a time paying the minimum against the others while you pay off the one you picked then proceed to the next dave ramsey advises a debt snowball paying the smallest one first psychological advantage early wins while others advise paying the highest interest off first since you have over $ available to pay down debt you could plan on reducing your student loan debt substantially in a year   but avoid accumulating other debt along the way save for larger purchases your bedroom purchase may have been premature but you needed some basics but check your contract since many 0 furniture loan deals retroactively charge interest if you do n't pay them off in full you might want to make regular payments and pay the debt off a month early avoid any gotcha 's you might want to open a retirement account many folks recommend a roth account for folks your age it is after tax but you do n't pay tax when you withdraw money roth is better when you have lots of deductions think mortgage kids but some retirement account would be great to get started open a credit union account if you can that will make getting a credit card or personal loan installment easier you want to build a credit file but you do n't want credit card debt seems contradictory so opening 2 credit cards over the next year will help your credit you want a good credit mix student loans revolving installment and mortgage wait on that one

they 're not going to look very hard at the asset value except for actual cash in the bank which does n't bear much relationship to the real value of the company more likely they will look at the last three years earnings and choose a target p e ratio based on that the owner 's share depends entirely on how much of the business they choose to sell if the business is worth $ 60 m and they want to raise $ 20 m for themselves then that means selling 33 of the company if they want to raise $ 20 m for the business as well then that means selling half the company and retaining ownership of the other half which is now worth $ 80 m because of the cash infusion but many stock exchanges will have minimum requirements for the percentage of the shares that are trading freely so they will have to sell at least that much

oh i see what you mean it depends which side you look at it from the company or the individual investor   for the individual investor i guess it does n't matter as you said you only buy the amount of stocks you can afford what matters afterwards is whether the price of your stocks goes up or down that 's when the company valuation comes into play if a company is overvalued the stock prices are going to go down until they reach the equilibrium wiki or stocks go down when more people will want to sell than buy creating an excess supply so sellers will be willing to offer lower prices so you buy from them stocks go up when the opposite happens more people will want to buy than sell so buyers will have to offer more money to convince sellers to sell   in essence facebook was overvalued and not enough people were buying their shares creating excess supply so sellers had to offer lower prices had facebook been properly valued people would've felt the stocks were a good price everyone would've rushed to purchase and stock prices would've gone up

i am using my debit card regularly in atm 's with a pin in stores with my signature and online but later you say   but from what i recall from starting my own business a long time ago for debit cards there 's only a per transaction fee of like $ 0.25 not a percentage cut only pin transactions have just a per transaction fee paid by you to the merchant and you are reimbursed by schwab   if you use your card with just a signature or online without a pin then it is a credit transaction from the merchant 's perspective   the merchant pays a fee and schwab gets its cut of that   so for two of the transaction types that you describe the merchant pays schwab indirectly out of your payment   only when you enter your pin does it process as a debit transaction where schwab pays the merchant    because check cards withdraw the money from your account immediately you do n't even get the twenty to fifty day grace period   so those merchant fees are pure profit for schwab offsetting the loss from the atm fees    you claim $ 4 5k in fees at $ .25 each   that 's sixteen to twenty thousand transactions   assuming that several is four to five years that 's more than ten transactions a day   that seems like a lot   i can see three for meals one for miscellaneous and maybe some shopping   but if i go shopping one day i do n't normally go again for a while   i have trouble seeing a consistent average of five or more transactions a day    even if we use just the higher atm fees e.g. $ 2 that 's still more than a transaction a day   that 's an extreme level of usage particularly for someone who also makes frequent purchases via card    i have n't done any other business with them i find this confusing   how does money get into your account   at some point you must have deposited money into the account   you ca n't debit from an account without a positive balance   so you must have done or be doing some kind of business with them   if nothing else they can invest the balance that you deposit   note that they make a profit off such investments   they share some of that profit with you in the form of interest but not that much really    of course schwab may still be losing money on your transactions   we ca n't really tell without more information on how much of each transaction type you do and how much of a balance you maintain   perhaps they are hoping that you will do other more profitable activities in the future    i doubt there are that many schwab customers like you describe yourself   as best i 've been able to see they advertise their banking services just to investment customers   so it 's unlikely that many customers who do n't use their investment services use their banking services just for atm reimbursements

one snag in your plan is that you alone ca n't undo your hsa contributions because you would also owe fica taxes on that amount and those need to be paid by both you and your employer the only way for that to happen is for your employer to undo your hsa contributions from their point of view so those wages can be entirely taxed with both fica and regular withholding how that is accomplished will probably be up to them it could mean you pulling the money out of the hsa account and then either giving it back to your employer so they can re allocate it with a new check or if you have enough pay due between now and the end of the year you could keep the money and they can reduce your next by the total additional taxes due note that you should prefer the latter if possible since this way you would get to keep the $ 1000 you should n't have gotten in the first place also note that when you withdraw the money from your hsa account you need to inform your bank that you are undoing the contributions rather than taking distributions and likely fill out a form if you do n't inform them they will improperly report to the irs that you had contributions and an equal amount of distributions which could muddy the waters with also having an fsa

without knowing the terms of the company leased car it 's hard to know if that would be preferable to purchasing a car yourself so i 'll concentrate on the two purchase options getting a loan or paying in full from savings if the goal is simply to minimize the amount paid for this car then paying the full cost up front is best because it avoids the financing and interest charges associated with a loan however the money you would pay for this car would come out of somewhere your savings if your savings were in an investment earning a risk adjusted return rate of say 5 apy and the loan cost 1 apy you 'd have more money in the long run by keeping as much money in your savings as possible and paying the loan as slowly as possible because the return rate on your savings is higher those numbers are theoretical of course you have to make a decision based on your expectation of the performance of your investments and on the cost of the loan but depending on your risk tolerance and the loan terms available to you a loan may well make sense this is especially true when loans costs are subsidized by manufacturers who often offer favorable financing on new cars to drive demand but even bank loans on cars can be pretty inexpensive because the car is a form of collateral with predictable future value and finally you should consider tax treatment not usually a consideration in purchases of cars by consumers in the us but can vary due to business use and certainly may be different in india see also how smart is it to really be 100 debt free

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

great effort on the question all i can advise is if paypal does not provide the mapping table type status credit debit you will have to build it up yourself as you go along i would tackle it this way your sql mapping table has credit debit entries for all knows combinations and the credit debit entry would be -1 for all then as you get a list of transactions you will have to display all possible results to the user who will then tick the correct one comparing it to the balance you would store the credit debit entry if it is unique this way you will learn what the possible combinations are over time its a to the problem so maybe start with a small number of transactions first i expect you can build up pretty quickly it will be an interesting experiment

i know i 'm late to the party but a couple of as a recent bitcoin advocate i may be out of place in this subreddit as i come from a primarily technological background not a financial one    gt is not a currency it 's a store of value because it is not widely accepted as tender by most people   bitcoin is not a currency yet but because it does not have widespread adoption like other revolutionary technologies there is an inflection bitcoin adoption price where adoption goes from hardly anyone to almost everyone very quickly example   gt;even as a store of value it 's not very good it 's volatile and the fact that there is a limited supply of bitcoin is not a good thing sure in the short run it results in speculation that drives up the price of a coin and makes it all the rage among gamblers but i do n't think anyone can explain how if used on a larger scale would n't lead to deflation in the price of goods   to me this is basic supply and demand and it would in theory become less volatile and more stable following mass adoption bitcoin has virtually no inflation and i agree that this could lead to the deflation of goods but only insofar as that valuation is determined in bitcoin for example milk is still $ 2 but as the value of bitcoin fluctuates i may pay .001 btc or btc for that milk it 's important to remember we 're dealing with a digital asset in an increasingly more world a point of sale device like we use for credit cards could certainly tackle that conversion in the future    gt;also at the end of the day fiat currencies are based on trust and accountability of the government how does bitcoin or any other online currency solve that problem there 's no accountability and it effectively acts as as an anti currency fueled by mistrust in the establishment   this is the best part of bitcoin understanding the incentives if you follow that supply and demand logic then it is in the best interest of everyone who uses bitcoin that the bitcoin software and the system itself be reliable and secure the software is open source so anyone can see how it works and where its flaws and weaknesses are and it is still standing strong after 8 years the biggest weakness so far has been in software updates and changes to the core protocol without any central structure i.e. accountability it can be slow to reach a democratic consensus is such a way that does n't split the blockchain or the network this has led to some of the recent extreme volatility    bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies have tremendous potential to disrupt existing financial institutions the private blockchains by banks are at this point just watch?v = = at some point these institutions will realize that they ca n't create their own facebook they need to find ways to become part of the new facebook market

your friend would have only been liable for a tax penalty if he withdrew more 529 money than he reported for qualified expenses    that said if he took the distribution in his name it triggers a report to the irs in his name rather than his beneficiaries   this will likely be flagged by the irs since it looks like he withdrew the money but did n't pay taxes and penalties on it not the beneficiary   in other words qualified education expenses only apply to the beneficiary not the plan owner contributor   in this case the irs would request additional documentation to show that the expenses were indeed qualified    to avoid this hassle it 's easiest to make sure the distribution is payed directly to the beneficiary rather than yourself   once he or she has the check then have them sign the check over to you or transfer it into your account   otherwise you trigger an irs in your name rather than your beneficiary

as you mentioned in the title what you 're asking about comes down to volatility   dca when purchasing stock is one way of dealing with volatility but it 's only profitable if the financial instrument can be sold higher than your sunk costs   issues to be concerned with let 's suppose you 're buying a stock listed on the nyse called foo this is a completely fake example   over the last six days the average value of this stock was exactly $ 1   over six trading days you put $ 100 per day into this 2 at market close on january 11th you have shares of foo   you paid $ for it so your average cost before fees is $ = $ per share let 's look at this including your trading fees $ + $ 30 = $ 1.01 per share when the market opens on january 12th the quote on foo could be anything   patents customer wins wars politics lawsuits press coverage etc could cause the value of foo to fluctuate   so let 's just roll with the assumption that past performance is consistent selling foo at $ 0.80 nets $ 0.80 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ loss selling foo at $ 1.20 nets $ 1.20 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ profit every day that you keep trading foo those numbers get bigger assuming foo is a constant value   also remember even if foo never changes its average value and volatility your recoverable profits shrink with each transaction because you pay $ 5 in fees for every one speaking from experience it is very easy to paper trade   it is a lot harder when you 're looking at the ticker all day when foo has been $ 0.80 $ 0.90 for the past four days and you 're $ 300 under water on a $ 1000 portfolio   now your mind starts playing nasty games with you if you decide to try this let me give you some free advice unless you have some research such as support resistance information or data on why foo is a good buy at this price let 's be honest you 're gambling with dca not trading end notes

you 're certainly referring to ex post facto laws and while the us is prohibited from passing criminal laws that are retroactive the us supreme court has upheld many tax laws that apply tax code changes retroactively you might ask a similar question on law se for a more thorough treatment of the legalities of congress passing those laws but i will stick to the personal finance portion of the question what this means is that you ca n't expect that the current tax laws will be in force in the future and your investment retirement plans should be as flexible as possible you may wish to have some money in both roth and traditional 401(k accounts you might not want to have millions of dollars in roth accounts because if congress does act to limit the tax benefits of those accounts it will probably be targeting the larger balances if you are valuing tax deductions you should put slightly more weight on deductions that you can take today than deductions that would apply in the future if you do find yourself in trouble because of a retroactive change be sure to consult a tax lawyer that specializes in dealing with the irs to possibly negotiate a settlement for a lower amount than the full tax bill that results from the changes

bloomberg suggests that two fidelity funds hold preferred shares of snapchat inc preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend have lower liquidity and do n't have voting rights because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a non marketable interest in another even if the company is privately held as snapchat is the strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold however may restrict ownership either banning non market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments since ipo is very costly funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through ipo yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in   start ups since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive low cost way for start ups to generate funds to grow the fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares the of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value this implies that fidelity believe that the total npv of the company 's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated this probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case   of snapchat edit by the way since there is no market for start up stocks pre ipo my heart sinks a little every time i read the title of this question i 'm going to be sad all day now

convenience and of course money in case of an event you 'll have to spend the full worth of money to fix replace while if you 're insured you get the insurance to pay for it it is up to you to decide if the money saved on the lower premiums worth the risk of paying much more in case of an event of course the cheaper the car the more it makes sense not to pay the premiums many people do that regarding the bargaining power i actually think that you would pay less if it is not going through insurance than the bill the insurance pays i fixed a nasty dent for like $ 300   at one shop while at the other they said it 's $ 1200 but what do you care your insurance will cover it i had $ 500 deductible so in the end it was cheaper for me to pay $ 300 without the insurance at all

in a retirement portfolio is usually a function of your age and your risk tolerance your portfolio is usually a mix of the following asset classes you can break down these asset classes further but each one is a topic unto itself if you are young you want to invest in things that have a higher return but are more volatile because market fluctuations like the current financial meltdown will be long gone before you reach retirement age   this means that at a younger age you should be investing more in stocks and foreign developing countries if you are older you need to be into more conservative investments bonds money market etc   if you were in your and still heavily invested in stock something like the current financial crisis could have ruined your retirement plans   a lot of baby boomers learned this the hard way for most of your life you will probably be somewhere in between these two   start aggressive and gradually get more conservative as you get older   you will probably need to re check your asset allocation once every 5 years or so as for how much of each investment class there are no hard and fast rules   the idea is to maximize return while accepting a certain amount of risk   there are two big unknowns in there 1 how much return do you expect from the various investments and 2 how much risk are you willing to accept   1 is a big guess and 2 is personal opinion a general portfolio guideline is 100 minus your age   this means if you are 20 you should have 80 of your retirement portfolio in stocks   if you are 60 your retirement portfolio should be 40 stock   over the years the 100 number has varied   some financial advisor types have suggested 150 or 200   unfortunately that 's why a lot of baby boomers ca n't retire now above all re balance your portfolio regularly   at least once a year perhaps quarterly if the market is going wild   make sure you are still in line with your desired asset allocation   if the stock market tanks and you are under invested in stocks buy more stock selling off other funds if necessary   i 've read interviews with fund managers who say failure to rebalance in a down stock market is one of the big mistakes people make when managing a retirement portfolio as for specific mutual fund suggestions i 'm not going to do that because it depends on what your 401k or ira has available as investment options   i do suggest that your focus on selecting a passive index fund not an actively managed fund with a high expense ratio personally i like total market funds to give you the broadest allocation of small and big companies   this makes your question about large small cap stocks moot   the next best choice would be an s&p 500 index fund you should also be able to find a low cost bond index fund that will give you a healthy mix of different bond types however you need to look at expense ratios to make an informed decision   a better performing fund is pointless if you lose it all to fees also watch out for overlap between your fund choices   investing in both a total market fund and an s&p 500 fund undermines the idea of a diversified portfolio an aggressive portfolio usually includes some foreign developing nation investments   there are n't many index fund options here so you may have to go with an actively managed fund with a much higher expense ratio   however this kind of investment can be worth it to take advantage of the economic growth in places like china

there is no unique identifier that exists to identify specific shares of a stock just like money in the bank there is no real reason to identify which exact dollar bills belong to me or you so long as there is a record that i own x bills and i can access them when i want of course unlike banks there is still a 1:1 relationship between the amount i should own and the amount they actually hold if i may reach a bit the question that i assume you are asking is how are shared actually tracked transferred and recorded so that i know for certain that i traded you 20 microsoft shares yesterday and they are now officially yours given that it 's all digital while you can technically try and request a physical share certificate it 's very cumbersome to handle and transfer in that form   ownership of shares themselves are tracked for brokerage firms in the case of retail trading which i assume is the context of this question as we 're discussion personal finance your broker has a record of how many shares of x y and z you own when you bought each share and for how much and while you are the beneficial owner of record you get dividends voting rights etc your brokerage is the one who is holding the shares when you buy or sell a stock and you are matched with a counterparty the process of which is beyond the scope of this question then a process of settlement comes into play in the us settlement takes 3 working days to process and technically ownership does not transfer until the 3rd day after the trade is made though things like margin accounts will allow you to effectively act as if you own the shares immediately after a buy sell order is filled settlement in the us is done by a sole source the depository trust clearing corporation this is where retail and institutional trade all go to be sorted checked and confirmed and ultimately returned to the safekeeping of their new owners representatives your brokerage interestingly the is also the central custodian for shares both physical and virtual and that is where the shares of stock ultimately reside

walmart 's success is built on the backs of these so called low skill workers last time i checked walmart was making huge profits every quarter so maybe the people who are doing all of the hard work deserve a living wage also there are several trained skills walmart employees have for example to work in produce and the deli you have to be trained in safe food practices a walmart employee also has to have time management skills employees are often are assigned multiple tasks in several departments also the computer systems must be learned if i handed you a i doubt you would be able to check to see if an item was in stock and if it was n't how to order a new one also anyone can be a cashier but can anyone be a fast efficient cashier you are also putting your body at risk especially when you are tasked with unloading trucks or stocking shelves several of my ex coworkers have work related injuries the most common are bad knees backs and shoulders in short if every walmart worker in the nation went on strike walmart would find it impossible to find enough skilled workers to fill their rolls sure they could replace them easily but it would take months for the new employees to learn the necessary skills and while they are learning walmart would have incredibly long lines and lots of unsatisfied customers   in an unrelated note please excuse any spelling or formatting errors i am typing this on my phone

i ca n't think of any conceivable circumstance in which the banker 's advice would be true edit actually yes i can but things have n't worked that way since so his information is a little stale credit bureaus got their start by only reporting information about bad debtors the bureaus only store on your file what gets reported to them by the institution who extended you the credit this reporting tends to happen at 30 60 or 90-day intervals depending on the contract the bureau has with that institution all credit accounts are real from the day you open them i suspect the banker might be under the misguided impression the account does n't show up on your report become real until you miss a payment which forces the institution to report it but this is the institution wo n't report it until the 30-day mark at the earliest whether or not you miss a payment or pay it in full the cynic in me suspects this banker might give customers such advice to sabotage their credit so he can sell them higher interest loans laws were created for a reason

you can illustrate why expense ratio fees are in the numerator with an extreme example   let 's say you have $ 100 in a mutual fund their expense ratio is 50 your nominal return is 900 and inflation is 900   thus without the expense your investment would give you $ 100 in present value because your return and inflation are identical and $ 1000 in future value   so with the expense ratio of 50 and no change in present value you can reason that you would expect the expense ratio will eat half the present value   if you apply your equation and include expenses in the numerator you end up with   100 + + 9 = $ 50 present value as you would expect   if you apply the manager 's assumption that fees are applied external to inflation then you end up with   100 1 + + 9 100 1 + 9 .50 = $ present value   with this example you can see applying the fees externally acts as though they are charging you the fees on future returns today   edit   it 's probably not worth fighting with someone senior to you over as inflation rates are noisy estimates to begin with and the difference between these is typically not material to the decision being made but pissing off someone senior by showing them their math is off will probably have a material impact on you

after a bit of rooting around the hmrc sites i found this page which says this one key difference is that products are classed as electronically supplied services for vat and customs duties these services are for vat purposes the place of supply of these services is the country in which the customer lives if you supply electronic services to a business customer in another european union eu country the customer accounts for any vat due in that country you should not charge uk vat if you supply electronic services to a consumer charity or government body in another eu country you have to account for uk vat if you supply electronic services to anyone in a country outside the eu you do n't pay any vat if as a uk business you buy electronic services from a company outside the uk you have to account for vat if i read this correctly i as the supplier of the website need to account for vat only if the sponsor is a consumer charity or government body in another eu country it is not covered in this site but i assume i must also account for vat for a customer based in the uk   so in answer to the original question a customer from canada which is currently outside the eu would account for the vat themselves and i would simply charge the gross amount

first i would recommend getting rid of this ridiculous debt or remember this day and this answer you will be living this way for many years to come and maybe worse no not enough retirement   hold off on any retirement savings right now so that the money can be used to crush this debt without knowing all of your specifics health insurance deductions etc and without any retirement contribution given $ 190,000 you should probably be taking home around $ 12,000 per month total   assuming a $ 2,000 mortgage payment 30 year term that is $ 10,000 left per month   if you were serious about paying this off you could easily live off of $ 3,000 per month probably less and have $ 7,000 left to throw at the student loan debt   this assumes that you have n't financed automobiles especially expensive ones or have other significant debt payments that 's around 3 years until the entire $ 300,000 is paid i have personally used and endorse the snowball method pay off smallest to largest regardless of interest rate though i did adjust it slightly to pay off some debts first that had a very high monthly payment so that i would then have this large payment to throw at the next debt after the debt is gone you now have the extra $ 7,000 per month probably more if you get raises bonuses etc to enjoy and start saving for retirement and kid 's college   you may have 20 25 years to save for retirement at $ 4,000 per month that 's $ 1 million in just savings not including the growth with moderate growth this could easily double or more   you 'll also have about 14 years to save for college for this one kid at $ 1,500 per month that 's $ 250,000 not including investment growth this is probably overkill for one kid so adjust accordingly then there 's at least $ 1,500 per month left to pay off the mortgage in less than half the time of the original term so in this scenario conservatively you might have obviously i do n't know your financials or circumstances so build a good budget and play with the numbers   if you sacrifice for a short time you 'll be way better off trust me from experience as a side note   assuming the loan debt is 50/50 you and your husband you made a good investment and he made a poor one   unless he is a public or charity attorney why is he making $ 60,000 when you are both attorneys and both have huge student loan debt   if it were me i would consider a job change   at least until the debt was cleaned up   if he can make $ 100,000 to $ 130,000 or more then your debt may be gone in under 2 years   then he can go back to the charity gig

anything over a $ 10,000 deposit is reported to the irs i 'm not sure if you need to fill out a form or if the bank does it automatically as long as it 's legit i do n't see that there would be any issues the worst that would happen is somebody would have to talk to the irs and explain that it was their money and not a   gift of some sort edit it is reported to the fincen not the irs

in general i would recommend to stay away from any video from a successful trader at least those that claim to share their secrets if they were that successful why would they want company   what they have most likely discovered is that they can make more money through videos and seminars than they can through trading while not a video has a good basic section on stock markets without being purely canada centric as i see from your profile you are in ny i know that also in our city there are continuing education courses that often go over the basics like this if you have a college nearby they might have something cheapest of all would be to hit your local library   the fundamentals do n't change that quickly that you need the latest and greatest those are much more likely to be get poor quick schemes good luck

i disagree with i do n't think this is qualified as unreimbursed employee expense for it to qualify it has to be ordinary and necessary and specifically necessary for your employer this is not the case for you as there 's no such necessity from employer 's perspective you can work from your home just as well in fact the expense is your personal as it is your choice not unreimbursed employee expense since your employer did n't even ask you to do it you should clarify this with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in new york

a 15 discount is a 17.6 return 100/85 = for a holding period that 's an average 15.5 days a half month it would be silly to compound this over a year as the numbers are limited   the safest way to do this is to sell the day you are permitted in effect you are betting 12 times a year that the stock wo n't drop 15 in 3 days you can pull data going back decades or as long as your company has been public and run a spreadsheet to see how many times if at all the stock has seen this kind of volatility over 3 day periods even for volatile stocks a 15 move is pretty large you 're likely to find your stock doing this less than once per year it 's also safest to not accumulate too many shares of your company for multiple reasons having to do with risk spreading diversification etc   2 additional points   the brexit just caused the s&p to drop 4 over the last 3 days trading this was a major world event but on average we are down 4 one would have to be very unlucky to have their stock drop 15 over the specific 3 days we are discussing   the dollars at risk are minimal say you make $ 120k yr $ 10k month 15 of this is $ 1500 and you are buying $ worth of stock the gains on average are expected to be $ does n't seem like too much but it 's $ over a years time $ in profit for a maximum $ 1500 at risk at any month 's cycle

again i get it but you ca n't honestly argue that random people or companies deciding which regulation they want to follow is at all good you agreed this time but what about next time the one after that    you can already see this problem you dismissed zoning laws because they are n't comparable but that 's your opinion you apparently think that uber can just decide it does n't like them so does that mean you just get to decide what is and is n't comparable that 's not how this works
