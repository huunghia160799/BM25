you seem to have it right   unless you have a big position having mlp shares in your ira will not cause you any tax hassles   your ira will get a schedule k from the which may be mailed to you but you wo n't need to do anything with that unless you 're over the ubi limit   last i checked that was $ 1000 and you probably wo n't exceed that ubi in principle needs to be evaluated every year so it 's not necessarily a one time event   if your ira does go over the ubi limit your ira not you needs to file a return   in that case contact your custodian and tell them about the schedule k that you got see also my answer here tax consequences of commodity etf the question is about commodity etfs in iras but the part of my answer about ubi applies equally well

first of all it 's not the 1 that run things it is more like the 0.1 they run things because they run the government not because they can not be challenged in the market    we should expect the courts to be less corruptible because their proceedings take place in public whereas the executive bureaucracy and most of the congressional machinations occur behind closed doors deals are made that we have no knowledge of that is where the 0.1 operates they are as afraid of the light of day as    there is usually a cycle of wealth that lasts three or four generations unless that cycle is interrupted by collusion with the government europe 's rich stayed rich because they became the government their thefts were by making them nobility and protecting them with the state    look at the makeup of obama 's inner circle it is the banking nobility those banks and would all be broke now if they had not the government to steal from thee and me to give to them    small government that debates everything in the open will not protect the very rich without government protection their wealth will return to the general pool in three generations

as the other answers suggest there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation amount of equity in your current house cashflow primarily amount of time between purchase and sale if you have a fair amount of equity for example $ 50 k mortgage remaining on a house valued at $ 300 k i 'll propose an option that 's similar to bridge financing place an offer on your new house use some of your equity as part of the down payment eg $ 130 k use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale eg $ 30 k the way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage the proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale you 'll be paying two mortgages and you 'll be responsible for two properties not fun but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this when the sale of your new home closes you 'll be breaking the mortgage on that house when you get the proceeds of the sale it would be a good time to use any lump sum prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house   you 'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break however the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing for this reason this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long eg at least 6 months and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable eg 3 months interest you would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer but you would also have to do your own due diligence remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell if you wo n't have any problems selling your current house quickly bridge financing is likely a better deal if you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell you can consider this approach

this answer is an attempt to answer the actual question posed please keep in mind that this applies specifically to the equifax credit model that mint uses as mentioned in the accepted answer and that different models may react in different ways or not at all as mentioned in the comments the number of total accounts you have does not have much bearing on your overall credit score if you click on mint 's about total accounts link you get the following statement total accounts has a low impact on your score second the way the total accounts score is represented is misleading this is not a count of the total number of accounts you have open but rather how many accounts you have in your total history mint 's under this metric is flat out wrong try to have a good mix of credit lines open to back up the assertion that this is looking at total accounts in your credit history rather than just those that are open my mint report shows 2 open accounts and 7 closed accounts for a total of 9 under the total accounts metric i am plotted smack in the middle of the not bad range right where people with 9 would be plotted so the proper advice here is to just let it be and only open new accounts as you need them as you amass credit history this metric will continue to grow naturally it should never decrease you may ask then why did your overall score decrease when you paid off your student loans most likely because your average age of credit dropped when you closed your loan account if you 're like most people i know your student loan is one of your oldest accounts so closing that account will hurt your score credit age is measured only on your open accounts

it is certainly legal to transfer money between people no matter how often as long as the money is not originally from illegal sources if you are gaining in the process you need to pay taxes on your net gain as on any income but as always taxed income is still income consider the accumulating transaction cost the inherent risk of your friend keeping the money and the risk of the exchange rate going the other way but otherwise it is a simple arbitrage business there are thousands of people who do that all year long at stock exchanges and money markets you might be able to do it more efficient there and you do n't need a friend on the other side for that

when you invest in a single index security you are completely exposed to the risk of that security diversification means spreading the investments so the losses on one side can be compensated by the gains on the other side what you are talking about is one thing called risk more formally known as risk tolerance risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand emphasis added this means that you are willing to accept some losses in order to get a potential bigger return fidelity has this graph   as you can see in the table above the higher the risk tolerance the bigger the difference between the best and worst values that is the variability the right most pie can be one example of an agressive diversified portfolio but this does not mean you should go and buy exactly that security high risk means playing with fire unless you are a professional playing with fire usually leaves people burnt in a financial context this usually means the money is gone recommended reading investopedia risk and diversification the risk reward tradeoff investopedia how to construct a high risk portfolio fidelity guide to diversification kpmg understanding and risk appetite pdf

i would say it 's a bit more complicated than that do you understand what a market maker does   an ecn electronic communication network is a virtual exchange that works with market makers using a rebate structure that works by paying for orders adding liquidity and charges a fee for removing liquidity so liquidity is created by encouraging what are essentially limit orders orders that are outside of the current market price and therefore not immediately these orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them   so direct answer is nyse arca is where market makers do their jobs these market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic when you send an order through your brokerage your broker has a number of options your order can be sent directly to an ecn exchange like nyse arca sent to a market making firm like americas formerly knight capital or is when the broker uses an in house service to execute your trade brokerages must disclose what they do with orders for example etrade 's this is a good graphic showing what happens in general along with the names of some common liquidity providers

to expand a bit on 's answer when i read your question title i assumed that by retirement funds you meant target date funds that are close to their target dates say the 2015 target fund   when i saw that you were referring to all target date funds it occurred to me that examining how such funds modify their portfolios over time would actually help answer your question if you look at a near term target fund you can see that a smaller percent is invested internationally the same way a smaller percent is invested in stocks   it 's because of risk   since it 's more likely that you will need some of the money soon and since you 'll be cashing out said money in us dollars it 's risky to have too much invested in foreign currencies   if you need money that 's currently invested in a foreign currency and that currency happens to be doing poorly against usd at the moment then you 'll lose money simply because you need it now this is the same rationale that goes into target date funds moving from stocks to bonds over time   since the value of a stock portfolio has a lot more natural volatility than the value of a bond portfolio if you 're heavily invested in stocks when you need to withdraw money there 's a higher probability that you 'll need to cash out just when stocks happen to be doing relatively poorly   being invested more in bonds around when you 'll need your money is less risky similarly being more invested in us dollars than in foreign currencies around when you 'll need your money is also less risky

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

past results are not a predictor of future results there is no explicit upper bound on a market and even if individual companies values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term plus there 's been some   shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth which will tend to increase the upward push trying to time the market to guess when it 's going to move in any particular direction is usually closer to gambling than investing the simplest answer remains a combination of buy and hold and dollar cost averaging buy at a constant number of dollars per month or whatever frequency you prefer and you will automatically buy more when the stock fund is lower less when it is higher that takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end personally i add a bit of contrarian buying to that i increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed since i had money i would n't need any time soon buy and hold and i was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that i was n't at significant risk of losing the investment that 's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an aggressive investor even though i 'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money my goal is to have the money work for me not vice versa

do you plan a monthly budget at the beginning of each month   this might seem counter intuitive but hear me out doing a budget is of course critically important for those who struggle with having enough money to last the month   having this written spending plan allows people struggling with finances to control their spending and funnel money into debt reduction or saving goals   however budgeting can also help those with the opposite problem there are some like you perhaps that have enough income and live frugally enough that they do n't have to budget   their money comes in and they spend so little that the bank account grows automatically   it sounds like a good problem to have but your finances are still out of control just in a different way   perhaps you are simply because you do n't know if you will have enough money to last or not by making a spending plan you set aside money each month for various categories in three broad areas since you have plenty of money coming in generously fund these spending categories   as long as you have money in the categories when you go to the store you can feel comfortable splurging a little because you know that your other categories are funded and the money is there to pay those other bills   create other categories such as technology or home improvement and when you need an app or have a home improvement project you can confidently spend this money as it has already been allocated for those purposes if you are new to budgeting software such as ynab can make it much easier

note this answer was provided when the question was only about life insurance therefore it does not address any other benefits term life insurance is very easy to evaluate once you have determined how much you need and for how long for significant amounts of coverage they may require a physical to be performed the price quotes will be for   two levels of health so you can compare costs from many companies quite easily   you have several sources in no particular order employer independent company 3rd party like aarp aaa or via you bank or credit union note that the 3rd party will be getting a cut of the premium also some choices offered from the employer or 3rd party may be limited in size or duration the independent companies will be able to have terms that extend for 10 years or more so view the insurance offered by aarp as just another option that has to be compared to all your other options

you will be best to cancel the original instruction first as you will have to wait for any pending payments to be received as the banks will not entertain multiple refunds after this can be confirmed the account will simply show a credit which you ask for   many lenders banks process these type of transactions after a period of time ie 30 days and there will be no way to speed this up so the sooner you act the better   when you contact the bank have bank details for the might transfer externally fingers crossed or you may receive a cheque in the post   try to avoid complicating the matter with changes of address and ringing before you have cancelled the instruction etc if possible

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

this is a good question and my answer below being the first rationale that crossed my mind is far from fleshed out it 's just a reply based on many books on the historical cycles of markets and it 's something i 've discussed at work i work in finance    historically we can observe that periods of financial booms high valuations of public equities tend to lead to lower returns it 's a fairly simplistic notion but if you 're paying more now for something when it 's potentially close to a high water mark then you 're returns in the short term are likely to be somewhat returns from the underlying companies have a hard time keeping up with high valuations such that investors are n't likely to see a return in the short run

i think the problem is that you 've made a math error this child would not be costing you 300 per month it will be costing you 1400 per month   1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash but you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable so if you are indeed splitting your expenses fifty fifty you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wife 's contribution   it would make the most sense i think to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses and if any is left over save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month when you need extra clothes or have to replace something they destroyed or want to pay for extra opportunities camps educational games lessons or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses higher education first car milestone celebrations safety net when starting out of course if your family is indeed a priority you might consider making an equal investment in your family say half your income 1800 to match half her time going into the building of the family   after all the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value not just a minimum bid for expenses   and again any extra can be spent on mutual expenses saved up for future costs or left as your child 's savings for major expenses or safety net i suppose i should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution 550 per month on the face of it as that should also balance out the monthly expenses   even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs   of course in this case you might want to take into account that while she 's working hours per week now running a household is i 've heard more closely equivalent to a week plus or minus being on call for a further 100 hours a week   trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked if you 're set on income ratios and splitting costs as they are also you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs unfair you mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a more stressful job well your job may well be more stressful than her job now but it is likely to be less so than raising a child her new job   as for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay again raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time money and anxiety than your education but her pay or even share of the costs does n't seem to be balanced in response   i 'm not gon na tell you what is fair that 's for you to work out just suggesting you really think it through before deciding what would be fair or not

first your professor should learn proper grammar should be why do   second it looks like you 're dealing with synthetic securities you can create a synthetic t bill by doing a combination of long short calls puts   but ignore all that just think about this without the technical jargon we know that the risk free rate is typically what t bills are yielding right and we know that since options are inherently more risky than us government debt investors will demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for the risk so as the risk free rate increases the value of a call will move the same direction otherwise investors would stop dealing with call options and would instead buy safer less risky riskless investments   it 's not really an options question just one of basic finance risk understanding of interest rates etc

if a company 's shares trade in multiple exchanges the prices in every exchange are very near to each other otherwise you could earn money by doing arbitrage deals buying in one selling in the other and people do that once it becomes worth it which stock exchange you use is more a convenience for the buyer seller many investment banks offer only something local near and you have to go to specific investment banks to use other exchanges for example in germany it is easy to deal in frankfurt but if you want to trade at the the nasdaq you have to run around and find a bank that offers it and you probably have to pay extra for it in the usa most investment banks offer nasdaq but if you want to trade in frankfurt you will have run around for an international company that offers that as a stock owner buyer you can sell buy your shares on any stock exchange where the company is listed again assuming your investment broker supports it so you can buy in frankfurt and sell in tokyo seconds later as nothing needs to be physically moved companies that are listed in multiple stock are typically large and offer this to make trading their shares easier for a larger part of the world considering your theoretical buy all shares the shares are not located in the exchanges they are in the hands of the owners and not all are for sale for various reasons the owners decide if and when they want them offered for sale and they also decide which stock exchange they offer them on so you would need to go to all exchanges to buy them all however if you raise your offer price in one exchange only slightly someone will see the arbitrage and buy them in the other locations and offer them to you in your stock exchange in other words for a small fee the shares will come to you but again most shares are typically not for sale it 's the same as trying to buy all chevy even if you had the money most owners would n't know or care about you you would have to go around and contact every single one and convince them to sell

you need to have 3 things if you are considering short term trading which i absolutely do not recommend the ability to completely disconnect your emotions from your gains and losses yes even your gains but especially your losses the winning losing on a daily basis will cause you to start taking unnecessary risk in order to win again if you ca n't disconnect your emotions then this is n't the game for you   the lowest possible trading costs to enter and exit a position people will talk about 1 trading costs that rule of thumb does n't apply anymore personally my trading costs are a total basis points to enter and exit a $ 10,000 position and i think it 's still too high that 's just a hair above one of 1 for you non traders   the ability to gut check and exit a losing position fast do n't hesitate and do n't hope for it to go up gtfo if you are serious about short term trading then you must close all positions on a daily basis   do n't do margin in today 's market as many valuations are high and some industries are not trending as they have in the past the leverage will kill you it 's not a question of if it 's a when   you 're new do n't trade anything larger than a $ 5,000 position no matter what do n't hold more than 10 of your portfolio in the same industry do n't be afraid to sit on 50 cash or more for months at a time use money market funds to park cash because they are t+1 settlement and most firms will let you trade the stock without cash as long as you effect the money market trade on the same day since stock settlement is t+3

you 'd need millions of dollars to trade the number of shares it would take to profit from these penny variations   what you bring up here is the way high frequency firms front run trades and profit on these pennies say you have a trade commission of $ 5   every time you buy you pay $ 5 every time you sell you pay $ 5   so you need a gain in excess of $ 10 a 10 gain on $ 100   now if you wanted to trade on a penny movement from $ 100 to $ 100.01 you need to have bought 1,000 shares totaling $ 100,000 for the $ 0.01 price movement to cover your commission costs   if you had $ 1,000,000 to put at risk that $ 0.01 price movement would net you $ 90 after commission $ 10,000,000 would have made you $ 990   you need much larger gains at the retail level because commissions will equate to a significant percentage of the money you 're investing very large trading entities have much different arrangements and costs with the exchanges   they might not pay a fee on each transaction but something that more closely resembles a subscription fee and costs something that more closely resembles a house now to your point catching these price movements and profiting   the way high frequency trading firms purportedly make money relates to having a very low latency network connection to a particular exchange   their very low latency very fast network connection lets them see orders and transact orders before other parties    say some stock has an ask at $ 101 x 1,000 shares   the next depth is $   you see a market buy order come in for 1,000 shares and place a buy order for 1,000 shares at $ 101 which hits the exchange first then immediately place a sell order at $ changing the ask from $ to $ and selling in to the market order for a gain of $ 0.09 per share

another thing to consider however is the deductibility of business expenses   let 's assume that the employer can legitimately hire you as a 1099 contractor   would you be able to would you have a high degree of control over when you worked and when you did n't   these factors also affect whether you 're a true independent 1099 contractor or not   as a legit 1099 contractor you 're able to deduct certain business expenses directly from your income you can find a list of the rules at irs.gov   as a w2 employee by contrast can deduct only business expenses that exceed 2 of the your agi adjusted gross income   so you also have to consider your personal circumstances in making the calculus and comparing whether a legitimate 1099 contractor job is or is not good for you   it 's not just a comparison of what they 'd pay w2 employees versus what they 'd pay 1099 contractors

there are very strict regulations that requires the assets which a fund buys on behalf of its investors to be kept completely separate from the fund 's own assets which it uses to pay its expenses except for the published fees funds are typically audited regularly to ensure this is the case so the only way in which a default of the fund could cause a loss of money would be if the fund managers broke the regulations and committed various crimes i 've never heard of this actually happening to a normal mutual fund there is of course also a default risk when a fund buys bonds or other non equity securities and this may sometimes be non obvious for example some etfs which are nominally based on a stock index do n't actually buy stocks instead they buy or sell options on those stocks which involves a counterparty risk the etf may or may not have rules that limit the exposure to any one counterparty

by process i assume you mean the financial process financially this does n't look any different to me than buying an empty lot to build a rental unit with the added expense potentially significant of doing the tear down given your lack of experience and capital i would be very hesitant to jump in like this you are going to have to spend a lot of time managing the build process or pay someone else to do it for you and expect everything to take twice as long and cost twice as much as you expect if you really want to get into the landlord business i would suggest starting with a structurally sound building that needs some renovation work and start there one you have that up and running you can use the cash flow and equity to finance something more aggressive if you still think you want to do this the first thing to do is figure out if the financials make sense how much will it cost to do the tear down and rebuild plus the typical rental expenses ongoing maintenance taxes insurance vacancy rates and compare that to the expected rental rates in the area to see how long it will take to 1 achieve a positive cash flow and 2 break even there are a lot of good questions on this site related to rentals that go into much more detail about how to approach this

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

it means a 3 return on the value of the stock if a stock has a $ 10 share price the dividend would be $ 0.30 normally though the dividends are announced as a fixed amount per share because the share price fluctuates if a percentage were announced then the final cost would not be known as the share priced could change radically before the dividend date

i worked in hr recruiting software for 6 applications web sites while this all sounds heavy handed our experience was that this was an individual problem not a corporate problem in other words if you can show the hiring manager they are being racist and educate them both on the their bias and on the tracking capabilities people changed their hiring bias or they were fired for cause yes big companies wanted the data to prove they were not being racist but even small companies benefited from having the data if a company wants to be racist in their hiring i am ok with that company going away

people can pretend that those are the only types that work those jobs but that is most often not the case most of the jobs in this economy are service jobs like 70 are so are we to then assume that 70 of people had better just be teenagers who need beer money obviously this is an oversimplification but i think the point is clear enough it is not as if people pop out a kid and subway suddenly says thanks for your service please report to a decent job with reasonable pay to start work monday those jobs just are n't there furthermore it is n't like subway or mcdonalds or walmart ca n't afford it or like their prices would go up significantly to shoulder it if walmart were to pay a living wage it would cost their customers an extra cent or two per item i imagine it would impact each business differently but paying employees decent wages often proves to be a more cost effective strategy because turnover and customer satisfaction go ask shake shack or or in n out its also better for the economy overall

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

not directly nintendo but a company would want its share price to be high if it wants to sell its stock e.g. on ipo or on subsequent offerings however if they want to buy back some shares it would be in their interest to get more stock for the buck there may of course be derivative values associated with a high share price e.g. if they bet on the price or have agreements with investors for particular to be reached employees might hold shares and be motivated by share price increases so a decrease may not be desired unless they are into some kind of insider trading buy low sell high and last over valued share prices may undermine trust in a company and failing to inform shareholders sufficiently may be outright illegal besides those reasons related to law funding sales public relations and company image companies should be pretty much independent from their own share prices in contrast to share distribution

the economic effect of a cfd from your point of view is very close to the effect of owning the stock if the stock goes up you make money if it goes down you lose money if it pays a dividend you get that dividend you 'll typically pay commission for buying and selling the cfds in a similar way to the commission on stock purchases though one of the advertised advantages of cfds is that the commission will be lower they also often have tax advantages for example in the uk you do n't have to pay stamp duty on cfds in theory you are exposed to credit risk on the cfd issuer which you are n't with the real stocks if the issuer goes bankrupt you may lose any money you have invested regardless of how well the stock has performed it 's certainly similar to a bet but not much more so than investing directly in the stock in practice the issuer of the cfds is likely to hedge its own exposure by actually buying the underlying stocks directly but they can aggregate across lots of contracts and they would tolerate some unhedged exposure to the stock so they can cut down on the transaction fees you also wo n't get the same voting rights as the underlying stock would grant you

nobody can give you a definitive answer   to those who suggest it 's expensive at these prices i 'd point to this showing the price of gold versus the global money supply over the past decade or so   it 's not conclusive but it 's evidence that gold tracks the money supply relatively well   there might be a bit of risk premium baked in that it would shed in a stable economy but that premium is unknowable   it 's also imo probably worth the protection it provides   in an inflationary scenario euro devaluation gold will hold its buying power very well   it also fares well in a deflationary environment just not quite as well as holding physical currency   note that in such an environment bank defaults are a big danger that 50k might only be safe under your mattress rather than in a fractionally reserved bank account   if you 're buying gold certificates are n't exactly a bad option although there still exists the counterparty risk of the agent storing your gold as well as political risk of the nation where it 's being held   buying physical bullion these risks but then you face the problem of protecting it   safe deposit boxes a home safe or burying it in your backyard are all possible options   the merits of each i 'll leave as an to the reader   foreign currency might be a little bit better than the euro but as we 've seen in the past year or so the swiss franc has been devalued to match the euro in the proverbial race to the bottom   it 's probably not much better than another fiat currency   i do n't know anything about norway   edit depending on your time horizon my personal opinion would be to put no less than 5 10 of your savings in a hard store of value e.g. gold silver platinum   depending on your risk appetite you could probably stand to put a lot more into it especially given the eurozone turmoil   of course as with anything else your mileage may vary past performance does not guarantee future results this is not investment advice seek professional medical help if you experience an lasting longer than four hours

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

considering the combined accounts you 're contributing $ 100 per month and they want $ 100 per year to administer them that 's of your contributions gone to fees each year   to me that 's a definite no   without getting in to bad the adviser for even making the suggestion the scale of your account does n't warrant a fee that high fees are very meaningful to the little fish investors   there are loads of ira account providers   with that level of competition there are several that have very reasonable account minimums no annual maintenance fees and a suite of no fee no load no commission low expense ratio funds to choose from   schwab fidelity and vanguard come to mind   i know schwab is running a big ad campaign right now as it 's reduced some of it 's already low expense ratios if i were you yes i would move the account because you can even get rid of the $ account fee   but no i would not move it to a higher fee situation in my opinion on a $ 3,600 account + $ 1,200 per year in contributions you do n't need advise   you need a good broad market low fee index fund and enough discipline to understand that retirement is 25 years away so you keep contributing even when news is bad and the market is going down   in 10 years maybe talk to an adviser using the s&p500 index daily close historical data from calendar year 2016 considering first of the month monthly deposits and a starting balance of $ 3,600 you would come out at the end of the year with about $   that 's $ in gain on your total contributions of $   they 'd take $ 100 that 's about 20 of your gain   compared to a no fee account with a reasonable expense ratio of 0.1 the fee would be just $   bearing in mind also that your $ 100 per year account will probably be invested in funds that also have an expense ratio fee structure further gains   further you lose the compounding effect of the $ 100 fee over time which adds up to a significant of retirement funds considering a 25 year period   if all you did was put that $ 100 fee in to a 1 savings account each year for 25 years you 'd end up with $ considering the average 7 return of the s&p you 'd have $ on just your $ 100 per year fees this is why you should be so vigilant about fees

you could do that once maybe if the lender negotiates rather than going to court and taking you for everything you have plus having you wages garnished for the next several decades and in the process you would destroy your credit rating making it impossible to borrow again any time soon doing this deliberately is fraud but worse than that it 's stupid you are likely to lose far more than you could gain

as suggested above i am not questioning the validity of the study by and di i do n't doubt that there is some discount to the risk premium demanded in the market for the debt of systemically important banks    what i am is that this is a subsidy by the us government this is a subsidy by bond investors not the us government additionally it is based on the assessment of risk by those investors as there is no explicit guarantee by the us government see lehman brothers and bear stearns there is no transfer of wealth by the us government and therefore there is no active subsidy

first off you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is safe meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations   your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough   that rules out things like stock market investments secondly you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money   if you have an emergency odds are you do n't want to be waiting around for weeks months years for the money to become available   this rules out most fixed term investments bonds traditional cds etc if you are concerned that you will need near instant access to your emergency money then you probably want to keep it in a savings or money market account at the same bank as your checking account   most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly unfortunately your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the savings mma far below the inflation rate   this means your money will slowly lose value over time   be prepared to keep contributing to it for most people being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days < 1 week is sufficient   worst case you charge something on your credit card and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives if money within a few days is okay for you there are a few options money market mutual funds not to be confused with a money market account this is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund   these are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account   an example of such a fund would be fidelity cash reserves   are not fdic insured so they are not exactly zero risk   however they are considered extremely safe   they almost never go down in value only a few times in the past few decades and when they have the fund manager or the federal govt stepped in to restore the value   they usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account and are available in taxable and non taxable varieties online high yield savings or money market account these are a relatively new invention   it 's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers but it 's online only   no local branch means low overhead so they offer higher interest rates 2.0 vs 0.5 for your local bank   some of them used to be over 5 before the economy tanked   like your local bank it is fdic insured one bit of caution   some of these accounts have become lately   they have started to do things like promo rates for a few months only offering the high interest rate on the first few $ k deposited limiting the amount that can be withdrawn etc   be sure to read the details before you open an account no penalty cds certificates of deposit usually offer a better rate than a savings account but your money is locked up until the cd term is up e.g. 36 months   if you need to cash out before then you pay a penalty   some banks have begun to offer cds that you can cash out with no penalty at all   these can offer better rates than the savings account   make sure it really is no penalty though   also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time   this can be an issue if you want to deposit $ 100 from every paycheck rewards checking accounts these are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate 3 or more provided you generate enough activity   most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month   if you can stay on top of the requirements these can be a great deal   if you do n't stay on top of it your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful though personally we use the online high yield savings account for our emergency fund   i 'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use   the best deal changes almost week to week   instead i will say to check out bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and cds that you can sort   the bank deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes

you 're exactly right and i agree with you completely   just to add another important fact is that autos simply do n't represent as large or sticky of an asset on peoples personal balance sheets a house often represents a significant leverage on income but cars are a fraction of the price significantly more liquid and purchased with the expectation of depreciation so there 's much less incentive to over leverage as opposed to buying a house and reselling when the market rises all of these aspects naturally limit the amount of damage that a broad auto loan default could have and limits the of the default of one loan to another   i think people just liked the movie too much and are searching for the next big

i see you 've marked an answer as accepted but i must tell you that stopping your 401k contribution all together is a bad idea your company match is 100 rate of 50 depending on structure   i do n't care what market you look at or how bad a loan you take out you will not receive 100 rate of return or be charged 100 interest further taking out a loan against your 401k effectively does two things it is a loan that must be repaid according to the terms of your 401k   and in every 401k i 've ever encountered you can not make contributions to the 401k until the loan is repaid this in effect stops your contributions and will almost certainly save you very little on your interest rates on your current loans i have 4 potential solutions that may help achieve your goal without sacrificing your 401k match and transferring the debt from one lender to another but they are conditional is your company match 100 up to 4 of your salary or 50 of your contribution up to a limit you have not yet reached this is important   if it is 100 up to 4 stop committing the additional 4 and use that to pay down your debt and after ward set up that 4 as auto pay into an ira not into the 401k   an ira will make you more money because you have control over its management not your employer if it is 50 match contribute until the match is met because you can not get 50 rate of return anywhere then take your additional monies and get an ira   as far as your debt in this scenario simply suck it up and pay it as is   you will lose far more than you gain by stopping your contributions if you simply must reduce your expenses by 150 $ month try refinancing the mortgage and rolling the 6500 $ into it   if you get a big enough drop in the interest rate you could still end up paying less or if you can not make the gain there try snowballing the three payments   you do this by calling your student loan vendor and telling them you need to make much smaller payments like even zero depending on the type of loan   then take all of the money you are currently spending on the 3 loans and put into the car payment   when it 's gone roll the whole thing into the higher interest student loan then finally roll it all into the last student loan   you 'll pay it off faster and student loans have lots of laws and regulations regarding working with payers to keep them paying something without breaking them whatever you do do not stop your contributions   50 or 100 that money is guaranteed at a higher rate of return than you can get anywhere especially guaranteed

let 's do a real example of leverage on the spy imagine you have $ 20 k today and plan on having $ 100 k by jan 2018   you could get 100 shares of spy and ride it out   maybe buying another 100 shares every few months until 2018 ending up with less than 500 shares to your name and zero cash in the bank or you could lever with dec 2017 leap calls they 'll expire in 2.5 years so you 'd have to re up sooner than your plan    with 20 k starting cash in my example we 'll go with 5 contracts to start with   if we choose the $ 230 strike they 'd cost $ 1250 each putting roughly $ at risk    the plan in is if the stock market goes up you 've got leverage   you are the proud owner of contracts worth 500 shares of spy and have only spent 1/3rd of your present day dollars   if the market goes down in the next two years sure you lost the entire $ but likely saved $ powder dry and can try your luck with the 2021 leaps    probably get down votes for this but i 'll even argue that proper use of leverage can very much reduce your risk    one truth is you 'll never get a margin call from holding long options

yes the de beers group of companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century they still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing particularly with the slogan a diamond is forever has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society the intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds the larger the diamond the more likely it is to have flaws so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 or greater you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones some other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design this is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation one common example is the cut sometimes referred to as the cut diamonds can also be manufactured the same carbon structure can be grown in a lab these stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities most manufactured diamonds are used but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for quality synthetic diamonds they sell at a decent discount so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute in the years to come you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers prices

in a fixed currency system large corporations can easily fund big new investments and it 's super cheap   that 's because they are using retained earnings and not competing with lots of fractionally reserved money that is squandering resources chasing whatever bubble is in vogue at the moment   if you know that a company called toyota with no access to any retained earnings should build a car for $ 1 billion dollars and it is guaranteed to be a success before you ever even got started well then you 've solved the central planning problem and can just do away with private industry and run the whole world by decree because you have perfect information about the future     that does n't mean that government should n't exist   in a gold backed system the government can tax the population and invest in infrastructure or whatever but when they do that the population will have less to spend consumption industries will contract and production will be to the government 's whim until the investing is over and then the people will all get their money back through wages or business profits from selling to the government   it 's important that the government have a stable and predictable spending program so they do n't cause undue damage to the capital structure

typically your statement will break down each of the balances that carry a different rate so you 'll see them lumped into the 0 line or two separates lines with different rates for each if you do n't see it on the statement a quick call to your bank should clarify it for you if i had to guess i would lean towards the fee likely being at 0 also but if it is n't typically you would pay the minimum + $ 350 on your next statement because only amounts over the minimum go towards principal of the highest rates first at least this is true in the us for personal accounts of course this is something your bank should be able to clarify as well balance transfer tip i always recommend setting up automatic payments when you take advantage of a balance transfer offer the reason is oftentimes buried deeply in the terms and conditions is an evil phrase which says that if you miss a payment they have the right to revoke the promotional rate and start charging you a higher rate that would be bad enough if it happened but to make things worse i believe the fee you paid for the transfer is not returned to you so set up an auto payment each month for at least the minimum payment and if you can afford it divide the total transferred by the number of months and pay that amount each month assuming you do n't pay interest on the fee $ 17,500 1.02 18 = $ month that way you 'll have it paid off just in time to not have any higher interest when the promotional rate expires if you do n't know if you can afford the higher amount each month set it to the max you know for sure you can afford and make additional payments whenever you can

inflation is basically this   over time prices go up i will now address the 3 points you have listed suppose over a period of 10 years prices have doubled   now suppose 10 years ago i earned $ 100 and bought a nice pair of shoes   now today because prices have doubled i would have to earn $ 200 in order to afford the same pair of shoes   thus if i want to compare my earnings this year to 10 years ago i will need to adjust for the price of goods going up   that is i could say that my $ 100 earnings 10 years ago is the same as having earned $ 200 today or alternatively i could say that my earnings of $ 200 today is equivalent to having earned $ 100 10 years ago this is a difficult question because a car is a depreciating asset which means the real value of the car will go down in value over time let us suppose that inflation does n't exist and the car you bought for $ 100 today will depreciate to $ 90 after 1 year a 10 depreciation but because inflation does exist and all prices will be 0.5 higher in 1 years time we can calculate the true selling price of the car 1 in year as follows 0.5 of $ 90 = 0.005 90 = $ 0.45 therefore the car will be $ 90 + $ 0.45 = $ in 1 years time if inflation is low then the repayments do not get much easier to pay back over time because wages have not risen by as much   similarly the value of your underlying asset will not increase in value by as much however as compensation the interest rates on loans are usually lower when inflation is lower therefore generally it is better to get a loan in times of high inflation rather than low inflation however it really depends on how the much the interest rates are relative to the inflation rate

your are mixing multiple questions with assertions which may or may not be true so i 'll take a stab at this comment if it does n't make sense to you to answer the question in the title you invest in an ira because you want to save money to allow you to retire the government provides you with tax incentives that make an ira an excellent vehicle to do this the rules regarding ira tax treatment provide disincentives through tax penalties for withdrawing money before retirement this topic is covered dozens of times so search around for more detail regarding your desire to invest in items with high intrinsic value i would argue that gold and silver are not good vehicles for doing this intrinsic value does n't mean what you want it to mean in this context gold and silver are commodities whose prices fluctuate dramatically   if you want to grow money for retirement over a long period of time you should be invested in diversified collection of investments and precious metals should be a relatively small part of your portfolio

at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit i think you are mixing things there is no concept of interest or compounding in mutual funds when you buy a mutual fund it either appreciates in value or depreciates in value both can happen depending on the time period you compare now let 's assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now $ 10,500 the way you need to look at this is given you started with $ 10,000 and its now $ 10,500 the return is 5 now if you want to calculate simple return or compounded return you would have to calculate accordingly you may potentially want to find a compounded return for ease of comparison with say a bank fd interest rate or some other reason   so if $ 10,000 become $ 10,500 after one year and $ 11,000 after 2 year the absolute return is 10 the simple yearly return is 5 or the simple rate of return for first year is 5 and for second year is 4.9 or the average year on year return is

hemp is already pretty easily grown by farmers here   canada had 50,000 acres of legal hemp in 2006 but it 's been in decline the last 3 years due to the cost lack of demand and the high values of some other crops   it 's also difficult to harvest due to its size it 's possible that the demand for hemp products will increase but given that many asian countries russia china and korea for example never banned it in the first place there 's a pretty ready supply already in place   in canada the big reason to grow it is as an alternative crop for use in rotation that has some commercial demand but it 's certainly not as valuable as crops like or soy beans

if you want to convert more than a few thousand dollars one somewhat complex method is to have two investment accounts at a discount broker that operations both in canada and the usa then buy securities for usd on a us exchange have your broker move them to the canadian account then sell them on a canadian exchange for cad   this will of course incur trading fees but they should be lower than most currency conversion fees if you convert more than a few thousand dollars because trading fees typically have a very small percentage component using a currency etf as the security to buy sell can eliminate the market risk in any case it may take up to a week for the trades and transfer to settle

contrary to popular belief you can build your credit if that is important to you without paying a penny in interest   this is done through the responsible use of credit cards paying the bill in full each month without accruing any interest charges if i were you i would pay off the loan today if possible   after that if you decide you need to build up your credit apply for a credit card   if you have difficulty with that you can get a small secured credit card or retail store credit card until you have enough history to get a regular credit card

well to start with i would make sure that the interest total you are collecting each month is greater than the interest total you are paying each month on your credit card debt   so if you have $ 200 a month in interest you pay the credit card company i would make sure that the interest you collect on the loan is more than $ 200 a month   and make sure that you use some portion of the principle payment to pay down the credit card debt so that you are still even or ahead of the interest you owe the credit card company beyond that i would want the rate to be higher than the borrower could expect from a bank   this will incentivize the borrower to either pay it off early or refinance the loan through a bank effectively paying it off early for you   anything that shifts the risk off of you and onto someone else is in your favor here you could also implement some sort of final payment fee and reduce this fee by a certain amount presumably up to 100 if it is paid off early   i would graduate that amount so there is still incentive if the buyer misses the original date but still incentive to meet the date   if the loan was for 10 years then i would probably do around .5 per year early    i would also get an attorney to draw up the loan paperwork to make sure that potentially your heirs are covered should you need to recover from a default bankruptcy or other potential problems   i would bet the lawyer fees will save you the amount if only in headaches   and if you are dealing with family the lawyer makes a great fall guy to say i wish i could do that but the lawyer wo n't let me if the family member tries to take advantage

the tax code is a of rules that are often tough to explain   the reality is that it 's our congress that writes the tax code and they often have conflicting goals among themselves   in theory someone said how about we force withdrawals at some point after all these are retirement accounts not give your kid a huge inheritance account and the discussion continued from there the age 70 1/2 was arbitrary 70 happens to be the age for maximum social security benefits but the average retirement age is 63 to make things more confusing one can easily start taking ira or 401(k withdrawals at age 59 1/2 but for 401(k as early as 55 if you separate from the job at 55 or later one can also take withdrawals earlier from an ira with tax but no penalty using sec rules such as on substantially equal periodic payments   to add to the confusion roth ira no rmds roth 401(k rmds once separated from service since the money has already been taxed it 's the tax on the growth the government loses my advice to the reader would be to move the roth 401(k to a roth ira before 70 1/2 my advice to congress would be to change the code to have the same rules for both accounts   whether one agrees that a certain rule is fair to them or others is up to them i think we can agree that the rules are remarkably complex from origin to execution and a moving target you can see just from the history of this site how older questions are often as code changes occur

you will be rolling over the proceeds since you can only deposit cash into an ira however this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre rollover sale is non taxable within the 401k and the period of roll over itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short so whatever investments you choose in your 401k you 'll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the ira if you 're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out that can definitely happen but it is not really something you can prepare for you can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal if you think it will make you feel safer otherwise i do n't think it really matters

yes you ca n't simply withdraw your super until you are aged 60 and that may go up slightly on budget night but you can roll it over into a smsf where you decide where you invest your super funds however i would advise against you starting a smsf at this early age with a very small super fund account the admin and audit fees would eat your super account up in one year it is recommended that you have at least $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 in super fund assets before starting a smsf to make the fees competitive and efficient now if you are with a partner and start a smsf together then it is your combined funds that need to be over the $ 300 k mark a smsf can have between 1 to 4 members the cheapest fund i could find was first state super the fees are $ 52 + per year for the high growth option so for a balance of $ 1000 you would pay $ or per year the high growth investment option has returned over the last year pa over the last 5 years and pa over the last 10 years which includes the period covering the gfc so even with a small balance of $ 1000 your super investment will still continue to grow if you could slowly grow your super account to $ 2000 your fees would be $ or and at $ 3000 balance your fees would be $ or the great thing about super is the tax advantages you may be complaining now about fees on a small balance and yes you should try to minimise these fees not only when you have a small balance but also when your balance is larger but the tax advantages available through superannuation will really come into play when you are on a high income paying the tax at or near the highest marginal tax rate compare the top marginal tax rate plus medicare levy at compared to the tax rate of 15 on super contributions and investment returns and it gets better when you retire and take a pension or lump sum from your super after age 60 you pay zero tax on the income stream or lump sum and you also pay zero tax on any ongoing investment returns in your super the benefits of superannuation are numerous and the best way to reduce your fees for now is to find a fund with lowest fees try to increase your balance so your percentage fees go down and try to consolidate all your super funds into the one with the lowest fees if you have more than one super fund

us checking accounts are not really secure though many people use them one form of check fraud has been highlighted by prof donald and carried out by frank as portrayed in the film catch me if you can basically anyone can write a check that would draw from your account merely by knowing your account number and your bank 's aba routing number   with those two pieces of information which are revealed on every check that you write anyone can print a working check either using a laser printer with micr magnetic ink character recognition toner or by placing an order with a check printing company   the only other missing element is a signature which is a pretty weak form of authentication when presented with such a check your bank would probably honor it before finding out too late that it is fraudulent a variant of this vulnerability is ach funds transfers   this is the mechanism through which you could have say your utility company automatically withdraw money from your account to pay your bill   unfortunately the transfer is initiated by the recipient and the system relies largely on trust with some statistical monitoring for suspicious patterns basically the whole us checking system is built with convenience rather than security in mind since other institutions are able to initiate withdrawal transactions by knowing just the aba number and account number   in practice it works well enough for most people but if you are paranoid about security as you seem to be you do n't want to be using checks the european system which has largely eliminated checks in favor of payer initiated push transactions is safer by design

this was a huge question for me when i graduated high school should i buy a new or a used car i opted for buying used i purchased three cars in the span of 5 years the first two were used first one was $ 1500 honda reliable for one year than problem after problem made it not worth it to keep second car was $ 2800 subaru had no problems for 18 months then problems started around 130k miles $ 1800 fix fixed it and it still burnt oil i stopped buying old after that finally i bought a nissan for $ 5500 30,000 miles private owner over 5 years i found that the difference between your typical car for $ 1500 and the typical car you can buy for $ 5500 is actually a pretty big difference   things to look for low mileage one owner recent repairs search google known issues for the make and model based on the mileage of the car your reviewing receipts clean interior buying from a private owner getting a deal where they throw in winter tires for free so you already have a set are all things to look for with that said buying new is expensive for more than just the ticket price of the car if you take a loan out you will also need to take out full insurance in order for the bank to loan you the car this adds a lot to the price of the car monthly depending on your views of insurance and how much you 're willing to risk buying your car outright should be a cheaper alternative over all than buying new save save save its very probably that the hassles of repair and surprise break downs will you enough to buy new or newer at some point but like the previous response said you worked hard to stay out of debt i 'd say save another grand buy a decent car for $ 3000 and continue your wise spending habits try to sell your cars for more than you bought them for look for good deals buy and sell work your way up to a newer more reliable car good luck

everyone that owns a share of stock in a company is part owner some just own more than others according to apple 's latest proxy statement he owns 5.5 million shares of the million shares outstanding so he owns approximately 0.6 of the company   if he owned more than 50 of the company 's outstanding stock he would effectively control the board of directors by being able to pick whoever he wanted   then he would control the company very few publicly traded companies are that way most have sold off parts of the company to the public in order to raise cash for the company and make their investment more liquid

certainly no one knows in advance how much a stock is going to swing around however there are measures of how much it has around in the past and there are people who will estimate the probability first of all there 's a measure of an individual stock 's volatility commonly referred to as beta a stock with a beta of 1 tends to rise and fall about as much as the market at large a stock with a beta of 2 in the meantime would rise 10 when the market is up 5 these are of course historical averages see wikipedia secondly you can get an implied measure of volatility expectations by looking at options pricing if a stock is particularly volatile the chance of a big price move will be baked into the price of the stock options note also that other things affect options pricing such as the time value of money for an options based measure of the volatility of the whole market see the volatility index aka the fear gauge vix   wikipedia chart looking at individual stocks as a group and there 's an oxymoron for you individual stocks are definitely much more likely to have big moves than the market besides netflix consider the bp oil spill or the tokyo electric power company 's incident i do n't have any detailed statistics on quantitatively how much mind you but in application a standard piece of advice says not to put more than 5 of your portfolio in a single company 's stock diversification protects you alternatively if you 're trying to play mr. sophisticated stock picker instead of just buying an index fund you can also buy insurance through stock options hedging your bets naturally this will eat up part of your returns if your pick was a good one

kind of matters because your definition of cost is solely based on a hindsight view of market movement   lack of gain is not cost except from an inflationary perspective versus actual value loss of entering near a top   on a long time scale yes the market will probably go up and value will return but telling someone that now is the perfect time to enter is entirely debatable momentum is not fundamental and could reverse tomorrow for all you know

here are the issues as i see them it 's not that i do n't trust banks but i just feel like throwing all    of our money into intangible investments is unwise banks have virtually nothing to do with this and intangible assets has a different meaning than you assume you do n't have to like the market but try to understand it and dislike it for a good reason which i wo n't offer here do your 401(k accounts offer company match when people start with we 'd like to reduce our deposits that 's the first thing we need to know last you plan to gain a few hundred dollars a month i bet it 's closer to zero or a loss i 'll return to edit we have recent posts here that reviewed the expenses to consider and i 'd bet that if you review the numbers you 've ignored some of them a few hundred say it 's $ 300 or $ it would take far less work and risk to simply save $ 100 k in your retirement accounts to produce this sum each year   the investment may very well be excellent i 'm just offering the flip side things you might have missed    edit please read the discussion at how much more than my mortgage should i charge for rent the answers offer a good look at the list of expenses you need to consider in my opinion this is one of the most important things i 've seen too many new re investors forget about so many expenses a projected monthly income reverts to annual losses

# 289906
not to state the obvious but you realize this can only be done in hindsight sure you can project out to get a range of expected return but the tax laws can change every year your own income changes so your marginal rate will change you may have started with a 7 mortgage and refinanced now to 4.5 so you are far better off than the original plan i 'll repeat what others mentioned for your own home the rent you are not paying is most of your return a $ 100 k home may appreciate at whatever rate 3 5 say but the $ 800/mo rent you do n't have to pay is $ nearly 10 so when you imply that a house merely rising with inflation is a zero real return i 'd suggest that 's far from accurate all other expenses taken into account of course

no it is not true it depends on the market the banks inventory the original debt that was owed etc etc the banks generally want to recover their money so in case of underwater properties they may end up hold a property for years until prices bounce back as it happened during the last crisis when many houses were for months years until banks put them back on the market hoping to sell at a price that would allow them to recover their losses

cfds contracts for difference are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position you are not actually buying the underlying with share cfds the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin you pay interest for every day you hold the cfds overnight for long cfds however with short positions you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight most people use cfds for short term trading however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin what you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount a way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses with your position sizing if you wanted to invest $ 10,000 in a particular share trading at $ 10 per share you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 cfds in that share your initial expense with the cfds might be only $ 1000 at a margin rate of 10 so instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of $ 10,000 with the cfds you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly

the market capitalization of a stock is the number of shares outstanding of each stock class times the price of last trade of each stock class in a liquid market where there are lots of buyers and sellers at all price points this represents the price that is between what people are bidding for the stock and what people are asking for the stock   if you offer any small amount more than the last price there will be a seller and if you ask any small amount less than the last price there will be a buyer at least for a small amount of stock thus in a liquid market everyone who owns the stock does n't want to sell at least some of their stock for a bit less than the last trade price and everyone who does n't have the stock does n't want to buy some of the stock for a bit more than the last trade price with those assumptions and a low friction trading environment we can say that the last trade value is a good midpoint of what people think one share is worth   if we then multiply it by the number of shares we get an approximation of what the company is worth in no way shape or form does it not mean that there is 32 billion more invested in the company or even used to purchase stock there are situations where a 32 billion market cap swing could mean 32 billion more money was invested in the company the company issues a pile of new shares and takes in the resulting money   people are completely neutral about this gathering in of cash in exchange for shares   so the share price remains unchanged the company gains 32 billion dollars and there are now more shares outstanding now in some sense there is zero dollars currently invested in a stock when you buy a stock you no longer have the money and the money goes to the person who no longer has the stock the issue here is the use of the continuous of invested in the investment was made at some point but the money does n't really stay in this continuous state of being   unless you consider the investment liquid and the option to take money out being implicit it being a continuous action does n't make much sense sometimes the money is invested in the company when the company causes stocks to come into being and sells them the owners of stocks has invested money in stocks in that they spent that money to buy the stocks but the total sum of money ever spent on stocks for a given company is not really a useful value the market capitalization is an approximation which under the efficient market hypothesis that markets find the correct price for things nearly instantly is reasonably accurate of the value the company has collectively to its shareholders   the efficient market hypothesis is n't accurate but it is an acceptable rule of thumb now this value market capitalization is arguably not the total value of a company other stakeholders include bond holders labour management various contract counter parties government and customers   some companies are structured so that almost all value is captured not by the stock owners but by contract counter parties this is sometimes used for hiding assets or debts but for most large publically traded companies it in theory should n't be far off

i do n't use a rule of thumb for this instead i use a budget   throwing money into a savings account for the purpose of building a savings account is okay but i only put money into a savings account that i have a purpose for   for example there are bills that come up once a year such as insurance premiums property tax annual subscriptions and memberships etc i plan for these in my budget each month and the money goes into my savings   i also have an emergency fund which is used in the event that a large one time unexpected expense comes up that i had n't planned for i have a goal for how large i want this fund to be so i put money in savings until it is built up to the level i want it at   there are other long range saving goals i have my next car vacation furniture replacement technology replacement etc each of these gets some money each month which goes into savings   i also have retirement savings in the budget but that does n't go into the savings account it gets invested in my retirement account   my point is that instead of arbitrarily choosing a percentage of your income to put into a savings account think about the purpose of that money that will help you determine how much needs to be saved and it will also help motivate you to do so

if the stock is below its purchase price there is no way to exit the position immediately without taking losses since presumably you had good reasons for buying that stock that have n't changed overnight what you should probably do is just hold it and wait for the stock to come back up otherwise you 're putting yourself into an ongoing pattern of buy high sell low which is precisely what you do n't want to do if you actually agree with the market that you made a mistake and believe that the stock will not recover any part of the loss quickly and indeed will continue going down you could sell immediately and take your losses rather than waiting and possibly taking more losses of course if the stock does recover you 've made the wrong bet there are conditions under which the pros will use futures to buffer a swing but that 's essentially a side bet and what it saves you has to be balanced against what it costs you and how certain you are that you now can predict the stock 's motion this whole thing is one of many reasons individuals are encouraged to work with index funds and to buy and hold rather than playing with individual stocks it is essentially impossible to reliably time the market so all you can do is research a stock to death before making a bet on it much easier and safer to have your money riding on the market as a whole so the behavior of any one stock does n't throw you into a panic if you ca n't deal with the fact that stocks go down as well as up you probably should n't be in the market

there is not one right way it depends on the level of detail that you need one way would be create the following accounts when you pay the phone bill when you are paid with the reimbursement that is when you pay the phone bill you must debit both phone expense to record the expense and also reimbursements due to record the fact that someone now owes you money if it 's useful you could add another layer of complexity when you receive the bill you have a liability and when you pay it you discharge that liability whether that 's worth keeping track of depends i never do for month to month bills afterthought i see another poster says that your method is incorrect because a reimbursement is not salary technically true though that problem could be fixed by the account to something like income from employer the more serious problem i see is that you are reversing the phone expense when you are reimbursed so at the end of the year you will show total phone expense as $ 0 this is clearly not correct you did have phone expenses they were just reimbursed you really are treating the expense account as an asset account phone expenses due to be reimbursed by employer

having just gone through selling a car i can tell you that carmax will most likely not be the best solution i recently sold my 09 vibe which had a kbb and edmonds value private party sale of around $ 6k trade in value was around $ i took it to the local carmax for a quote and they came back with $ 3,500   refinancing is tricky banks have a set limit on how old a car they will finance many wo n't even offer financing if the vehicle has over 100k miles we looked at refinancing our other car and even getting the apr down over a point we would only have saved $ or so banks typically offer much higher interest rates for used non dealership cars and refinancing than they do for new cars or even used cars purchased from a dealership assuming you have 2 3 years left on your loan i do n't think that refinancing would save you enough to be worth considering carmax sells cars in 1 of 2 ways they are also up front with you about the process they do not reference kbb or edmonds or any other valuation tool other than their own internal system they either take the car it up a bit then resell it on their lot or they sell it at auction if they determine your car will be sold at auction then they will offer you a rock bottom price the determining factors that come into play include age of the car mileage and of course overall condition if you mini is still in good shape and does n't have a lot of miles then they may try to resell it on their lot for which they could offer you closer to personal sale price than trade in how many 2007 's are for sale in your area how much are they selling for i did sell them a truck back in 2005 and received $ 200 more than kbb valued it for but it was in great shape only a couple of years old relatively low mileage and it was in high demand god bless the south and their love for trucks i ended up selling my to another local car dealership they offered me $ after negotiating leaving the dealership then negotiating more over the phone it took me a day and a half and really very little effort i have several friends that have gone through the same thing with selling cars and all have had similar luck going to other dealerships where prices can be negotiated rather than carmax   carmax has no incentive to settle or forgive your loan if you really want to pay it off save up what you believe the difference will be then shop your car around the local dealerships and get prices for your mini remember that dealers have to turn a profit so be reasonable with your negotiation if you can find comparable vehicles in your area listed for $ then knock $ 1,500 off that price and tell the dealerships that 's what you want

transactions cost is what kills you here the price of determining who gets what and then enforcing it    for example let 's say you invested in my electrical engineering class then when i get out of school i go to work at starbucks where i 'm applying literally none of that knowledge or experience and thus i signed a bad deal   or what if i change majors you still have a stake on my lifetime income but it wo n't be in the field you helped me into so college aged indecision would mean twice as much out of my take home income for life   or what if i 'd like to buy your percentage back from you what would be a fair price would there be a market to establish it   you should read the unincorporated man which has a system very similar to what you 're proposing    in this story education and subsistence investment have become expensive so in order to send a kid through college you 're actually purchasing shares of an individual 's future earnings like they 're a corporation parents get 10 when you 're born government gets 5 in lieu of taxes these shares have a market value based on income expenditures health etc pricing individuals just like you 'd price a company   in the story most individuals have sold over 50 of their shares meaning that they effectively do n't have controlling interest over their lives their jobs their homes all their major decisions are made by the shareholders so you might take a high risk job just because one of your biggest shareholders wants a payday   of course since it 's on the open market you can buy your shares back once you 're back over 50 you 're back in control of your life and the majority of your income the way the author it it 's a pretty comprehensive system and the book stays ambiguous as to whether it 's debt slavery or a new evolution of liberty   but again transactions costs think of six billion little corporations with all their vital stats and market data now imagine voting on the jobs and homes of the potentially hundreds of people in whom you have an interest it would simply be impossible to keep track of   honestly it 'd probably be more modest to just pay your student loans

derivatives derive their value from underlying assets   this is expressed by the obligation of at least one counterparty to trade with the other counterparty in the future   these can take on as many combinations as one can dream up as it is a matter of contract for futures where two parties are obligated to trade at a specific price at a specific date in the future one buyer one seller if you short a future you have entered into a contract to sell the underlying at the time specified   if the price of the future moves against you goes up you will have to sell at a loss   the bigger the move the greater the loss   you go ahead and pay this as well as a little extra to be sure that you satisfy what you owe due to the future   this satisfaction is called margin if there were n't margin people could take huge losses on their derivative bets not pay and disrupt the markets   making sure that the money that will trade is already there makes the markets run smoothly it 's the same for shorting stocks where you borrow the stock sell it and wait   you have to leave the money with the broker as well as deposit a little extra to be sure you can make good if the market moves to a large degree against you

they used to pay over 90 during the glorious 30s 1940 1970 all of this is about the capture of politicians by the rich both democrats and republicans and the balance of power between labor and capital which has tilted on favor of capital as warren buffet said there is a class war and we are winning it with the free movement if capital it 's super easy for the super rich to get their money out of a country   now regarding of taxes and their level if you posit that taxes take away your hard earned work then both 10 and 90 are unacceptable it 's like a thief arguing he only stole 10 of a bank how is it more or less acceptable    of course i do n't subscribe to this logic at all i just want to point out that either any level of taxation is fair regardless of the level or unfair there are n't any in    to finish i would use market mechanisms to set taxation taxes on the super rich should be gradually increased until there is a noticeable effect on productive investment

to address the issue in the title of your question many expenses strike at what for all practical purposes are random intervals roof starts leaking car needs repair etc do n't have a fixed cost every month medical expenses can certainly be more extreme than many other expenses but their nature is the same and so the way to budget for them is the same you figure out what your average expenses are over a long period of time then you start putting away a little more than this amount every month keep putting away until you have a reserve larger than any expense you are likely to get hit with all at once   i have no idea what your particular expenses are so let me use myself for an example my medical bills last year were unusually large about $ 6,000 i have lousy insurance and a couple of chronic conditions so my bills are usually maybe $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per year so i plan on about $ 150 per month for medical bills most insurance policies have an out of pocket maximum this should be the most you 'd ever have to lay out in a year mine is $ 13,000 i told   you my insurance sucks so i have an account that i have now built up to $ 13,000 worst case i wipe out that account in any case if my bills are that large the doctors or hospital will normally agree to a payment plan i still owe a few hundred on my bills from last year and the hospital is letting me pay it off at $ 120 per month your question brings up a lot of issues about difficulties of working with insurance and the u.s. medical system in general i 'm not sure if your intent was to get advice on the rest of it all simple not pleasant but simple answer if you 're insurance is provided by your employer you 're pretty much stuck with the policy that the employer negotiates i do n't know how much you 're contributing to premiums usually the company pays the bulk of it you could investigate getting a policy on your own but odds are that any policy you could get for what you 're contributing now would be way worse than what you can get through the company you could always investigate but i doubt you 'll do better you can talk to hr if it 's a big company they may have some muscle with the insurance company and could help you out failing that it becomes a political question of how the laws affecting medical care and insurance in the u.s. are set up and while i have many ideas for how it could be improved sadly i 'm not in a position to do much about it and i doubt you are either unless you have the resources to run for president

when you buy a stock the worst case scenario is that it drops to 0   therefore the most you can lose when buying a stock is 100 of your investment when you short a stock however there 's no limit on how high the stock can go   if you short a stock at 10 and it goes up to 30 then you 've lost 200 on your investment   therefore shorting stocks is riskier than buying stocks since you can lose more than 100 of your investment when shorting because the price might go up but it will never be as big of a change as a regular price drop i suppose that is not true   stocks can sometimes go up significantly 50 100 or more in a very short amount of time on a positive news release such as an earnings or a buyout announcement   a famous example occurred in 2008 when volkswagen stock went up 400 in less than 2 days on some corporate news porsche for some reason wants to control volkswagen and by building up its stake has driven up the price hedge funds figuring the share price would fall as soon as porsche got control and stopped buying sold a lot of vw shares short then last weekend porsche disclosed that it owned percent of the stock and had acquired options for another percent it said it wanted to go to 75 percent the result instant short squeeze the german state of lower owns a 20 percent stake in vw which it said it would not sell that left precious few shares available for anyone else the shorts to cover and the price from about € 200 or about $ to above € 1,000

well these can range from loan broker to outright scams it is pretty typical that loan broker just take some fee in the middle for their service of filling your applications for a bunch of real loan provider companies because making a web page costs nothing a single loan broker could easily have many web pages with a bit different marketing so that they can get as many customers as possible but of course some of the web pages can be actual scams as soon as you provide enough information for taking out a loan they can go to a real financial institution take out the loan and run with the money in most countries consumer protection laws do not apply to business to business transactions so you have to be even more wary of scams than usual

no if you are taking a loss solely and purely to reduce the tax you have to pay then it is not a good strategy in fact it is a very bad strategy no matter what country you are in no investment choice should be made solely due to your tax if you are paying tax that means you made a profit if you made a loss just to save some tax then you are loosing money the whole point of investing is to make money not lose it

you have some of the math right but are missing a few things here 's what i can offer if i leave anything out someone please expand or clarify rental income can be reduced by mortgage interest and maintenance costs as you mentioned but also by property tax payments association fees insurance costs landlord expenses and depreciation note that if you do n't live in the property for 3 years you 'll have to pay capital gains tax if when you sell the house you can live in it again for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid this many people recommend only assuming you will get 10 months of rental income a year to account for transitions between tenants difficult in finding new tenants and the occasional deadbeat tenant this also adds a buffer for unexpected problems you need to fix in the house if you ca n't at least break even on 10 months of income a year consider the risk i think there are also some cases where you need to repay depreciation amounts that you have deducted but i do n't know the details renting out a house can be fun and profitable but it 's very far from a sure thing i 'd always recommend preparation and caution and of course talking to professionals about the finances accounting and lease writing good luck

you do n't have to retire but the us government and other national governments have programs that allow you to set aside money when you are young to be used when you are older   to encourage you to do this they reduce your taxes either now or when your are older they also allow your employer to match your funds in the us they have iras 401ks and social security   you are not required to stop working while tapping into these funds having a job and using these funds will impact your taxes but your are not forbidden from doing both decades ago most retirement funds come from pensions and social security most people are going to reach their senior years without a pension or with only a very small pension because they had one in one of their early jobs so go ahead gamble that you will not need to save for retirement then hope that decades later you were right about it because you ca n't go back in time and fix your choice   some never save for retirement either because they ca n't or they think they ca n't many that do n't save end up working longer than they imagined some work everyday until they die or are physically unable to work sometimes it is because they love the job but often it is because they can not afford to quit

my question is how income tax is calculated for partial redemption same as normal the redemption should always be treated as fifo say you are buying 10 units every month i know the units maybe in fraction and price would be different every month and you are investing fixed amount after say 9 months you have 90 units now when you sell say 45 units you are actually selling 10 units from first 4 months and 5 units from 5th month so calculate the price at which you purchased these units this becomes your cost now when you sell you know the price so subtract the sell price from cost price this is your taxable income short term capital gains is taxed as per your tax bracket so add this taxable income to your other income and calculate taxes accordingly you have to pay tax in advance and not wait till year end you can do this online as well

the solution is x = this assumes that chuck 's six years of deposits start from today so that the first deposit accumulates 10 years of gain i.e. +   the second deposit gains nine years interest + and so on     if you want to do this calculation using the formula for an annuity due i.e.   where   formula by induction you have to bear in mind this is for the whole time span k = 1 to n so for just the first six years you need to calculate for all ten years then subtract another annuity calculation for the last four years   so the full calculation is   as you can see it 's not very neat because the standard formula is for a whole time span   you could make it a little by using a formula for k = m to n instead i.e.   so the calculation becomes   which can be done with simple arithmetic and does n't actually need a solver

the answer is that it depends on your bank and your creditor whomever you are paying most banks offer overdraft protection for a fee they will process the payment as if you had the money and your account will become overdrawn the next deposit you put in will be applied to the overdraft and once the account is zeroed funds will begin to become available the fees charged and whether a particular charge will go through depend on the bank a few banks will process a payment without a fee if it only happens occasionally some will hit you with a charge per debit in excess of the amount while others will charge you per day on which debit transactions were made while your account was overdrawn and still others will tack on a charge for leaving your account overdrawn for an extended period in almost all cases the for profit institutions banks will charge more than non profit institutions credit unions   watch out for banks that offer automatic overdraft transfer they 'll automatically transfer from another account including eek a credit card to cover a debit to an account with insufficient funds sounds great but the fee they charge is often close to the overdraft fee while without overdraft protection if the payment were simply denied at point of sale most banks have smartphone apps that allow for instantaneous transfer of funds for free i 've never heard of a partial payment you either have sufficient funds to cover the debit or you do n't if you do n't and you do n't have overdraft protection the bank will simply decline to pay the result of that situation depends on the exact circumstances if a utility check bounces they may try to run it again the next day or they may immediately cut your utilities and come after you for the balance at point of sale they simply wo n't give you the merchandise some places are really about pursuing hot check writers if the check does n't clear you have to pay in cash on the spot or they call the police as far as interest on debt it does n't work that way it 's a service fee otherwise it would be subject to some pretty hefty federal regulation however if you figure it as interest you 'd be amazed let 's say you bought lunch at a burger joint for $ 10 you did n't have enough in the account but it was close so the bank let it go and charged you $ 35 you have effectively inflated the cost of that meal to $ 45 a 350 instantaneous price increase or if you prefer 350 interest on that $ 10 i dunno about you but if i were paying $ 45 for one lunch it would n't be at a burger joint most banks simply will not process a check on an already overdrawn account overdraft service or otherwise they 'll hit you for the overdraft fee usually actually a fee for an nsf check and decline the payment so if you had $ 1 in your account and wrote a rent check for $ 1000 it 'd still bounce even with overdraft service

tough spot i 'm guessing the credit cards are a personal line of credit in their name and not the company 's the fact that the business can be liquidated separately from your parents means they did at least set up an llc or similar business entity using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved at little cost to their personal credit and finances was indeed a very bad move the best possible end to this scenario for you and your parents would be if your parents could get the debt transferred to the llc before dissolving it at this point with the company in such a long standing negative situation i would doubt that any creditor would give the business a loan which was probably why your parents threw their own good money after bad with personal ccs they might in the right circumstances be able to convince a judge to effectively transfer the debt to the corporate entity before liquidating it that puts the debt where it should have been in the first place and the cc companies will have to get in line that means in turn that the card issuers will fight any such motion or decision tooth and nail as long as there 's any other option that gives them more hope of recovering their money your parents only for this to happen is if the ccs were used for the sole purpose of business expenses if they were living off the ccs as well as using them to pay business debts a judge best case would only relieve the debts directly related to keeping the business afloat and they 'd be on the hook for what they had been living on bankruptcy is definitely an option they will re affirm their commitment to paying the mortgage and any other debts they can and under a chapter 13 the judge will then negotiations over what total portion of each card 's balance is paid over what time and at what rate to a mediator chapter 13 bankruptcy is the less damaging form to your parent 's credit they are at least attempting to make good on the debt   a chapter 7 would wipe it away completely but your parents would have to prove that they can not pay the debt by any means and have no hope of ever paying the debt by any means if they have any retirement savings anything in their name for grandchildren 's college funds etc the judge and cc issuers will point to it like a bird dog apart from that their house is safe due to florida 's homestead laws but furniture appliances clothing jewelry cars and other vehicles pretty much anything of value that your parents can not defend as being necessary for life health or the performance of whatever jobs they end up taking to dig themselves out of this are all subject to seizure and auction they may end up just selling the house anyway because it 's too big for what they have left or will ever have again i do not under any circumstance recommend you putting your own finances at risk in this you may gift money to help or provide them a place to live while they get back on their feet but do not give till it hurts for this it sounds heartless but if you remove your safety net to save your parents then what happens if you need it your parents are n't going to be able to bail you out and as a contractor if you 're effectively doing business as contracting you do n't have the debt shield your parents had it looks like housing 's again due to the news that the fed 's going to start backing off you could need that money to weather a double dip in the housing sector over the next few months and you may need it soon

people worked a long time before business existed but i believe what works best for the greatest number of people is regulated capitalism mixed with a limited socialism and a strong social safety net aka social democracy but i believe that when a few people gain too much power control too many of a country 's resources that they distort or destroy it they make almost everyone 's life worse just to make their own better historically i see that again and again    past a certain point money ceases to be money and becomes power people with great wealth have power over the american people power they hold without being elected by the people power that does not end with their term of office power that can not be stripped from them for bad behavior no one should be allowed to have that much unelected power we should use progressive income taxes and estate taxes to strip power a.k.a money from such individuals and families this should be done to keep the from using unelected power for greedy or evil purposes

that 2 t is if you invest the money for a decade before cutting checks which is the methodology with which i mentioned i disagree   from the article   gt after spending a little quality time in microsoft excel i ’d say it ’s somewhere the ballpark of $ 1,350 per household or $ 1,000 per worker   if you divide $ 1000 per worker by ten years you get $ 100 per year which is what i said and which the title   edit i see what you mean i typed households instead of workers thanks for pointing out my typo i edited the comment to correct and show i originally also i put instead of 2 t either way the point is it is $ 100 per year not $ 1000 i should ’ve paid attention when commenting but the point remains valid

for your first question the general guidelines i 've seen recommended are as follows as to your second question portfolio management is something you should familiarize yourself with   if you trust it to other people do n't be surprised when they make mistakes   remember they get paid regardless of whether you make money   consider how much any degree of risk will affect you   when starting out your contributions make up most of the growth of your accounts now is the time when you can most afford to take higher risk for higher payouts still limiting your risk as much as possible of course   a 10 loss on a portfolio of $ 50k can be replaced with a good year 's contributions   once your portfolio has grown to a much larger sum it will be time to dial back the risk and focus on preserving your capital    when choosing investments always treat your as a whole including non retirement assets other investment accounts savings even your house   do n't put too many eggs from every account into the same basket or you 'll find that 30 of your is a single investment   also consider that some investments have different tax consequences and you can leverage the properties of each account to offset that

short answer is to put the max 15 contribution into your espp long answer is that since you want to be saving as much as you can anyway this is a great way to force you to do it and pick up at least a 15 return every six months or however often your plan makes a purchase i say at least because sometimes an espp will give you the lower of the beginning or end period stock price and then a 15 discount off of that but check the details of your plan if you feel like your company 's stock is a good long term investment then hold onto the shares when purchased otherwise sell as soon as you get them and bank that 15 return

you seem to really have your financial act together   your combination of assets and ongoing savings makes you the ideal candidate for paying it off one way to look at it is that your mortgage offers you a place to invest at a fixed 2 rate i 'd really like to not have a house payment is all i need to hear   the flip side is the lecture that talks about long term market returns the fact that the combination of your deductible mortgage but 15 cap gain rate means you need 2.5 return to break even and odds are pretty high that will occur over the next 15 years pretty high does not equal guaranteed and i wo n't debate the value of sleeping soundly vs an excess 5 8 return on this money that you 'd maybe achieve   you have n't missed anything in fact though i advocate saving first you are already doing that this is above and beyond good work

the can and the should have been discussed in other answers and comments   and so i will discuss the how   as others have noted it is important to make sure that the additional money goes to reducing principal and not towards   prepayment of interest   unfortunately very few bank tellers understand how mortgages work and very few bank officers even loan officers understand how mortgages work too thus a statement that you want the extra money to go towards principal will likely be met with a blank look furthermore what they do with the money and how it is entered on the bank books that afternoon when the transactions are recorded may have no to what was discussed and agreed to earlier in the day   based on my personal experiences and   many arguments with banks about how they handled my prepayments and how interest was computed i would   recommend the following which is easier now that automated payments are possible for the standard monthly payment and additional payments are possible via electronic funds transfer make sure that automated payments are made on the day that the payment is due not at the end of the ten day grace period that banks love to grant you for making the monthly payment yes there is no penalty for late payment as long as you pay before the end of the grace period but interest continues to be charged and so more of each delayed payment goes to interest   and less towards principal make the additional payment on the same day as the standard monthly mortgage payment is made this ensures that at worst just one day 's interest is owing when the additional payment is made also payment in the middle of the monthly cycle is an almost sure way of getting ripped off on the interest because the bank 's computers will post the payment in the manner most favorable to them and usually contrary to the terms of your mortgage   i have   complained to banks about mid month payments and won every time and on many occasions the bank officer would say we have always done it this way and nobody   ever complained till you did today i doubt very much if the bank 's programs got changed as a result of my complaints if you are not sure how mortgages work and how interest   is calculated or do n't have the time or inclination to go hassle with the bank each time but do prefer not to get ripped off make the payment as described on the dot and at the same time as the regularly scheduled monthly payment the amortization schedule that the bank should have given you shows how much the principal amount is after the monthly   payment is made on each due date   assuming that you have   not been taking advantage of the grace periods and so the schedule is correct make an additional payment not of a round sum but an exact amount down to the last penny that will jump you from principal owing after today 's regular payment to principal owing after the regular payment n months from today here of course you choose n based on how much extra money you were planning on paying towards your mortgage   by making the extra payment you will effectively have cut the length of   the mortgage by n months and the same amortization schedule will apply over the shorter period   since very little of the principal is repaid in the early life of the mortgage an additional principal only payment can reduce the length of the mortgage by years paying a specific amount that matches the amortization schedule also helps if you ever need to hassle with the bank it is their print out you are arguing from and not trying to explain to a clueless bank officer how the bank did not compute interest   correctly after you paid $ extra at beginning of last month

the answer is yes according to multiple online sources and my local bank this approach is a common technique to building your own home you finance the land build the simplest possible dwelling say a garage with 1 bathroom bedroom refi into a mortgage and get cash back and then build your real house or add on etc this eliminates the banks demands that come with a construction loan and saves you 10s of thousands in the process fees contractors scheduling design etc

at twenty two you can have anywhere between of your securities portfolio in equities it is reasonable to start at 100 and reduce over time   the one thing that i would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70 bonds   you should never have more than 30 bonds   why   because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100 bonds and will give a higher return   absent some market timing strategy which as an amateur investor you should absolutely avoid or some complicated balancing scheme there is never a reason to be at more than 30 bonds    a 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100 bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix it is actually riskier   why   because sometimes bonds fall   and when they do stocks generally gain   and vice versa   because of this behavior the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50 or 100 bonds    does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70   no   if your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70   the problem is that when you drop stocks below 70 you should drop bonds below 30 as well   so you keep the stock to bond ratio at    if you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix then you should move into cash equivalents   cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination   but at twenty two you do n't really need more safety    at twenty two the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund   this should be able to handle six months of expenses without income   i recommend making it equal to six months of your income   the reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses   also you can save six months of income at twenty two    are you going to stay where you are for the next five years   at twenty two the answer is almost certainly no   but the standard is the five year time frame   if you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work then no   if you stay somewhere at least five years then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses   less than five years the reverse is true   so you should probably rent now    you can max out your 401k and ira now   doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty seven   and perhaps more importantly it helps keep your spending down   the less you do spend the less you will feel that you need to spend    once you fill your emergency fund start building savings for a house   i would consider putting them in a real estate investment trust reit   a reit will tend to track real estate   since you want to buy real estate with the results this is its own kind of safety   it fell in value   houses are probably cheap   houses increasing in price rapidly   a reit is probably growing by leaps and bounds   you do this outside your retirement accounts as you want to be able to access it without penalty

i think you 're a little confused about taxes first i 'm guessing that you feel your lack of home ownership makes your taxes higher   that might be true or it might not   the main tax break you would get from home ownership is the mortgage interest deduction and that is a fraction of what you 're paying in interest   so yeah your tax bill is lower but 3 4 times that amount is going out the door in interest   plus when you buy a property you may have substantial taxes on that property that your landlord is paying now secondly yes you can deduct expenses on a business but that only can be done without income for so long before the irs begins your deductions   but if you 're making money the expenses come right off of your income third owning a business means that you get the privilege of paying a self employment tax which is the same thing that your employer now pays into social security on your behalf   more taxes so in short owning and operating a business has the potential to be more rewarding than holding down a job and i recommend starting up a side business just to get another income stream going but the tax savings really are n't that appealing to do it just for those

i 've been thinking about this   here 's what i came up with   please let me know what you think     1 the whole world is on a fiat money system   the central banks were all easing together in a coordinated way   so currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other also the price of goods is n't rising nearly as quickly as the money supply is being expanded because    2 the growth of the internet globalization are deflationary because skilled people in poor countries have access to the global marketplace and are willing to produce far more per dollar than rich country citizens   3 the growth of inequality is deflationary   as wealth concentrates at the top there are fewer and fewer customers who can afford the products services that are being mass produced   so there 's a mismatch between high supply and low demand   4 a poor slow economy low spending debt defaults and business personal bankruptcy is deflationary   we treat credit as money and when debt is wiped out so is the credit that we were accounting for in the money supply   5 the money created over the last 10 years or so has n't had a chance to trickle down yet it 's still tied up in financial market instruments stocks bonds etfs etc held by mostly institutional investors until the next big bubble bursts    so there are many deflationary forces to balance out against the money creation

i 'll be happy to edit when you provide answers to the question i posed in the comments   given the choice and i assume there is no other i 'd take a loan from the 401(k vs a withdrawal   you withdraw $ i 'll assume 25 bracket as you 're planning at least a $ 200 k house hopefully your taxable income is above $ 38 k the 25 line for singles the tax and penalty is 35 total federal you net $ and you have $ 40 k less in the retirement account in 40 years at 10 average growth that 's $ 1.8 m you wo n't have in your 401(k and as littleadv stated no deposits for 6 months meaning no matching there 's a few more thousand you 'll lose   you borrow $ 20k. your 401(k will see a return on the $ 20k that 's better than the short bond account 4 5 vs less than 1 you are short $ 6 k but in return have paid no tax no penalty etc i respect those who are strongly anti loan but even they would agree this is the far lesser of 2 evils    the above is pretty generic there are better choices but your cpa friend 's advice is nearly as bad as it gets by the way the tax you 'll save once you have the mortgage has nothing to do with that 10 penalty say you bought the house with cash as many would be happy to do you 'd pay the penalty for the 401(k withdrawal but have no mortgage deduction if you had the 20 you still have a loan and the deduction but no penalty for taking his bad advice   my advice is to take that refund and use it to pay the loan faster

bigco is selling new shares and receives the money from venturo if venturo is offering $ 250k for 25 of the company then the valuation that they are agreeing on is a value of $ 1 m for the company after the new investment is made   if jack is the sole owner of one million shares before the new investment then bigco sells shares to venturo for $ 250k   the new total number of shares of bigco is venturo holds 25 and jack holds 75 the amount that jack originally invested in the company is irrelevant   at the moment of the sale the venturo and jack agree that jack 's stake is worth $ 750k   the value of jack 's stake may have gone up but he owes no capital gains tax because he has n't realized any of his gains yet   jack has n't sold any of his stake   you might think that he has because he used to hold 100 and now he holds 75   however the difference is that the company is worth more than was before the sale   so the value of his stake was unchanged immediately before and after the sale jack agrees to this because the company needs this additional capital in order to meet its potential see why is stock dilution legal for further explanation and another example of this see the question if a startup receives investment money does the startup founder owner actually gain anything your other scenario where venturo purchases existing shares directly from jack is not practical in this situation   if jack sells his existing shares you are correct that the company does not gain any additional capital   an investor would not want to invest in the company this way because the company is struggling and needs new capital

unquestionably i think the priority should be funding retirement through roth k over hsa extra   obviously you need to fund your hsa for reasonable and expected medical expenses   also there is some floor to your more traditional retirement funding beyond that what does one do with excess dollars   given the lack of flexibility and fees it seems clear to do roth ira and 401k. beyond that what then   you may want to decide to take some money home and pay taxes on it   do you have a desire to own rental property or start purchase a business   upgrade your home etc if all those things are taken care of only then would i put money into an hsa ymmv but most people maxing a roth ira alone will have plenty of money for retirement given a reasonable rate of return

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

ca n't totally agree with that volatility trading is just one trading type of many in my opinion it does n't depend on whether you are a professional trader or not   as you might have heard retail traders are said to create noise on the market mainly due to the fact that they are n't professional in their majority so i would assume if an average retail trader decided to trade volatility he would create as much noise as if would have been betting on stock directions basically most types of trading would require a considerable amount of effort spent on fundamental analysis of the underlying be it volatility or directional trading arbitrage trading would be an exception here i guess however volatility trading relies more on trader 's subjective expectations about future deviations whereas trading stock directions requires deeper research of the underlying is it a drawback or an advantage on the other hand side volatility trading strategies cover both upward and downward movements but you can set similar hedging strategies when going short or long on stocks is n't it to i think it is a matter of preference imagine yourself going long on s&p500 since 2009 do you think there are many volatility traders who have outperformed that

mutual funds buy and sell shares in companies in accordance with   the policies set forth in their prospectus not according to the   individual needs of an investor that is when you invest money in or withdraw money from a mutual fund   the manager buys or sells whatever shares that in the manager 's judgement   will be the most appropriate ones consistent with the investment policies thus a large cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable he she must choose only between various large capitalization companies some exchange traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks suppose you will not invest in a company x as a matter of principle unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in x you may well end up having an investment in x at some time because the fund manager bought shares in x. with such an etf   you know what is in the basket and if the basket does not include stock in x   now it will not own stock in x at a later date some exchange traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy thus you will not be investing in x unless x becomes part of the index because standard or poor or russell or somebody changed their minds and the etf buys x in order to track the index finally some etfs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell etf shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the nav of the mutual fund shares for that day which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks bonds etc that the fund owns   so you might end up owning stock in x at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about x.

your premise is false   when you withdraw money from a tax free savings account tfsa there is no   tax   due   yes you can read that again   withdrawals from a tfsa are tax free   they are labeled tax free for a good reason   after tax money is deposited and then from that point forward no tax no tax no tax   on a normal non registered investment or savings account with no special treatment your investment earnings will be taxed whenever gains are realized or income received e.g. dividends or interest   you will necessarily have less in a normal non registered investment or savings account compared to a tfsa as long as the rate of return was positive i.e. growing perhaps you were thinking not of comparing a regular investment account to a tfsa but rather to a registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of an rrsp there is an up front tax deduction then earnings grow tax deferred and then on withdrawal income tax is paid at regular rates   even then with rrsps if your marginal tax rate remains the same over time not necessarily a reasonable assumption but let 's go with it then you should still realize more after tax income from your rrsp than from a normal non registered investment or savings account   though there 's likely an exception case when most income came as qualified dividends and the capital itself has n't appreciated

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

i 'd like to suggest a plan first i know you want to buy a house i get that and that is an awesome goal to work for you need to really sit down and decide why you want a house people often tell we that they want a house because they are throwing their money away renting this is just not true there is a cost of renting that is true but there is also a cost of owning there are many things with a house that you will have to pay for that will add little or no equity value now that equity is nice to have but make no mistake under no circumstance does every dime you put into your house increase its value this is a huge misconception there is interest fees repairs taxes and a bunch of other stuff that you will spend money on that will not increase the value of your home you will do no harm waiting a bit renting and getting to a better place before you buy a house with that out of the way time for the plan note i 'm not saying wait to buy a house i am saying think of these as steps in the large house buying plan get your current debt under control your credit score does n't suck but it 's not good either it 's middle of the road your going to want that higher if you can but more importantly than that you want to get into a pattern of making debt then honoring it the single best advise i can give you is what my wife and i did get a credit card you have one do n't get more and then get into a habit of not spending more on that credit card than you actually have in the bank if you have $ 50 in the bank only spend that on your credit card then pay it in full 100 every payday twice a month this will improve your score quite a bit and will in time get you in the habit of buying only what you can afford unless there has been an emergency you should not be spending more on credit than you actually have your car loan needs to get under control i 'm not going to tell you to pay it off completely but see point 2 your car debt should not be more than you have in the bank this again is a credit building step if you have in the bank and own on your car your ability to get a loan will improve greatly start envelope budgeting there are many systems out there but i like ynab a lot it can totally turn your situation around in just a few months it will also allow you to see your house fund growing breaking point so far this sounds like a long wait but it 's not it also sounds like i am saying to wait to actually buy a house and i 'm not i am not saying get your debt to 0 nor do i think you should wait that long the idea is that you get your debt under control and build a nice solid set of habits to keep it under control a look at your finances at this point now at this point you still have debt but your credit cards are at 0 and have been every payday for a few months your car loan still exists but you have money in the bank to cover this debt and you could pay it off it would eat your nest egg but you could you also have 15k set aside just for the house as you take longer looking for that perfect house that number keeps growing your bank account now has over $ 25,000 in it that 's a good feeling on its own and if you stick with your plan buy your house and put down $ 15k you still have plenty of wiggle room between credit cards that are not maxed out and a $ padding in case the roof falls in again it sounds like i 'm saying wait but i 'm not i 'm saying plan better all of these goals are very doable inside one year a rough year to be sure but doable if you want to do it comfortably then take two years in that time you 're looking searching and learning

its based on demand and supply and what bank think the future rates would be today banks in india have a liquidity crunch as the repo rates by reserve bank of india central bank are high bank want to encourage more people to deposit money and hence are offering higher rates banks also believe that once the inflation is under control the central bank would ease the repo rates this is likely to happen in a years time hence banks one year down want to lower the fixed deposit rates so essentially they would be at loss if they give higher rates for longer periods so they are offering the highest rates for a period of year which motivates more people to invest for a year even if they want to stay invested for long

i do n't have anything definitive but in general positions in a company are not affected materially by what is called a corporate action corp actions can really be anything that affects the details of a stock common examples are a ticker change or exchange change ipo ie a new ticker doing a split or merging with another ticker all of these events do not change the total value of people 's positions if a stock splits you might have more shares but they are worth less per share a merger is quite similar to a split the old company 's stock is converted two the new companies stock at some ratio ie 10 shares become 1 share and then converted to the new symbol shorting a stock that splits is no different you shorted 10 shares but after the split those are now 100 shares when you exit the position you have to deliver back 100 new shares though dollar for dollar they are the same total value i do n't see why a merger would affect your short position the only difference is you are now shorting a different company so when you exit the position you 'll have to deliver shares of the new company back to the brokerage where you borrowed the shares you shorted

basically the idea of an ira is that the money is earned by you and would normally be taxed at the individual rate but the government is allowing you to avoid paying the taxes on it now by instead putting it in the account this tax deferral encourages retirement savings by reducing your current taxable income providing a short term carrot   however the government will want their cut specifically when you begin withdrawing from that account the principal which was n't taxed when you put it in will be taxed at the current individual rate when you take it out when you think about it that 's only fair you did n't pay taxes on it when it came out of your paycheck so you should pay that tax once you 're withdrawing it to live on here 's the rub the interest is also taxed at the individual rate at the time that was a good thing the capital gains rate in 1976 when the regular ira was established was 35 the highest it 's ever been now that 's not looking so good because the current cap gains rate is only 15 however these rates rise and fall cap gains more than individual rates and so by contributing to a traditional ira you simplify your tax bill the principal and interest is taxed at the individual rate as if you were still making a paycheck a roth ira is basically the government trying to get money now by giving up money later you pay the marginal individual rate on the contributions as you earn them it becomes a post tax deduction but then that money is completely yours and the kicker is that the government wo n't tax the interest on it if you do n't withdraw it before retirement age this makes roths very attractive to retirement investors as a hedge against higher overall tax rates later in life if you think that for any reason you 'll be paying more taxes in 30 years than you would be paying for the same money now you should be investing in a roth a normal non ira investment account at first seems to be the worst of both worlds you pay individual tax on all earned wages that you invest then capital gains on the money your investment earns stock gains and dividends bond interest etc whenever you cash out however a traditional account has the most flexibility you can keep your money in and take your money out on a timeline you choose this means you can react both to market moves and to tax changes when a conservative administration tax rates on capital gains you can cash out pay that low rate on the money you made from your account and then the money 's yours to spend or to reinvest you can if you 're and tax savvy use all three of these instruments to your overall advantage when tax rates are high now contribute to a traditional ira and then withdraw the money during your retirement in times where individual tax rates are low when tax rates are low like right now max out your roth contributions and use that money after retirement when tax rates are high use a regular investment account as an overage to roth contributions when taxes are low contribute when the individual rate is low then capitalize and reinvest during times when capital gains taxes are low perhaps replacing a paycheck deduction in annual contributions to a roth or you can simply fold it back into the investment account this is n't as good as a roth but is better than a traditional by capitalizing at an advantageous time you turn interest earned into principal invested and pay a low tax on it at that time to avoid a higher tax later however the market and the tax structure have to coincide to make ordinary investing pay off you may have bought in in the early 90s taking advantage of the lowest individual rates since the great depression while now capital gains taxes are the lowest they 've ever been if you cash out you may not be realizing much of a gain in the first place

the simple answer because you believe every other option can yield greater losses so the thinking is lend it to france you 'll get your money back put your money in a bank and there 's a chance you wo n't get it back if the bank goes bust investors also believe that rates will continue to go more negative in which case they will actually make money   it 's a momentum play which will eventually reverse but since the bond market is extremely liquid it 's a bet that can quickly be unwound another theory floating around is that if the weaker countries of the euro leave e.g. greece etc and the core keep the euro then the value of the euro will actually rise so by putting your money in french or german bonds you would also be securing cash in french or german euro 's thinking the on a euro break up

dan 's link he deleted his answer btw is fine it showed the components of the score fico offers   each input has data behind it a bell curve of the behaviors and risk of the person behind it for example we 've discussed utilization many time here the ideal utilization is not 0 but 1 19 this does not mean paying interest or carrying charges from month to month   say i had just one card with a $ 10 k limit i 'd want to be sure i never ran a bill above $ 2000 if i did i 'd see a slight drop in my score and next month it would go back to normal in my case i have enough available credit that going over 20 is rare and if it happened i 'd pay the bill down before the bill was issued just make a mid cycle payment   fico decided that those who go over 20 have a higher risk of default and it gets higher as it goes up same with every aspect of the score 's components   you are comparing us to non us use in the us it seems far more common to use our cards in my family 's case we use very little cash and run most of our spending through our cards   as far as the david is concerned one should separate those who carry a balance from those who pay in full the pay in full users are better off for their habits and responsible card use in the us it 's not easy to rent a car or book a hotel with no card cards offer a cash rebate that adds up fast and purchase protection from fraudulent vendors they also offer extended warranty coverage   the david and others claim that studies prove those using cards spend 10 15 more than cash buyers this is a proven fact from scientific studies only they do n't exist the best i 've seen proves that college kids given a $ 20 bill spend more carefully than those given a $ 20 credit card this does n't extrapolate to a family budget and never will but that quote has a way of being repeated as fact yes it 's non sense thank you for reading and quoting my blog i recognize the quote   the report also shows accounts that have gone to collection an electric bill is n't a regularly reported item it 's assumed your lights are on but if you stop paying the bill and they send your account to a collection agency you 'll see it hit your report   in response to the comment below journal of experimental psychology applied article titled monopoly money the effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior runs 13 pages but on the first page offers do consumers spend differently when using one payment mode relative to another mode for example do consumers spend more when they receive $ 50 in the form of a gift card than in the form of cash if indeed they do then why this research addresses these issues   $ 50 a $ 50 gift card is a nuisance i try to use it up within hours of getting one as i stated above the behavior of a person with such a card does n't scale to a many thousand per month budget such articles in my opinion are nonsense proving nothing   unfortunately this is a bit of a tangent to the original question and if i put up a stand alone is it a fact that people spend more if using a card than cash the question would result in being closed as one that 's seeking opinions not facts

ira is a tax deferred account i.e. you 're not paying any taxes on the income within the account as long as you do n't withdraw it and you can deduct the investment with certain limitation on how much depending on your total agi it is taxed when you withdraw it at ordinary rates for the traditional ira and with 0 rate for roth as long as the withdrawal is qualified if not qualified you pay ordinary rate tax for roth and additional 10 tax for both on the taxable amounts the details are a bit complicated there 's deductible ira non deductible ira roll overs etc etc but that 's the basic regular investment accounts are taxed currently on any income but you get the better capital gains rates on many things so which one is better depends how long your investment is going to be what is your tax situation now and what you anticipate it to be later when you retire

nice work   i would not propose anything related to revenue growth as it will be difficult to tell where that growth came from   if you want a performance aspect you could tie a bonus to particular 's that you both agree to   it could be a website done by a certain time along with a certain amount of likes shares on facebook and instagram followers   yelp and google reviews would probably also be a good place to add value   i would think an insta account would be a no brainer with a tap house so much easy stuff to photo   just my 2 cents if i 'm the owner i want this to be easy so i 'd go for base pay and a bonus

trading at the start of the day is highest because of news flows that may have come after the close of the previous day   and trading at the end of the day is highest because of expected news flows after closing hours moreover there are many day traders who buy in the morning without making any payment for purchase and such traders have to sell by evening or else they will have to make the payment for the purchases which they have made

when you purchase a mortgage you have to prove the source of your down payment   primarily this is so that the mortgage lender knows that there are no other outstanding liens against the property   if you show that some or part of your down payment was a gift there is no fraud but it may affect your qualification for the mortgage consult a lawyer in your area to determine if there is a legal way to gift the money that is not taxed   if all else fails you could just pay the tax   also you should research whether your gift is above the floor of taxable gifts

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

the reason it 's broken out is very specific this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month   it is the only place that 's shown typically each month 's minimum payment is the sum of the interest accrued during that month and some principal say m = and b is your total loan balance   that i is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month you always must pay off the accrued interest   it changes each month as some of the principal is reduced if you have a 3 daily interest rate you owe approximately plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues each month or 30 or 28   since b is going down constantly as principal is paid off i is also going down the p is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time   that 's why p changes each month because it 's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment m than to have a fixed p and variable i for a variable m. as such it 's important to show you the i amount both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged paid and for your tax purposes

in the us stocks are listed on one exchange but can be traded on multiple venues   you need to confirm exactly what your data is showing a trades on the primary listed exchange or b trades made at any venue also the trade condition codes are important   only certain trade condition codes contribute towards the day 's open high low close and some others only contribute towards the volume data   the consolidated tape association is very clear on which trades should contribute towards each value but some vendors have their own interpretation or just simply an erroneous interpretation of the specifications it may surprise you to find that the majority of trading volume for many stocks is not on their primary listed exchange   for example on 2 mar 2015 nasdaq aapl traded a total volume across all venues was shares but trading on nasdaq itself was shares trades can be cancelled   some data vendors do not modify their data to reflect these busted trades    some data vendors also snapshot their feed at a particular point in time of the data   some exchanges can provide data mainly corrections 4 5 hours after the closing bell   by the data too early and throwing away any subsequent data is a typical cause of data discrepancies    some data vendors also round prices volumes but stocks do n't just trade to two decimal places so you may well be comparing two different sets of trades with their own specific inclusion rules against the same stock   you need to confirm with your data sources exactly how they do things disclosure premium data is an end of day daily data vendor

we 're mostly talking about the same thing but if they were trying to mold people for jobs they could be more successful at it instead of requiring general ed classes and offering majors to any possible job the worthwhile majors they offer are n't necessarily all that well aimed at employment concerns either also employers do n't expect colleges to produce trained applicants they expect other employers to do so which is why they place such a premium on previous job experience

there is another reason why an investor might buy negative yielding bonds if the investor expects that bond yields will go even further negative then they are also expecting the price of the bond to go up they can resell the bond later at a profit as an example they may expect an increase in central bank bond purchases to drive yields lower and prices higher

it depends on the way you have directed the order and the execution agreement you have signed with your broker in case of dma direct market access you would direct your order to the specific exchange and that exchange would post your offer assuming you did not tag it as hidden however if you just gave your order to the broker be it via telephone email or even online they may not have to display your order to the market or chose which exchange to sell it on it will also depend where the stock is listed for most us listed and otc stocks regulation applies where your order should have been executed against if it went to the exchanges check your account opening docs and agreements the execution agreement in there it will tell you how your order should be treated in case where the broker stipulates that you have dma or that they will direct your order to lit markets public exchanges and not market making firms and dark pools then you may have a case you would need to request information to exchange your broker sent the order to in case that you gave them discretion on routing of your order read the fine print the answer lies there regarding nbbo missing you quote as suggested above is also a possibility however reg should take care of this do you have stock and date time of your order

so the problem is with universities that grant accounting degrees to people who are incompetent at accounting right and the universities giving out these degrees are pretty much all universities if we can assume that most businesses with more than twenty employees contract an accountant to at least check up on their bookkeeping

i always hesitate to provide an answer to how does this affect my credit score questions because the credit agencies do not publish their formulas and the formulas do change over time and many others have done more reverse engineering than i to figure out what factors do affect the scores to some extent there is no way to know other than to get your credit score and track it over time the credit report will tell you what the largest negative factors are however let me make my prediction you have credit you are n't using a large percentage of it and do n't have defaults late payments so yes i think it would help your credit score and would build a history of credit since this is so unusual this is just an educated guess

not at all from personal experience talking about work culture is a safe bet a smart question to ask is what backgrounds do the people working in position shows you 're interested and willing to to fit into the role plus it gives you an idea of what you need to work towards to get the position   you can also talk about the job description and how it matches your background skills interests i.e i 'm interested in financial modelling because i took xxx class read up about it through book do n't expect them to answer very industry specific questions because in most cases they wo n't be able to you can also ask them about full time programs
