you are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process   i recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books if you still feel like you can generate after tax after expenses alpha returns in excess of the market returns take a shot at some active investing   if you actively invest i recommend the core satellite approach invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account   carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns to truly understand a text like the intelligent investor you need to understand finance and accounting   for example the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise total shares outstanding times price per share divided by the earnings of the business   at a high level earnings are just revenue less cogs less operating expenses less taxes and interest   earnings depend on a company 's revenue recognition inventory accounting methods fifo lifo purchase price allocations from acquisitions etc   if you do n't have a business degree business background i do n't think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge unless you have the discipline to read textbooks   i learned these concepts by completing the chartered financial analyst program

i got a ba in econ from a mid tier public school in ca and i graduated near the trough of the great recession so my experience may not represent what current and future graduates can expect it took a couple of years of shit jobs but i eventually got into banking a matter of who you know and after almost 5 years i could n't stand it anymore so i am starting my ms in econ at an also mid tier public ca school i ca n't compare to cs and my advice will differ from 's   1 never assume that jobs will we thrown at you especially a job that you actually want like and will make a career the job market is strong and you ought to be able to get an entry level analyst position if you can show you have strong econometrics many schools require you to do a research paper for your senior seminar instead of a graduation exam i recommend to choose a topic with good data available   2 all the government jobs i 've looked at required at least a master 's that said the roi on a phd is rarely worth it if you have to take on debt to do it you might be able to get your foot in the door with a bachelor 's but you wo n't be able to progress up the job ladder i suggest being a little more open minded about potential employers there are way more options when you consider consulting or business development for larger corporations   3 economics majors make the most out of the social scientists by far last i checked it was 60 80k depending on local market but i imagine that trails cs majors significantly you should be able to afford a decent standard of living in either field so certainly consider more on the basis of what kind of work you get the most satisfaction from   4 with an undergrad degree you will start in local government you may then be able to jump to state and then federal levels after 5 10 years experience but still may find it difficult if you forgo the master 's i have not personally worked as an economist but i do know you will spend a lot of time searching for collecting data writing or using statistical analysis programs to process it and writing up your reports   5 go search analyst on and you 'll find myriad positions in everything from finance to marketing to supply chain etc which ask for degrees in business finance or other related field economics   in my opinion the prestige of the university from which you graduate is secondary to the work you do   assuming you do a research paper if it is kick ass it wo n't matter much if you went to harvard or not check your city county jobs site for internship opportunities since no matter what even getting an entry level job can be difficult if you 've never had any job experience in the field or related field   labor economics is big since there 's a lot of good data and it is a hot topic personally i 'm focusing on urban economics real estate planning and transportation the beauty of econ is that it is so broad you can almost do whatever you want but the drawback is that it is so broad it can be tough to show employers that you possess the specific skills and knowledge that make you desirable   hope this helps

for 1 i see no advantage in putting money from your non retirement savings into a roth just for the purpose of using it as a down payment on your house   why not just put the $ 5.5 k directly toward the down payment for 2 dollars converted from a traditional 401 k or ira to a roth are considered income and will be taxed at your marginal rate   so if your marginal tax rate is 25 you will need to pay $ 5 k in order to convert the $ 20k.   usually this payment is done independent of the conversion amount in other words you would convert the full $ 20 k but pay the $ 5 k in taxes out of other funds checking savings based on your stated goals of using the money for a down payment on a house i do n't see any advantage to contributing or converting to a roth ira

there are lots of things to consider in addition to your questions   the rules changed in the us recently i think you mean you will save more money your interest rate is n't likely to go up but your principle will so you will earn more interest income than before    i would wager it wo n't be a significant amount however you can certainly earn a reward either cash back points miles or something else but the sticking point with earning things with your card is harder than before   due to rules changes merchants can now recuperate the fees they pay for accepting your credit card   rewards cards have a higher fee than non rewards cards because banks are n't in charities   so now depending on the merchant 's choice you could see a higher cost paying with a credit card or a debit card and that cost could wipe out your reward and if your card has a fee it has always been true that you need to evaluate the annual fee to confirm the benefit is more than paying for the fee additional advantages to credit cards

unlike others who have answered the question i have done this   here is my experience your mileage and friendship may vary i bought a condo years ago with a longtime childhood friend   we did it for all the reasons you mentioned sick of renting and not building equity were both young single professionals who had the money   the market crashed we have both since married and moved on to own other properties with our spouses   now we rent out the condo as selling in the current market is not doable   it 's not an ideal situation but that is because of the real estate market not who i bought with you need to discuss very openly all of the following scenarios as well as others i ca n't think of right now i am sure if you are n't both 100 in sync with these questions then do not do it i never understand why some people would buy with a girlfriend boyfriend but not a good personal friend   you 're more likely to have a falling out with your significant other then a long time close friend   my advice have honest open conversations about all possible scenarios   if you feel necessary put somethings down into some sort of legal agreement with us it was not and still is n't necessary

at least with us tax law where you only pay taxes at the higher rate for the income above the minimum for that tax bracket you will always wind up ahead taking the raise if you are simply concerned with after tax fica income   for example assume you were making $ the top end of the 10 bracket in the us and got a $ 100 raise you would be taxed roughly as follows after tax income before raise $ x 100 10 after tax income after raise $ x +   $ 100 x you can easily see that the second number is always higher than the first as long as the raise is a positive amount obviously

china is in the middle of a residential housing bubble and now is probably a horrible time to invest in real estate in china   even if china was n't near the peak of its bubble it would probably still be a bad idea because owning real estate in a foreign country is expensive and risky there are real currency risks think what would happen if the yuan declined significantly against the dollar there is also the risk of the government seizing foreign held investments not extremely likely but plausible another consideration is that it would be next to impossible for you to get a loan to purchase a property us banks would n't touch it with a 10 ft pole and i doubt chinese banks would be very interested in lending to foreigners

you should start by making a written complaint to the insurance company itself you have two angles of attack what was discussed when she was sold the policy make sure you set out exactly what you believe you were told and highlight that they did n't ask about commuting assuming that 's the case ask them to preserve any recordings they have of the call and to send you a copy the nature of the journey where the accident happened from the description unless it was part of a journey to and from work there 's no good reason for them to classify it as commuting make sure you make good written notes now of anything that happened verbally phone calls etc and keep doing this as the process goes along if that written complaint does n't work your next step is to go to the financial ombudsman who are a neutral service if the ombudsman does n't support your case you could go to court directly but it 'll be expensive and a lot of effort and by this stage it 'd be unlikely you would win the ombudsman 's rejection would n't count against you directly but it 'd be a strong indication that your case is weak see for a more detailed walk through

it would be the sales revenue less everything else when he says reinvest that is to say they keep all of the post tax earnings and place it in retained earnings this means that it is still the companies money to invest and use to fulfill their goals if they did n't have any worthy investing opportunities they could issue dividends so say your cost of capital is 15 and the best investment you can make will earn you 12 that 's a loss of value so the company acting in the investors best interests will give those funds back so that the investors can allocate that money to more efficient areas dividends are one mechanism a company has to control their rate of growth

typically your statement will break down each of the balances that carry a different rate so you 'll see them lumped into the 0 line or two separates lines with different rates for each if you do n't see it on the statement a quick call to your bank should clarify it for you if i had to guess i would lean towards the fee likely being at 0 also but if it is n't typically you would pay the minimum + $ 350 on your next statement because only amounts over the minimum go towards principal of the highest rates first at least this is true in the us for personal accounts of course this is something your bank should be able to clarify as well balance transfer tip i always recommend setting up automatic payments when you take advantage of a balance transfer offer the reason is oftentimes buried deeply in the terms and conditions is an evil phrase which says that if you miss a payment they have the right to revoke the promotional rate and start charging you a higher rate that would be bad enough if it happened but to make things worse i believe the fee you paid for the transfer is not returned to you so set up an auto payment each month for at least the minimum payment and if you can afford it divide the total transferred by the number of months and pay that amount each month assuming you do n't pay interest on the fee $ 17,500 1.02 18 = $ month that way you 'll have it paid off just in time to not have any higher interest when the promotional rate expires if you do n't know if you can afford the higher amount each month set it to the max you know for sure you can afford and make additional payments whenever you can

i am going to add in an opinion here from the wall street journal that i read this morning in what 's at stake in the greek vote in light of current events and elections in greece the article claims that if the election results make it sound like a break from the euro is imminent then we will see a full fledged bank run greek banks would collapse the market exchange rate would likely be two or three drachmas to the euro which would double or triple the greek price of imported goods within a few days prices of assets including real estate assets would crumble those who moved their deposits abroad would be able to buy these assets cheaply leading to a significant regressive redistribution of greek wealth in short you 'd lose two thirds of your savings unless you were storing them somewhere safe from the conversion the article also predicts difficulty importing goods other nations will demand to be paid in euro not drachma leading to disruption of trade and various supply shortages   i will note that the predictions here seem to be in opposition to some other advice here which suggests that real estate will be an effective hedge

best as i can tell the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is has and will continue to make a solid profits there are lots of them out there specifically companies with no debt a history of long term and steady growth and a stable market share will almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout and usually in short order this is why dividends were created as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company the trick then is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout and again there are a lot of good options out there   all the is justified however as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above instead high debt fluctuating or negative profits minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor

let 's look at basics your 340 k mortgage amortized over 25 years at 3.5 is going to cost you $ 1700 in payments almost exactly your rent you wo n't be paying out less you will in fact be paying out more because you are now liable for more insurance and any repairs will have to be paid for by you not the landlord so do n't do this to save money figures from here do n't forget that it is extremely likely that interest rates will go up in the next few years 7 is not unlikely can you afford it if your payments double you can get a fixed rate mortgage but they are going to cost you much more than 3.5 for more than a couple of years do n't be fooled by the pay yourself argument for getting a mortgage in the first few years almost all of your payments is interest not paying down the principal you are just switching from paying a landlord to paying a bank there are huge advantages to waiting until you have a good down payment before buying a house people with a big down payment get better interest rates and do n't need to pay as much cmhc insurance you will be less at risk if the price of your house drops also ask yourself if you are sure you will be in your house for five years if not even real estate agents would usually admit you should n't buy the truck payment should n't be an issue as long as you are sure you can service both truck and mortgage payments nor is $ 600 in credit card debt significant in the big scheme i would probably put any spare cash towards a down payment it reduces your interest rate possibly some expenses with regard to your mortgage and your risk if you have to sell and your house value has dropped   you might like to look at the government of canada website rent or buy it 's down right now so i ca n't give you a link i 'll edit it in when it 's back up edit turns out it 's offline for updating here 's the link

any etf has expenses including fees and those are taken out of the assets of the fund as spelled out in the prospectus   typically a fund has dividend income from its holdings and it deducts the expenses from the that income and only the net dividend is passed through to the etf holder    in the case of qqq it certainly will have dividend income as it a large stock index   the prospectus shows that it will adjust daily the reported net asset value nav to reflect accrued expenses and the cash to pay them will come from the dividend cash   if the dividend does not cover the expenses the nav will decline away from the modeled index note that the nav is not the etf price found on the exchange but is the underlying value   the price tends to track the nav fairly closely both because investors do n't want to overpay for an etf or get less than it is worth and also because large institutions may buy or redeem a large block of shares to profit when the price is out of line   this will bring the price closer to that of the underlying asset e.g. the nasdaq 100 for qqq which is reflected by the nav

credit cards are often more fool proof against over drawing consider bill has solid cash flow but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest an account that does n't have a card but is accessible via online banking bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending much of which comes out automatically e.g. rent utilities some of which he spends as needed eg shopping lunch on top of the day to day money bill keeps an overhead amount so if something happens he does n't overdraw the account which would incur significant fees now bill sees that the giant tv he has been saving for is on sale half price and there is just one left it costs more than he would normally spend in a week much more but bill knows that his pay should have just gone in and his rent not yet come out plus the overhead he keep in the account so there is money in his debit account when he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings after all the tv is what he was saving for what bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated and that his pay is going to go in a day late so now he might have over drawn the account buying the tv or maybe that was fine but paying the rent over draws the account now he has a overdraft fee probably on the order of $ 50 most banks at least where i am will happily allow you to overdraw you account giving you a loan at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee they do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the non assessed loan sometimes if you ask they do n't let you do it with your own eg buying the tv but they do let you do it on automated eg the rent on the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card they know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take if bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card then it would have just bounced at the cash register and bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money there are many ways you can accidentally overdraw your account particularly if it is a shared account

first of all just for the sake of clarity the federal reserve does n't actually print money that 's the job of the what they do is they buy us treasury bonds i.e. loan money to the us government the money they do it with are created from thin air just by adding some numbers in certain accounts thus it is described as printing money the us government then spends the money however it wishes to the idea is that this money is injected into the economy since the only way the us government can use the money from these loans is to spend them on buying something or give it to some people that would spend them   as it is a loan sometime in the future the us government would pay these loans back and in this moment the fed would decide if they want to contract the supply of money back they just destroy the money they 've got by the numbers they created before they could also do it by selling the bonds they hold on the open market and then again destroy the money they got as proceeds thus lowering the amount of money existing in the economy this way the fed can control how much money is out there and thus supposedly influence inflation and economic activity   the fed could also inject money in the economy by buying any assets after creating the money for example right now they own about a trillion dollars worth of various mortgage based securities but since buying specific security would probably give unfair advantage to the issuers and owners of this security usually us treasury bonds if what they buy the side effect of increased supply of money denominated in dollars would be as you noted devaluation of dollars compared to other currencies

you could conceivably open a few accounts   for example a bank account and a credit card account   then the accounts will be older when evaluated for credit when you return   this would look better than opening fresh accounts later   but do n't expect a big difference in score   and you 'll be stuck with those accounts in the future otherwise you lose the benefit   i would n't worry about maintaining balances now   you can wait until you come back   occasional purchases may be helpful    what they really want to see is a regular and sustained use of accounts without missing payments or   but if you 're not going to be here you ca n't really do that   note that good credit scores are based on seven years of data preferably a lot of it   opening a few accounts ca n't substitute for that even if you put balances on them    if you 're not here you wo n't be paying rent or utilities   you wo n't have a proven payment history on the most common accounts    if money were no object you could do something like purchase a house or condo that you could rent out utilities included   that would build up a payment history   but if money were no object you probably would n't be worried about your credit score   it 's more practical to just live normally and be sure that you always live within your means so that you do n't experience negative credit events    you might think about why you want a good credit score   is it to borrow a lot of money   you might be able to spend money to achieve that   is it to save money on future borrowing   if it costs money now how much will you save total    opening accounts now that you wo n't really use until you return is about the only thing that you can do that wo n't cost you money   perhaps put a balance on the bank account at least you 'll get that money back some day   maintaining a balance on the credit cards would cost you money in interest charges and you do n't really benefit from an improved credit score until you use your credit   so the interest fees are n't really buying you anything

almost all unions want the business they are in to survive most of the stories you hear are such an extreme outlier or just plain made up   believe it or not everyone in the union wants the corp to survive to pay them retirement benefits they do nt want to rape the corp like corps rape resources   they want fair pay they want pay to go up when the company does better just like companies tend to demand pay cuts or fire people when the company does worse   quit treating people like a commodity and instead treat them like actual people helping your actual corp to actually grow

the problem is that every option comes with risk as you note if you put money in stocks you could lose and many stocks are overpriced   if you put money in bonds you could lose many bonds are overpriced   if you buy precious metals they could fall further currently   if you hold cash central banks might try to ban cash we 'll hear the typical this will never happen from financial advisers and they 'll be wrong   cryptocurrencies are an option but boy do they fluctuate so there 's risk here too those are options and all come with risks and here 's my preferred approach to handling negative interest rates

a rather good irs paper on the topic states that a donation of a business in kind inventory would be   under irc however the fair market value must be    reduced by the amount of gain that would not be long term capital gain if the    property had been sold by the donor at the property 's fair market value determined    at the time of the contribution under this rule deductions for donated inventory    are limited to the property 's basis generally its cost where the fair market value    exceeds the basis   there are references to irc regulations in a narrative context you may find helpful this paper goes on for 16 pages describing detailed exceptions and the political reasons for the exceptions most of which are concerned with encouraging the donation of prepared food from restaurants to hunger charities by guaranteeing a value for something that would otherwise be trashed valueless and a worked out example of that had a cost of goods of $ 200 and a market value of $ 1000

1 link 2 it does n't matter if they can or do what matters is if they are investing not trading in it more than banks are investing in businesses if that is the case it is then businesses as a whole will see the inflation first and commodities will be playing the entire time but mostly when the investments hit recession   i will invest in the market again after they lose their invested value in historical terms the best time was to invest in them was 1980 1938 and 1900 and the best time to get out was 1929 1960 's and 2000 but to bet against them right now with the dollar is meaningless because the fed is deflating the currency as they go down so it 's like running on a treadmill by holding silver i am essentially short the market only difference is instead of holding a devaluing currency cash i 'm holding a real money which is increasing in value   there 's nothing simpler than investing in commodities for the long term people lose when they are making monthly daily trades in them anyone who bought and held on to gold in 2000 did it for $ 300 and they 've made infinitely more than the majority of people investing in blue chips because they 've lost value and much more than those who invested in bonds and that trend is n't going to stop unless the government lets the dollar deflate in which case the dollar will come to gold instead of the other way around until they are in equilibrium again historically the dow has an average of being 2 ounces of gold peaking at 50 and at .5 if it hits .5 again like it has everytime this occurs in the past then either gold will be $ 20000 or the dow will be 4000 you pick

unfortunately there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to time the market i will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless on the other hand fundamental analysis has some merits for example the realization that cdos were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy cdss however there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell the market behaves like a random 50/50 motion there are many reasons for this and interestingly there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all depending on your goal you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift on the other hand i feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active you will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying   not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products remember volatility brings higher levels of correlation my second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your p l giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example ground your trades with fundamental beliefs if need be but use your tools and knowledge to combat risks that may create long periods of drawdown

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

you can be a co borrower on the property that your father owns some banks require that you also be part owner of the property some banks do not require this you can take a home loan for a new property normally banks will ask you of all your current loans auto other home etc to determine the amount they will be ready to lend edit the first loan i believe your father already has a property in his name your father can apply for loan against property if he does not have sufficient income then you can guarantee the loan ie co sign on the loan some banks allow this however there is no tax benefit on this loan      the second is the home loan for the balance amount that you would get it both the loans can be taken from the same bank there would be a overall cap as to the amount of loan a bank would give depending on your income further the finance for this house will only be to the extent of 80 of the value

first keep about six months expenses in immediately available form savings account or similar second determine how long you expect to hold on to the rest of it   what 's your timeframe for buying a house or starting a family   this determines what you should do with the rest of it if you 're buying a house next year then a cd certificate of deposit is a reasonable option low ish interest but something probably roughly inflation level and quite safe and you can plan things so it 's available when you need it for the down payment if you 've got 3 5 years before you want to touch this money then invest it in something reasonably safe   you can find reasonable funds that have a fairly low risk profile usually a combination of stock and bonds with a few percent higher rate of return on average   still could lose money but wo n't be all that risky if you 've got over five years then you should probably invest them in an etf that tracks a large market sector in the us i 'd suggest voo or similar vanguard 's s&p 500 fund i 'm sure australia has something similar which tracks the larger market   risky but over 5 + years unlikely to lose money and will likely have a better rate of return than anything else 6 or higher is reasonable to expect   five years is long enough that it 's vanishingly unlikely to lose money over the time period and fairly likely to make a good return accept the higher risk here for the greater return and do n't cringe when the market falls as it will go up again   then when you get close to your target date start pulling money out of it and into cds or safer investments during up periods

with a question like this you should talk to a tax professional who knows about international tax and knows about both the uk and the country you will be working in they will give you up to date advice on what can be an extremely complex question however to get you started i 'll tell you what i was told when i did this nearly twenty years ago it 's all about whether you are resident in the uk for tax purposes or not if you are you will pay uk tax if not you wo nt assuming you are being paid outside the uk check with your professional exactly what is involved in those days you could be counted as non resident if you spent a complete period of twelve months outside the uk you can make occasional visits to the uk without that again check exactly how much you are allowed to return while still being not resident usually you will have to pay tax in the country where you are resident but check the rules there with some timing you may be able to be considered non resident in countries at least for some of the time again your tax professional will know the bank account question again get a professional i do n't think it 's a problem but you may have to establish that you are being paid in the foreign country in general you are going to need an account in the country where you work so if its a problem get paid there and transfer any money you need in the uk

a few ideas i suggest it would wise to consider what lesson is learned as a result of any resolution of a financial issue is it a lesson of responsibility and of the importance of keeping one 's word or of getting away with whatever happens poorly planned business with no adverse consequences no consequences e.g. forgiven loan is also a consequence and it sends a message sounds like paying the loan from your savings automatically means it 's deducted from inheritance since the savings are part of that inheritance this may seem like a square deal if we ignore inflation assuming today the $ 54 k is worth much more than unless it is adjusted for inflation the same $ 54 k will be worth i.e. will allow to buy a few decades from now when the inheritance   so this option means your son is foregoing a significantly smaller financial loss in the future in exchange for foregoing his debt completely today this is like borrowing $ 54 k from a bank now and only having to forego the same amount decades in the future when it is in fact worth much less what borrower would not be happy with such arrangement and what lender would do it only one 's own loving parents you are in charge of what life lessons your son will walk away with from this situation good luck

the strategy could conceivably work if you had sufficient quantity of shares to fill all of the outstanding buy orders and fill your lower buy orders   but in this case you are forcing the market down by selling and reinforcing the notion that there is a sell off by filling ever lower buy orders   there is the potential to trigger some stop loss orders if you can pressure it low enough   there is a lot of risk here that someone sees what you are doing and decides to jump in and buy forcing the price back up   could this work sure   but it is very risky and if you fail to create the panic selling then you risk losing big   i also suspect that this would violate sec rules and several laws   and if the price drops too far then trading on the stock would be halted and is likely to return at the appropriate price bottom line i can not see a scenario where you do not trigger the stop net a profit and end up with as many or more stock that you had in the first place

two main points to answer this in my opinion first most people do n't start with say half a million dollar to buy all the stocks they need in one shot but rather they accumulate this money gradually so they must make many buys in their lifetime similarly most people do n't need to withdraw all their investment in one day and should n't do this anyway as it cuts the time of investment so there will be many sells performing a single buy or sell per year is not efficient since it means you have lots of cash sitting doing nothing so in this sense low cost indexing lets you quickly invest your money and withdraw it when needed after say you retire without worrying about commission costs each time the second and most important point to me to answer this is that we should make a very clear distinction between strategy and outcome today 's stock prices and all the ups and downs of the market are just one possible outcome that materialized from a virtually number of possible outcomes it 's not too hard to imagine that tomorrow we hear all iphones explode and apple stock comes crashing down or that in a parallel universe amazon never takes off and somehow sears is the king of online commerce another item in the outcome category is your decisions as a human being of when to buy and sell if that exploding iphone event does occur would you hold on to your stocks would you sell and cut your losses does the average person make the same decision if they had $ 1000 invested in apple alone vs $ 1 m   index investing offers a low cost strategy that mitigates these uncertainties for the average person again here the key is the word average picking a handful of the stocks as you mention might give you better returns in 30 years but it could just as easily give you worse and the current data suggest the latter is more likely come and go who were they 30 years ago and just like how the other 450 companies may seem right now as dragging down the portfolio just as easily a handful of them can emerge as the new guaranteed no possible yes   jack bogle is simply saying low cost indexing is one of the better strategies for the average person given the data but nowhere is it guaranteed that in this lifetime e.g. next 30 years will provide the best outcome berkshire on the other hand are in the business of chasing maximum outcomes mid or short term returns it 's two different concepts that should n't be mixed together in my opinion

from my experience payments from banks and other financial entities such as loyalty programs generally are n't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank thus keeping a bank account open simply for some reward loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons the more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ach payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services perhaps the biggest tell that you 're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account   for example if you had a direct deposit to your bmo bank account make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account if you 're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account you should n't need to move the auto loan but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account   some financial advisors such as in this bankrate article titled lenders can tap bank account for mortgage even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations if for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what 's in your checking account to avoid getting nickel and to death by payment processing fees i tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi annually thus consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months if so you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head it 's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late if all that is in order close the account

generally unless you explicitly elect otherwise llcs are transparent when it comes to taxes so the money in the llc is your money for tax purposes there 's no need to pay yourself a salary in fact the concept of salary for llc members does n't exist at all it is either distributions or guaranteed payments and even that is mostly relevant to multi member llcs the only concern is the separation of personal and llc finances avoiding commingling mixing your personal and business expenses by using the same accounts cards for both business and personal spending may cause troubles when it comes to the liability protection in case of a lawsuit i 'd suggest discussing this with a fl licensed attorney bottom line technically the withdrawal is just writing yourself a check from the business account or moving money between your personal and business accounts if you 're a sole member you need not more than that make sure the operating agreement explicitly you to do that of course there are no tax consequences but as i mentioned there may be legal consequences

i think the key concept here is future value   the nav is essentially a book keeping you add up all the assets and remove all the liabilities   for a public company this is spelled out in the balance sheet and is generally listed at the bottom   i pulled a recent one from cisco systems because i used to work there and know the numbers   and you can see it here roughly $ 56 billion   another way to think about it in theory and we know about this right the nav is what you would get if you liquidated the company instantaneously   a definition i like to use for market cap is the current assets plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company so let 's that a little   the term present value is really important because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year   a company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more i.e. a higher market cap than a company expected to make the same amount of money but later   the all future earnings part is exactly what it sounds like   so again following our cisco example the current market cap is billion which means that the market thinks they will earn about $ 85 billion over the life of the company in present day dollars

its called a grace period and you are not paying interest on the 0 bt you are paying interest on the amount you spent in purchases if you do not pay your balance in full by the due date your grace period ends this means that you have to pay interest on the purchased amount from the day it is made this is why when you do a balance transfer the card should be put in the sock drawer until the bt is paid off in order to restore the grace period you must pay the balance in full and the grace period will start during the next payment cycle lets assume statement cuts on the 1st and due date is the 20th you make the minimum payment of $ 10 balance now is $ 100 since you have a balance of $ 100 from the previous statement and a new purchase of $ 50.00 when the next statement cuts you will have to pay interest according to the terms on the $ 50.00 portion in order to get the grace period back you will have to pay in full and wait for the next cycle in case i did not explain it well here is a quote from dot com website the cost of carrying a balance    this is because carrying a balance of    any size into the next billing cycle means there is no grace period on    your purchases during that cycle the card company will begin charging    interest on your purchases the day you make them so leaving even $ 1    in unpaid balance on your card will cost you considerably more than    the measly finance charges on that dollar to see how this works let 's consider an imaginary card user named    sally she 's so happy she got a new credit card that she charges    $ 1,500 in purchases on the first day of her monthly billing cycle    after the cycle ends sally pays off the entire $ 1,500 by the due    date wiping her balance to zero as a result her purchases during    the second month are also free of interest she has used her grace    period wisely to avoid finance charges what happens if sally leaves just $ 1 of her balance from the first    month unpaid that $ 1 begins to accrue interest starting the first day    of the billing cycle it 's just $ 1 so the interest is not a big deal    but because she used up her grace period without paying off her entire debt her new purchases during the second month also start to    get hit with interest charges immediately starting the day of the    transaction assuming she makes another $ 1,500 in purchases at the    average annual interest rate of about 13 percent that means $ 16 in    finance charges for the month if sally repeats this pattern the    interest costs add up to $ 190 over the course of a year

cfds should not be used as a buy and hold strategy which is risky enough doing with shares directly however with proper money and risk management and the proper use of stop losses a medium term strategy is very plausible   i was using cfds in the past over a short time period of usually between a couple of days to a couple is weeks trying to catch small swings with very tight stops i kept getting due to my stops being too tight so had too many small loses for my few bigger wins and yes i lost some money almost $ 5k in one year i have recently started a more medium term strategy with wider stops trying to catch trending stocks i have only recently started this strategy and so far have 2 loses and 3 wins just remember that you do get charged a financing fee for holding long position overnight buy for short position you actually get paid the funding fee for overnight positions my broker charges the official interest rate + 2.5 for long positions and pays the official rate 2.5 for short positions so yes cfds can be used for the longer term as long as you are implementing proper money and risk management and use stop losses just be aware of the implications of using margin and all the costs involved

great work so far and good question   i think a lot of it depends on how risky your financial life is    for example lets say that you are working a temp or contract job that ends in 3 months   that is also the same month your savings and student loan will be equal   i think most would agree that it would be foolish to empty out your savings in such a risky month    now same situation one month later   the company you were working for takes you on as a full time employee   i would go ahead and empty out my savings and make the student loan go away    there could be other risks to consider like needing a different car moving to a new place potential medical bills or a needing to travel   anything like that on the horizon i would hold off out my savings   however once it is smooth sailing go for it being debt free is wonderful and it is a worthy goal

it is not unheard of celebrity investors such as warren buffet and carl icahn gained by more than doubling investments some years with a few very stellar trades and bets doubling as in a 100 gain is actually conservative if you want to play that game as 500 1200 and greater gains are possible and were achieved by the two otherwise unrelated people i mentioned this reality is opposite of the comparably pitiful returns that warren buffet teaches baby boomers about but compounding on 2 5 gains annually is a more likely way to build wealth it is unreasonable to say and expect that you will get the outcome of doubling an investment year over year

first of all you 'll need a securities account nowadays most large banks offer this as a standard product for all their customers though it may require some extra paperwork then you need to buy shares in the etf this is indeed typically done through the stock market but there are alternatives some banks will sell securities to you directly but usually only those they create themselves options and such some also offer etf investment plans that allow you to buy shares for a fixed amount each month through the bank in any case the bank 's online banking interface should support all these options however fees are an important consideration with some banks the securities account is free others charge an annual fee and the fees on stock market transactions and investment plans also vary considerably so it could be worth it to consider some alternatives

the most important thing is not to tell yourself i 'll save more later in my career when i have more disposable income because of two factors 1 you will get raises over your career but unless you make it big it will never really feel like you have extra money you may double or triple your salary over a career but it usually happens in small increments which your lifestyle tends to adjust upwards to meet even though it does n't feel like it 2 later in your career you may have more money to save but now the commodity you have is time your total savings at retirement are going to be influenced in a massive way by both of these factors a good strategy is save something early in your career even if it feels like an insignificant amount then save larger amounts later in your career when you are earning more but have less time for your investments to grow and less tolerance for high risk high growth investments

chit funds started as group of people pooling money every month and drawing a lot to determine who would get the entire funds that month for example 5 people pool together rs on first month person a gets the draw and takes the rs next month again same set of people pool rs the person who got the money last month is removed from the list and again a draw is made thus everyone pays rs for 5 month and gets back rs some sooner and some later this was done more to buy big ticket purchases or group of ladies getting together there is always a leader who would ensure that everyone pays and manages the process in more business oriented chit fund unknown people come together and contribute rs there is a who is a local strong man who runs this and ensures that everyone pays the variation here is that every month instead of a lucky draw you can buy for discount say this month you need the money badly you are willing to take only rs there maybe some one who is more desperate and may say he is ok with only rs the balance rs 400 is distributed amongst the other 4 members thus the other who had contributed rs over 5 months now get rs 100 more the next month this person is eliminated from bidding and others 4 can bid for rs 5000 or less the balance is again re distributed amongst others this is typically run by people who do not get loans at good rates from bank and essentially borrow outside the financial industry the people who are part of this most of the times make good returns better than banks but this entire industry is unregulated and hence the strong man can dupe you there are cases where people who take the first shot at money vanish without trace every city has quite a few of such funds running it is advisable you do not indulge in such funds

all of the other answers here are accurate but i think are missing the point as to the question which rests on how bonds work in the first place the bond specifies a payback amount and date let 's say it is $ 10,000 and one year from today if you buy that today for $ your yield will be 1 if you buy it today for $ 11,000 your yield will be less than 0 please do n't make me do the math it 's just under negative 1 you might be willing to pay that 1 rather than receive 1 for the certainty that you will definitely get your money back the combined actions of all the people who may be willing to pay a little more or a little less for the safety of a us treasury bond is what people call the market   market forces generally investor confidence will drive the price up and down which affects the yield all the other stuff coupons and inflation and whatnot all of that only makes sense if you understand that you are n't buying a rate of return you are buying a payback amount and date

they already do it is just sneaky how it is done   they have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country   they do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits   they do n't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders   that is without even getting into and prohibition legislation   one way they could easily keep money flowing to hollywood would be an additional tax refund that applies to legitimate entertainment costs   or perhaps doing as canada does and adding taxes to storage media   they can also continue to cut web freedom options and bandwidth   every bit of legislation i see come down the pipe with only a couple of notable exceptions such as has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile at the expense of everyone else   edit   i would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare and in fact we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes   it is so hyper inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels     we have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system   this chart in particular shows the problem     this was just in 2008 costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate   so yes the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation

that depends on where how you 're charging a model 3 with a battery will take less time to charge than a 75kwh battery    supercharger charges at so the charge times would be    = hours = 27.5 minutes   75kwh = hours = minutes   the appeal of an ev though is charging at home if a user has a 14 50 installed that does maximum it offers of charging so    = 6.25 hours    75kwh = hours   other options exist for charging at home such as the high power wall charger could do or    = hours    75kwh = hours   the time to charge issue is more relevant for road trips since the the average driver does less than 200 miles per day and their car spends more time at home potentially plugged into a charger than driving i have a battery in my tesla and it 's nice to know that i could drive it to empty and then charge back up fully once i get home better yet it will charge completely to full in about the amount of time i should be sleeping at home    the range anxiety is closely tied to the charging concerns and with the tesla supercharger network doubling by year 's end and continuing to grow both tesla 's charging network as well as other plug in options like blink ev go etc charging is less of a gamble and more of just simple planning apps like allow you to see crowd sourced reports of ev plugs what types they use type of charging available cost availability and more you can plan your drive to use superchargers on the road and then plan your destination or evening stop in a place with charging capability i think it 's only a matter of time before destination chargers develop a system like what tesla does at many superchargers otherwise by the end of 2017 you should never be too far from a supercharger an ev charging station or even some kind individual who will lend you some juice to get you where you 're going

i do n't know canada very well but can offer some general points when considering where to park your emergency fund savings rates are currently low but then so is inflation always bear in mind that inflation decreases the value of your money so if you 're getting 4 interest and inflation is 2 you 're making 2 gross in real terms if you 're getting 2 and inflation is close to zero you 're actually earning a similar amount it 's just the numbers are going up more slowly obviously when and how much tax you pay affects the actual return it 's just worth bearing in mind that low interest and low inflation are actually not that bad a savings environment as they first appear for an emergency fund the key thing is ease of access consider keeping some portion of your savings in an instant access account for those emergencies that happen when the banks are closed in the uk there are various tax free savings options i 'm guessing canada has a few too if so you should explore those options while these may not have attractive headline rates you do n't pay tax on the interest this can make them much more competitive 4 tax free is the same as 5 gross if you would have to pay tax at 20 normally tax free investments have caps so once you 've invested a set amount you ca n't add anymore this may be a consideration if you regularly dip into your emergency fund as you might not easily be able to build it up again my approach is to have about 90 of my rainy day fund in easily accessible but tax free savings this discourages me from spending it unless i really need to i then keep a slush fund sufficient to cover every day disasters boiler packing up needing a hire car for a week etc in instant access accounts

yes you did not notice the $ customer down payment the $ 650 acquisition fee the $ 350 disposition fee due at lease termination and the $ 275 security deposit for customers who do not have good enough credit   also a dealer documentary service fee up to $ 150 may be added to the sale price or capitalized cost these charges might or might not add up to the dealer profit margin   you can negotiate the adjusted capitalized cost of $ and the documentary service fee   by doing so you can reduce your up front payment and the dealer profit margin the price mentioned above includes destination charge but excludes state and local taxes tags registration title and insurance   also this is a low mileage lease   if you choose to not purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease you may be charged for excessive wear based on toyota financial services standards for normal use and for mileage in excess of 24,000 miles at the rate of $ 0.15 per mile

you do n't seem to be a big fan of trading as you may think it may be too risky or too time consuming being in front of your computer all day long you also do n't seem to be a fan of buy and hold as you do n't know what your investments will be worth when you need the funds how about a combination of the two sometimes called trend trading or active investing with this type of trading investing you may hold a stock from a couple of months to many years once you buy a stock that is up trending or starting to up trend you hold onto it until it stops up trending you can use a combination of fundamental analysis to find out what to buy and technical analysis to tell you when to buy and when to sell so these are some topics you can start reading up on using a technique like this will enable you to invest in healthy stocks when they are moving up in price and get out of them when they start moving down in price there are many techniques you can use to get out of a stock but the simplest has to be using stop losses and once you learn and set up your system it should not take up much of your time when you actually do start trading investing 2 to 3 hours per week and you can set yourself up that you analyse the market after the close and place any order so they get executed the next trading day without you being in front or the screen all day other areas you might want to read and learn about are writing up a trading plan using position sizing and money management so you do n't in any one single trade and risk management a good book i quite liked is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp good luck

the reason why we have lots of idle capacity is because we have over capitalized   fed has kept rates far too low for far too long and it incorrectly encouraged producers to over build   if rates where not manipulated so much to the low side than producers would not have built so much capacity and utilization would n't be a issue   the low rates also encouraged consumers to take out loans and to also not save so that they could buy excess supply   but all it did was made everyone go into debt to levels and eventually bankruptcy over the last few decades gov and fed reserve have been stimulating printing lowering rates to prevent the vicious cycle from crashing but eventually it crashed under its own weight   we have n't seen the end yet because we need to go down more before we can start gong back up

to the best of my knowledge the uk 's online banking systems look purely at the sort code and account number when routing transfers   the name is not cross checked to ensure it matches this is why it 's so easy to transfers if you make an error entering the numbers and inadvertently enter the details for a valid account belonging to the wrong person so in your case so long as you 're sure you have the correct account number and sort code it does n't matter what you put in the name field it 'll end up in the account to which those numbers apply   of course you might as well put your best guess into the name field since it does n't hurt and in the event that something does go wrong it 's backup evidence of your intentions

you will have to write it off as an offset of capital gains or as bad debt against personal income limited to $ yr write off 3k this year 2k next here 's the tax code you 'll need to file a form 8949 link below so this requires that it is a loan acknowledged by both you and the borrower with terms of repayment and stated interest as well as wording for late payments and time for delinquency   the loan document does n't have to be fancy but it must show a reasonable intention of repayment to distinguish it from a gift   then send out a for cancellation of debt this is a starting point it 's a good idea to run everything by your tax to make sure you 're meeting the requirements for bad debt with your contact and payment communication

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

now my own answer   if you join and receive equity do the 1/3 split as a max truthfully if it were my company i would try to negotiate with you to only give you because as an advisor you 're not going to be involved in executing the idea to turn it into a business   if you contribute capital do it as a loan end of story   you do n't own more because you financed growth you should n't the growth will have come because of the collective performance of the whole team you should get paid back at a fair rate for your investment if the company can handle it i would argue something like 10 interest is reflective of the risk you 're taking with your money   if the finances are so tight that the interest repayment is n't an option do the math behind what you should be paid for the loan in interest and convert that to shares or equity somehow and get paid back for the invested capital   if the company ca n't repay your loan the business model may not be sound enough or developed enough to be investing in to begin with

there is certainly an obligation in some cases of a company to distribute profit either as dividend or a stock buy back activist investors frequently push for one or the other when a company is doing well sometimes to the detriment of future growth in some eyes and can even file shareholder lawsuits saying the company is not doing its duty to its shareholders by simply holding onto cash   apple famously held out from doing either for years under steve jobs and only in the last few years started doing both a large dividend and a share buy back which increases the value of remaining shares as eps then goes up with fewer shares out there   carl icahn for example is one of those investors in apple 's case and in many cases who put significant pressure particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars ultimately a for profit corporation 's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder 's wealth as such it can buy back shares pay dividends sell the company liquidate the company or expand the company at its discretion so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings   companies in their growth phase often do n't return any money and simply reinvest but the long term hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits or the sale of the company

my wife and i maintain seperate accounts we have the bills split between us so that certain bills are paid by one of us and other bills by the other this is not a perfect 50/50 split as we do n't make the same amount of money but comparable enough that neither feels like they 're doing all the bills alone our investments are similar that means we each have a pool of money that we can spend on toys or entertainment as we see fit without overspending once my bills are paid and my savings are paid for the month if i want to go buy some dvds and my wife wants to buy a new lens for the camera we do n't have to agree we just use our own money and do it for us that 's led to minimal friction or arguments over what to spend money on simply because we are n't using the same pool getting it work requires getting the split right and having the mindset that the other person is just as entitled to spend their share of the money as you are to spend yours it really helps to eliminate issues where she spent money that i expected to be able to spend before i could which can happen in a joint account we have no joint accounts only things like the mortgage are in both our names i 've been told by more then one person that how we 're doing it is wrong but it works a lot better for us then trying to combine finances ever did i think it also helps that we 're younger and this seems far less common amongst older couples

businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services businesses sometimes advertise what credit cards they accept by posting some stickers at their door when your credit card is n't among them and you do n't have enough cash with you ask about your card before you order if a business does n't accept your credit card your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere when you already ate there and got into an awkward situation because you assumed that they would accept your card you might also want to write an online review of the place and warn others to bring cash for their visit but please be fair in the review when the food and service are decent a restaurant does n't deserve a one star rating just because they do n't take credit cards note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards it often means additional cost for them in form of but there is also a more shady reason taking payment in cash means that there is no electronic trail of the transaction that makes it far easier for an establishment to their income they might under report it to evade taxes or over report it to launder money both are illegal of course

as an aside why does it seem to be difficult to get a conclusive answer to this question i 'm going to start by trying to answer this question and i think the answer here will help answer the other questions   here is a incomplete list of the challenges involved so my question is is there any evidence that value investing actually beats the market yes there is a lot of evidence that it works and there is a lot of evidence that it does not   's has a great link on this   some rules methods work over some periods some work during others   the most famous evidence for value investing probably comes from fama and french who were very careful and clever in solving many of the above problems and had a large persistent data set but their idea is very different from damodaran 's for instance and hard to implement though getting easier is the whole field a waste of time because of the above problems this is a hard question   some people like warren buffet have clearly made a lot of money doing this   though it is worth remembering a good amount of the money these famous investors make is off of fees for investing other peoples money   if you understand fundamental analysis well you can get a job making a lot of money doing it for a company investing other peoples money   the markets are very random that it is very hard for people to tell if you are good at it and since markets generally go up it is easy to claim you are making money for people but clearly banks and hedge funds see significant value in good analysts so it is likely not entirely random especially if you are a good writer you can make a more money here than most other jobs is it worth it for the average investor saving for retirement   very very hard to say   your time might be better spent on your day job if you have one remember because of the fees and added risk involved over say index investing more trading is hazardous to your wealth

yes stock price is determined by the last trade price there are always going to be people who have put in a price to buy a stock called a bid price and people who have put in a price to sell a stock called an ask price based on your example if the last trade price for the stock was $ 1.23 then you might have the following bid prices and ask prices so if you put in a limit order to buy 100 shares at $ 100 you would buy the 40 shares at $ 1.23 the 15 shares at $ and the 45 shares $ 1.25   the price of the stock would go up to $ 1.25 conversely if you put in a limit order to sell 100 shares at $ 0.01 i do n't think any broker would allow a sell price of $ 0.00 you would sell 30 shares at $ 20 shares at $ and 50 shares at $ 1.20   the price of the stock would go down to $ 1.20

no   the wsj prime rate is 4.25 even the fed prime rate is 1.75 way above the 1.20 you 'll be making from your savings account if you are high worth individual with great credit history the bank might give you a personal loan at 4.25 they wo n't care what you do with it as long as they get their payments if you are not that creditworthy they 'll ask for a collateral you can mortgage your house for example it ends up being the thing you get your money and do what you want with it if you can make more than the interest rate the bank gave you great you made profit the bank however wo n't agree to lend you money at 0.6 1/2 of the 1.2 apy your savings account will bring why would they when they can loan that at prime rate of 4.25 the closest you can get to something like this is if you are a hot shot wall street money manager with track record of making big profits in that case the bank might put some money in your fund for you to manage but that 's not something a regular person can do

the dividend tax credit is not applicable to foreign dividend income so you would be taxed fully on every dollar of that income when you sell a stock there will be a capital gain or capital loss depending on if it gained or lost value after accounting for the adjusted cost base you only pay income tax on half of the amount earned through capital gains and if you have losses you can use them to offset other investments that had capital gains or carry forward to offset gains in the future   the dividends from us stocks are subject to a 15 withholding tax that gets paid to the irs automatically when the dividends are issued if the stocks are held in an rrsp they are exempt from the withholding tax if held in a non registered account you can be reimbursed for the tax by claiming the foreign tax credit that you linked to if held in a tfsa or resp the withholding tax can not be recovered also if you are not directly holding the stocks and instead buy a mutual fund or etf that directly holds the stocks then the rrsp exemption no longer applies but the foreign tax credit is still for a non registered account if the mutual fund or etf does not directly hold stocks and instead holds one or more etfs there is no way to recover the withholding tax in any type of account

while c c 's have 0 interest this a good mechanism to manage debt but they expect you will pile up a large debt and at then of the interest free period you will get hammered so plan your exit strategy   plan to pay off the 0 cards at the end of the int free period and pay the other cards down alternatively what you could do is pay off the other cards now by drawing down on the 0 card if its possible your debt is at 0 int also you are consolidating your debt into 1 account when the int free period is over move the debt into a single personal loan if you do n't plan on paying it all off in the meantime put you savings into an interest bearing account to maximize the value of your savings

with a roth ira you can withdraw the contributions at any time without penalty as long as you do n't withdraw the earnings interest there are some circumstances where you can withdraw the earnings such as disability and maybe first home also the roth ira does n't need to go through your employer and i would n't do it through your employer i have mine setup through fidelity though i 'm not sure if they have any guaranteed 3 return unless it was a cd all of mine is in stocks your wife could also setup a roth ira so over 2 years you could contribute $ 20,000 if i was you i would just max out any matches which you surely are at 25 of gross income and then save my down payment money in a normal money market savings account you are doing good contributing almost 25 to the there are also some income limitations on roth iras i believe for a married couple it is $ 160k

the value of an option has 2 components the extrinsic or time value element and the intrinsic value from the difference in the strike price and the underlying asset price with either an american or european option the intrinsic value of a call option can be locked in any time by selling the same amount of the underlying asset whether that be a stock a future etc   further the time value of any option can be by delta hedging the option i.e. buying or selling an amount of the underlying asset weighted by the measure of certainty delta of the option being in the money at expiry instead the extra value of the american option comes from the financial benefit of being able to realise the value of the underlying asset early for a dividend paying stock this will predominantly be the dividend but for non dividend paying stocks or futures the buyer of an in the money option can realise their intrinsic gains on the option early and earn interest on the profits today but what they sacrifice is the of the option   however when an option becomes very in the money and the delta approaches 1 or -1 the discounting of the intrinsic value i.e. the extra amount a future cash flow is worth each day as we draw closer to payment becomes larger than the theta or time value decay of the option then it becomes optimal to early exercise abandon the optionality and realise the monetary gains upfront for a non dividend paying stock the value of the american call option is actually the same as the european the spot price of the stock will be lower than the forward price at expiry discounted by the risk free rate or your cost of funding this will exactly offset the monetary gain by exercising early and banking the proceeds however for an option on a future the value today of the underlying asset the future is the same as at expiry and its possible to fully realise the interest earned on the money received today hence the american call option is worth more for both examples the american put option is worth more slightly more so for the stock as the stock 's spot price is lower than the forward price the owner of the put option a higher intrinsic profit from selling the stock at the higher strike price today than waiting till expiry as well as realising the interest earned liquidity may influence the perceived value of being able to exercise early but its not a tangible factor that is added to the commonly used maths of the option valuation and is n't really a consideration for most of the assets that have tradeable option markets it 's also important to remember at any point in the life of the option you do n't know the future price path you 're only modelling the distribution of probable outcomes what subsequently happens after you early exercise an american option no longer has any bearing on its value this is now zero whether the stock subsequently crashes in price is what is relevant is that when you early exercise a call you give up all potential upside protected by the limit to your downside from the strike price

if you are the only one who puts in a large market buy order then it would definitely push the price up how much up would depend on how many would be willing to sell at what price point it would also be possible that your trade will not get executed as there are no sellers the same would be true if you put in a large sell order with no buyers the price would go down or trade not get executed as there are n't enough buyers

gt;the problem is that the boomers will only start dying when genx starts retiring   ah but the key there is when genx starts retiring meaning when the oldest hit retirement age   the younger will still be in the prime of their life late 40 's and 50 's and so certainly able to own operate the funeral homes amp manufacturing operations etc especially those who finally inherit their silent generation parents assets savings   gt;while your advice made me chuckle it is better directed at millenials   the millenials will certainly have the opportunity to benefit but especially the younger ones yet to reach adulthood will likely be the menial labor of the boomer death boom but as i have said in other places they can probably pretty easily demand high wages for said menial labor because the demand will outweigh the supply thus the accumulated assets of the boomers will one way or another be transferred to genx amp even if it is a bit and     's not limited to the funeral part there 's gon na be big business in things like nursing homes and a high demand and thus high wages for and sponge bath givers etc at least if the boomers want to be respectfully treated by their sponge bath givers they will learn to tip with $ 100 bills for having their crack properly wiped those who do n't or ca n't tip will be left to stew in their own juices so to speak

yes of course there have been studies on this   this is no more than a question about whether the options are properly priced if properly priced then your strategy will not make money on average before transaction costs and will lose once transaction costs are included   if you could make money using your strategy on average then the market should and generally will make an adjustment in the option price to compensate the most famous studies on this were conducted by black and scholes and then by merton this work won the nobel prize in 1995 although the black scholes or black scholes merton equation is so well known now that people may forget it they did n't just sit down one day and write and equation that they thought was cool they actually derived the equation based on market factors beyond this work you 've got at least two branches of study   academics have continued to study option pricing including but not limited to revisions to the original black scholes model and hedge funds large trading house have quants looking at this stuff all of the time   the former you could look up if you want the latter will never see the light of day because it 's proprietary if you want specific references i think that any textbook for a quantitative finance class would be a fine place to start   i would n't be surprised if you actually find your strategy as part of a homework problem this is not to say by the way that i do n't think you can make money with this type of trade but your strategy will need to include more information than you 've outlined here   choosing which information and getting your hands on it in a timely manner will be the key

i 'm not sure about your first two options   but given your situation a variant of option three seems possible    that way you do n't have to throw away your appraisal although it 's possible that you 'll need to get some kind of addendum related to the repairs    you also do n't have your liquid money tied up long term   you just need to float it for a month or two while the repairs are being done   the bank should be able to you for the loan    note that you might be better off without the loan   you 'll have to pay interest on the loan and there 's extra red tape    i 'd just prefer not to tie up so much money in this property    i do n't understand this   with a loan you are even more tied up   anything you do you have to work with the bank   sure you have $ 80k more cash available with the loan but it does n't sound like you need it   with the loan the bank makes the profit   if you buy in cash you lose your interest from the cash but you save paying the interest on the loan   in general the interest rate on the loan will be higher than the return on the cash equivalent    a fourth option would be to pay the $ 15k up front as earnest money   the seller does the repairs through your chosen contractor   you pay the remaining $ 12.5k for the downpayment and buy the house with the loan   this is a more complicated purchase contract though so cash might be a better option    you can easily evaluate the difficulty of the second option   call a different bank and ask   if you explain the situation they 'll let you know if they can use the existing appraisal or not   also consider asking the appraiser if there are specific banks that will accept the appraisal   that might be quicker than randomly choosing banks    it may be that your current bank just is n't used to investment properties   requiring the previous owner to do repairs prior to sale is very common in residential properties   it sounds like the loan officer is trying to use the rules for residential for your investment purchase   a different bank may be more inclined to work with you for your actual purchase

you go public to raise money to invest in the business and/or pay off the existing shareholders it 's really as simple as that the advantage of being public is that your shares can easily be bought and sold and so you can issue and sell new ones and your existing shareholders can sell out if they want to the disadvantage is that you are much more tightly regulated with more disclosure requirements and also that you are exposed to much more pressure from your shareholders to maintain and increase your share price

there are at least a couple of ways you could view this to my mind make an excel spreadsheet and use the irr function to compute the rate of return you are having based on money being added re invested distributions in a mutual fund are n't really an additional investment as the net asset value of the fund will drop by the amount of the distribution aside from market fluctuation this is presuming you want a raw percentage that could be tricky to compare to other funds without doing more than a bit of work in a way look at what is the fund 's returns compared to both the category and the index it is tracking the tracking error is likely worth noting as some index funds could lag the index by a sizable margin and thus may not be that great at the same time there may exist cases where an index fund is n't quite measuring up that well the small growth indexing anomaly would be the william bernstein article from 2001 that has some facts and figures for this that may be useful

i think you are making this more complicated that it has to be   in the end you will end up with a car that you paid x and is worth y. your numbers are a bit hard to follow   hopefully i got this right i am no accountant this is how i would figure the deal the payments made are irrelevant   the downpayment is irrelevant as it is still a reduction in net worth    your current car has a asset value of <   that should make anyone pause a bit    in order to get into this new car you will have to finance the shortfall on the current car the price of the vehicle the immediate depreciation say 7,000   in the end you will have a car worth 38 k and owe   so you will have a asset value of <   obviously a much worse situation   to do this car deal it would cost the person of net worth the day the deal was done   as time on it would be more as the reduction in debt is unlikely to keep up with the depreciation additionally the new car purchase screen shows a payment of $ if you bought the car with zero down   except you do n't have zero down you have down   making the car payment higher i with months   so rather than having a hit to your cash flow of $ for 69 more months you would have a payment of about $ 1000 for 84 months if you could obtain the interest rate of 3.5 those are the two things i would focus on is the reduction in net worth and the cash flow liability    i understand you are trying to get a feel for things but there are two things that make this very unrealistic   the first is financing   it is unlikely that financing could be obtained with this deal and if it could this would be considered a sub prime loan   however perhaps a relative could finance the deal secondly there is no way even a moderately financially responsible spouse would approve this deal   that is provided there were not assets like a few million if that is the case why not just write a check

it may seem very simple on its face but you do n't know the merchant 's agreement   you do n't know who is providing the processing equipment   you do n't know a lot of things   you know that visa mastercard discover amex and others have network requirements and agreements   you know that laws have been changed to allow merchant surcharges previously it was contracts that prohibited surcharges not laws    that gas station or that pizza or any other merchant does n't have a direct relationship with visa or mastercard it has an agreement with a bank or other processing entity   the issue here is whom do you even call   and what would you gain   find out what bank is contracted for that particular equipment and file a complaint that the merchant charged you $ 0.35   maybe the merchant agreement allows surcharges up to state and local maximums   you do n't know the terms of their agreement   calling around to figure out what parties are involved to understand the terms of their agreement is a waste of time like you said you can just go across the street if it 's so offensive to you   or just carry a little cash    if that 's not the answer you 're looking for here 's one for you there is no practical recourse

agreed a philosophy of and provoking trade wars with former trade allies is the preferred approach for the trump administration however closing borders to imports is likely to have a very high offsetting cost for us exports    it all seems very shortsighted just based on what canada and the uk are likely to do in response to just this decision alone will certainly cost companies like boeing and lockheed martin a lot more in exports than they will ever gain through this maneuver

i visited annualcreditreport.com to get my annual credit report   it is only the report not the score or fico score   this is the only outlet i know of that allows you to get your report for free without a bunch of strings attached or crap to sign up for and cancel later it was very easy   i was wary of putting in my private information but how else can they possibly pull you up read the instructions carefully   you go to each bureau to fetch your report and they give you a free report but they push hard to try and sell you a score or a report service   it is easy to avoid these if you read carefully once you get a report   you have print it out or you ca n't see it again for another year   each bureau has a different site with different rules and different identity checks to get in   again read the instructions and it is n't hard instead of printing i just saved the page as html   you get one html file and a folder with all the images and other stuff   this suits me but you might like to print after you get each report you have to click a link to back to the annualcreditreport.com site   from there you go to the next bureau regarding a score   everybody does it differently   free does fico but anybody who pulls your credit can generate a score however they like so getting a score is n't anywhere near as important as making sure your report is accurate you can use to simulate a score from one of the bureaus i ca n't easily see which one at the moment   it is as easy as annualcreditreport.com and i have no issue getting a simulated score and report card

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

pool their money into my own brokerage account and simply split the gains losses proportional to the amount of money that we 've each    contributed to the account i 'm wary of this approach due to the tax    implications and perhaps other legal issues so i 'd appreciate    community insight here you 're right to be wary you might run into gift tax issues as well as income tax liability and of earnings not a good idea at all do n't do this have them set up their own brokerage account and have them give me the    login credentials and i manage the investments for them this is    obviously the best approach from a tracking and tax perspective but    harder for me to manage to be honest i 'm already spending more time    than i want to managing my own investments so option 1 really appeals    to me if the drawbacks are n't prohibitive that would also require you to be a licensed financial adviser at least to the best of my understanding otherwise there 's a lot of issues with potential liability if you make investments that lose money you might be required to repay the losses you should do this only with a proper legal and tax advice from an attorney and/or cpa ea licensed in your state there are proper ways to do this limited partnership or llc for example but you have to cover your ass with proper operating agreements in place that have to be reviewed by legal counsel of each of the members partners

currency hedge means that you are somewhat protected from movements in currency as your investment is in gold not currency so this then becomes less speculative and concentrates more on your intended investment   edit the purpose of the etf is aimed for investors living in europe wanting to invest in usd gold and not be effected by movements in the eur usd the etf aims to hedge against the effects of the currency movements in the eur usd and more closely track the usd gold price the 3 charts below demonstrate this over the past 5 years     so as is demonstrated the performance of the etf closely matches the performance of the usd gold price rather than the eur gold price meaning someone in europe can invest in the fund and get the appropriate similar performance as investing directly into the usd gold without being affected by currency exchange when changing back to eur this is by no way speculative as the op suggests but is in fact serving the purpose as per the etf details

since no one else answered this part of your question yet   checking your own credit score or report will not affect it in any way   it only hurts you when someone looks it up to run a credit check at your request for the purpose of possibly getting a loan for example a car dealership this only hurts it a tiny bit and is not worth worrying about unless you are going to 20 different car dealerships who each do a check however it is a good idea not to let them run your credit until you are seriously ready to buy a car in fact it is better to just get financing somewhere else and not let them run it at all

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt

why are banks all of a sudden providing people their credit scores for free because it is a really good idea    on an abc bank website it has   check your credit score for free button   you click it   not only will it come up with a credit score but it could also trigger a marketing workflow   if it is direct mail email or a phone call a banker could contact you for help with a debt product   this marketing could also be targeted say a person with a high score could be targeted for a mortgage   a person with a low or medium score could be targeted for ways and products to improve their score now if you run xyz bank and not do the same you are losing a competitive advantage to banks that offer this   not only will your customers be less happy but you will lose a great marketing opportunities    face it the only people that worry about their credit score are people that are in the market to borrow   which again is more information   if you have someone that never checks their credit score or has their credit frozen then it is wise not to market to them debt products

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

first you mentioned your brother in law has $ 100,000 in stock options fully vested do you mean his exercise cost would be $ 100,000 i.e. what he 'd need to pay to buy the shares if so then what might be the estimated value of the shares acquired options having vested does n't necessarily mean they possess value merely that they may be exercised or did you mean the estimated intrinsic value of those options estimated value less exercise cost is $ 100,000 speaking from my own experience i 'd like to address just the first part of your question have you treated this as you would a serious investment in any other company that is have you or your brother in law reviewed the company 's financial statements for the last few years other than hearing from people with a vested interest quite literally to pump up the stock with talk around the office how do you know the company is btw as an option holder only your brother in law 's rights to financial information may be limited will the company share these details anyway or if he exercised at least one option to become a bona fide shareholder i believe he 'd have rights to request the financial statements but company bylaws vary and different jurisdictions say different things about what can be restricted beyond the financial statements here are some more things to consider the worst case risk you 'd need to accept is zero liquidity and complete loss if there 's no eventual buy out or ipo the shares may effectively be worthless even if there is a private market willing buyers may quickly dry up if company fortunes decline contrast this to public stock markets where there 's usually an opportunity to witness deterioration exit at a loss and preserve some capital of course with great risk may come great reward do your own due diligence and convince yourself through a rigorous analysis not hopes dreams that the investment might be worth the risk

i 'll assume that you would work as a regular part time employee in this case you are technically a you will need a specific kind of swiss permit allowing you to work in switzerland your employer typically takes care of this they have more experience than you you being non eu might make matters a bit more complicated your employer will withhold 4.5 of your gross income as source taxes when you do your tax declaration your entire income will be taxed in germany since this is where you live this will happen after your first year of work be prepared for a large tax bill or think of this as an interest free loan from germany to you however due to the dba the 4.5 you already paid to switzerland will be deducted from the taxes you are due in germany judging from my experience the tax authorities in germany are not fluent in the dba particularly in areas far away from the swiss border i had to gently remind them to deduct the source taxes explicitly referring to the dba the bill was revised without problems but i strongly recommend making sure that your source taxes are correctly deducted from your german tax liability once your local german tax office understands your situation you will be asked to make quarterly prepayments which will be calculated in a way to minimize your later overall tax liability budget for these you did n't ask but i 'll tell you anyway social security will normally be handled by switzerland as the country of employment not the country of residence your employer will automatically deduct old age unemployment and accident insurance and contribute to a pension plan all in switzerland however if you do a lot of your work in germany > 25 which certainly applies if you plan on mostly working remotely your social security will be handled by your country of residence this is a major pain for your employer because now your swiss employer needs to understand the german social security system how much and to whom to co pay and so forth this is a major area of study and your employer may not want to spend all this effort my employer has looked at this and requires anyone living outside of switzerland to limit working from home to less than 25 because by extension they would some day also need to do the same for employees living in france italy austria or even the uk they do n't want to dig through half the eu states social security regulations therefore you would not be able to work remotely from germany for my employer this is actually a fairly recent development that only entered in force at the beginning of 2015 before that this was all a bit of a gray area your prospective employer may not be aware of all details so you will need to think about whether you actively want to point them at this possibly ruining your plans of working remotely or not and possibly getting major problems and post payments years later finally i think you can choose whether you want to have your health insurance in switzerland or in germany unless your swiss obligation to be insured is waived because of your part time status some swiss health insurers offer plans where they cooperate with german health insurers so you can go to german doctors just like a german resident source i have been a from germany into switzerland off and on for over ten years now i ca n't say anything about whether your german visa restricts you from working in switzerland you may want to ask about this at se but i 'd much rather ask your local german authorities than random strangers on the internet

i used to sell electronics at sears   let me tell you something about the sears i worked at   at the time sears could not figure out how to keep track of how many tvs we had   so whenever a customer wanted a tv we had to dash across the store go into the backroom get a manager to open the tv cage and physically check if we had the tv in stock     this was a colossal waste of time and we never really had more than 2 or 3 of any given tv at a time   i lost sales all the time because we did n't have tvs in stock   turns out people do n't want to wait a week to pick up a tv they bought   my coworkers and i complained to our manager about this but nothing was ever done

i do n't like to use the word racist because as you have pointed out it is has been in discourse   it would have been better for me to write about racism rather than actually use the word racist in my last post   i try to keep my posts about ideas and not people and i messed up   i have no basis to call you a racist i do n't know you   nor will i assume any malice on your part or on the part of those who disagree with me   all i am stating is that there appears to be no reason to think that races are biologically important and article race is a social construct scientists   i bring up as an example because if you go looking you may find that some groups statistically share traits   but it does n't mean anything because correlation does n't prove causation   i also use this analogy because is seen as something of a benign belief and that 's all i want to get across here that people often adopt the beliefs of their society   like the widespread belief in god i find the widespread belief in race to be misplaced

there actually would n't be a need to increase prices in order to provide wal mart employees with a living wage though there is another way cut executive pay   in fact i 'd like to see a law on the books that makes maximum executive pay including bonuses and stock a certain percentage or multiple of the pay of the lowest paid employee before you can raise the pay of an executive beyond a certain point the pay of all the employees simply has to go up this would give executives another incentive to raise the pay of their employees since their ability to get a raise would depend on it i 'm thinking something along the lines of executive pay being capped at 100x the pay of the lowest paid employee your employees make $ 20,000 a year your executives make no more than $ 2,000,000 a year want that to go up guess it 's time for raises then   the main point of such a law would be to make sure that employees are paid for the benefits they bring in to the company along with having a living wage as it stands employees might get a 25 cent hour raise a year in low wage jobs if they get anything at all this way if there 's enough money to go around to the people at the top the people at the bottom also see some of that money

my answer is with respect to the united states i have no idea about india 's regulatory environment you are opening yourself up to massive liabilities and problems if you deposit their money in your account i managed investment accounts as a private investment advisor for years those with less than 15 clients were not required to register until dodd frank changed the rules thus you would have to register as an advisor probably needing to take the series 65 exam or qualifying some other way e.g. getting your cfp cfa etc i used a discount broker dealer scottrade as the custodian here 's how it works each client 's account was their own account and i had a master account that allowed me to bill their accounts and manage them   they signed paperwork making me the advisor on their account   i had very little accounting to handle aside from tracking basis for taxed accounts if you take custody of the money you 'll have regulatory obligations there are always lots of stories in the financial advisor trade publications about advisors who go to jail for screwing their clients the most common factor they took custody of the assets i understand why you want a single account you want to ensure that each client gets the same results right does each client want the same results   certainly the tax situation for each is different yes   perhaps one has gains and wants to take losses in one year and the other does n't if their accounts are managed separately one can take losses while the other realizes gains to offset other losses financial advisors offer these kinds of accounts as separately managed accounts the advisors on these kinds of accounts are mutual funds managers and they try to match a target portfolio but they can do things like realize gains or losses for clients if their tax situation would prefer it you certainly ca n't let them put retirement accounts into your single account unless the irs has you on their list of acceptable custodians i suggest that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with the regulatory environment that you want to operate under then after examining the pros and cons you should decide which route you want to take   i think the most direct and feasible route is to pass the series 65 register as an investment advisor and find a custodian who will let you manage the assets as the advisor on the account real estate is another matter you should talk to an attorney not some random guy on the internet even if he has an mba and a bs in real estate which i do this is very much a state law thing

the answer is discounted cash flows companies that do n't pay dividends are ostensibly reinvesting their cash at returns higher than shareholders could obtain elsewhere   they are reinvesting in productive capacity with the aim of using this greater productive capacity to generate even more cash in the future this is n't just true for companies but for almost any cash generating project with a project you can purchase some type of productive assets you may perform some kind of transformation on the good or not with the intent of selling a product service or in fact the productive mechanism you have built this productive mechanism is typically called a company what is the value of such a productive mechanism yes it 's capacity to continue producing cash into the future under literally any scenario discounted cash flow is how cash flows at distinct intervals are valued   a company that does not pay dividends now is capable of paying them in the future   berkshire hathaway   does not pay a dividend currently but it 's cash flows have been reinvested over the years such that it 's current cash paying capacity has multiplied many thousands of times over the decades this is why companies that have never paid dividends trade at higher prices microsoft did not pay dividends for many years because the cash was better used developing the company to pay cash flows to investors in later years a companies value is the sum of it 's risk adjusted cash flows in the future even when it has never paid shareholders a dime if you had a piece of paper that obligated an entity such as the government to absolutely pay you $ 1,000 20 years from now this $ 1,000 cash flows present value could be estimated using discounted cash flow it might be around $ 400 for example   but let 's say you want to trade this promise to pay before the 20 years is up   would it be worth anything   of course it would   it would in fact typically go up in value barring heavy inflation until it was worth very close to $ 1,000 moments before it 's value is redeemed imagine that this promise to pay is much like a non dividend paying stock   throughout its life it has never paid anyone anything but over the years it 's value goes up   it is because the discounted cash flow of the $ 1,000 payout can be estimated at almost anytime prior to it 's payout

i 've had a mortgage changing hands with mid size companies for many years with no problems   i 've handled many complex financial and technical transactions with multiple parties with no problems over the course decades then after my last refinance my mortgage fell into the hands of jp morgan chase the bank sent one letter to let me know of the transfer and in the next week they sent my loan to collections for what i later found to be chase 's process error in the transfer    for the next three months i ended up in customer service hell as one chase group threatened to foreclose on my house while another group told me to ignore the imminent foreclosure notices one started to investigate the transfer while the collections group tried to make me pay my mortgage payment twice   the mess only ended up being taken care of after i tracked down the old owner of my loan and had them refund the lost payment directly to me normally they would have sent it to the company buying the loan but could not get chase to accept the payment then i paid chase that exact same mortgage payment     all the time the chase internal investigations and collections department were completely incapable of a simple call to previous holder of the loan a company handling millions of mortgage transactions is somehow incapable of handling a minor glitch in a mortgage transfer it 's either utter incompetence or total malice in picking up extra penalty fees or maybe an occasional if homeowners did n't say on top of the details this is what we used our collective tax dollars to bail out

in the absence of a country designation where the mutual fund is registered the question can not be fully answered   for us mutual funds the per share is calculated each day after the close of the stock exchanges and all purchase and redemption requests received that day are transacted at this share price so the price of the mutual fund shares for april 2016 is not enough information you need to specify the date more accurately your calculation of what you get from the mutual fund is incorrect because in the us declared mutual fund dividends are net of the expense ratio if the declared dividend is us$ per share you get a cash payout of us$ for each share that you own the expense ratio has already been subtracted before the declared dividend is calculated   the price of the mutual fund also falls by the amount of the per share dividend assuming that the price of all the fund assets e.g. shares of stocks bonds etc does not change that day thus if you have opted to re invest your dividend in the same fund your holding has the same value as before but you own more shares of the mutual fund which have a lower price per share for exchange traded funds the rules are slightly different in other jurisdictions the rules might be different too

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

what most people who dislike globalization do n't realize is that by letting companies do what is best to distribute their companies across the globe based on least cost to them it actually the economies in the long run and eventually causes jobs to return to us as costs rise along with standard of living in foreign countries as long as the usa competes well against other countries especially on taxes to do business to attract business to the usa there should be no long term fear of companies keeping jobs overseas

eventually you are going to need some sort of real credit history   it is possible that you will be able to evade this if you never buy a house or if you pay cash for any house condo car boat etc that you buy   even employers check credit history these days   i would n't be surprised if some medical professionals such as surgeons check it also   obviously if you have a mortgage and car loan this does n't apply but i 'd be curious how you acquired those unless you have substantial income and/or assets combine this with the fact that certain things like renting a car essentially require a credit card because they need to put a hold on more money than they are actually going to take out of your card so they can take that money if you do n't bring the car back and i think you should have a credit card unless you and your wife are individuals with zero impulse control which sounds highly improbable if your concern is the financial liability of the credit line just keep the credit line low

probably not though there are a few things to be said for understanding what you are doing here   primerica acts as an independent financial services firm and thus has various partners that specialize in various financial instruments and thus there may exist other firms that primerica does n't use that could offer better products   now how much do you want to value your time as it could take more than a few months to go through every possible insurance firm and broker to see what rate you could get for the specific insurance you want   there is also the question of what constitutes best here   is it paying the minimal premiums before getting a payout   that would be my interpretation though this requires some amazing guesswork to know when to start paying a policy to pay out so quickly that the insurance company takes a major loss on the policy similarly there are thousands of mutual funds out there and it is incredibly difficult to determine which ones would be best for your situation   how much risk do you want to take   how often do you plan to add to it   what kind of accounts are you using for these investments e.g. iras or just regular taxable accounts   do tax implications of the investments matter thus i 'd likely want to suggest you consider this question how much trust do you have that this company will work well for you in handling the duty of managing your investments and insurance needs   if you trust them then buy what they suggest   if you do n't then buy somewhere else but be careful about what kind of price are you prepared to pay to find the mythical best as those usually only become clear in hindsight when it comes to trusting a company in case there are more than a few factors i 'd likely use questions how well do they answer your questions or concerns from your perspective   do you feel that these are being treated with respect or do you get the feeling they want to say what the heck are you thinking for asking that in a kind of perspective structure of meeting do you like to have an agenda and things all planned out or are you more of the we 'll figure it out kind of person   this is about how well do they know you and set things up to suit you well tone of talk do you feel valued in having these conversations and working through various exercises with the representative   this is kind of like 1 though it would include requests they have for you employee turnover how long has this person been with primerica   do they generally lose people frequently   are you ok with your file being passed around like a hot potato   not that it necessarily will but just consider the possibility here reputation can be a factor though i 'd not really use it much as some people can find those bad apples that are n't there anymore and so it is n't an issue now   in some ways you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you   there are more than a few companies that want to get a piece of what you 'll invest buy and use when it comes to financial products so it may be a good idea to shop around a little

hope springs eternal in the human breast no actively managed fund has beaten the indices over a long period of time but over shorter periods actively managed funds have beaten the indices quite often sometimes quite spectacularly and sometimes even for many years in a row examples from the past include fidelity and mason value trust so people buy actively managed funds hoping to cash in on such   good performance the difficulty is of course that many people do n't even think about investing in a fund until it is listed in some top forty funds of last year compilation and for many funds they have already peaked and new buyers are often disappointed   some   people who invested earlier plan on getting out of the fund before   the fund falls flat on its face and fewer even succeed in doing so as to why 401k plans often have high cost actively managed funds there are several reasons a most important one is that there are numerous companies that act as administrators of 401k programs and these companies put together package deals of 401k programs funds administrative costs etc and small employers have to choose from one of these packages   second there are various rules that have come into existence since the first days of 401k and 403b programs such as the investment choices must include funds of different types and actively managed funds large cap small cap etc are one of the choices that must be offered gone are the days when the only choice was a variable annuity offered by the insurance company administering the 401k program finally program participants also have hopes cf opening sentence and used to demand that the 401k program offer a few actively managed funds not just index funds

as others have stated the current price is simply the last price at which the security traded for any given tick however there are many bid ask prices because securities can trade on multiple exchanges and between many agents on a single exchange this is true for both types of exchanges that chris mentioned in his answer chris answer is pretty thorough in explaining how the two types of exchanges work so i 'll just add some minor details in exchanges like nasdaq there are multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities which theoretically introduces competition between them and therefore lowers the bid ask spreads that traders face although this results in the market makers earning less compensation for their risk they hope to make up the difference by making the market for highly liquid securities this could also result in your order filling in pieces at several different prices if your brokerage firm fills it through multiple market makers of course if you place your order on an exchange where an electronic system fills it the other type of exchange that chris mentioned this could happen anyway   in short if you place a market order for 1000 shares it could be filled at several different prices depending on volume multiple bid ask prices etc if you place a sizable order your broker may fill it in pieces regardless to prevent you from moving the market this is rarely a problem for small time investors trading securities with high volumes but for investors with higher capital like institutional investors mutual funds etc who place large orders relative to the average volume this could conceivably be a burden both in the price difference across time as the order is placed and the increased bookkeeping it demands   this is tangentially related so i 'll add it anyway in cases like the one described above all or none orders are one solution these are orders that instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction most brokers offer these but there are some caveats that apply to them specifically i have n't been able to find some of this information so some of this is from memory   all or none orders are only an option if the order is for more than a certain numbers of shares i think the minimum size is 300 or 400 shares   your order wo n't be placed until your broker places all other orders ahead of it that do n't have special conditions attached to them   i believe all or none orders are day orders which means that if there was n't enough supply to fill the order during the day the order is cancelled at market close   orders only apply to limit orders if you want to replicate the behavior of a market order with characteristics you can try setting a limit buy sell order a few cents above below the current market price

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

there is no unique identifier that exists to identify specific shares of a stock just like money in the bank there is no real reason to identify which exact dollar bills belong to me or you so long as there is a record that i own x bills and i can access them when i want of course unlike banks there is still a 1:1 relationship between the amount i should own and the amount they actually hold if i may reach a bit the question that i assume you are asking is how are shared actually tracked transferred and recorded so that i know for certain that i traded you 20 microsoft shares yesterday and they are now officially yours given that it 's all digital while you can technically try and request a physical share certificate it 's very cumbersome to handle and transfer in that form   ownership of shares themselves are tracked for brokerage firms in the case of retail trading which i assume is the context of this question as we 're discussion personal finance your broker has a record of how many shares of x y and z you own when you bought each share and for how much and while you are the beneficial owner of record you get dividends voting rights etc your brokerage is the one who is holding the shares when you buy or sell a stock and you are matched with a counterparty the process of which is beyond the scope of this question then a process of settlement comes into play in the us settlement takes 3 working days to process and technically ownership does not transfer until the 3rd day after the trade is made though things like margin accounts will allow you to effectively act as if you own the shares immediately after a buy sell order is filled settlement in the us is done by a sole source the depository trust clearing corporation this is where retail and institutional trade all go to be sorted checked and confirmed and ultimately returned to the safekeeping of their new owners representatives your brokerage interestingly the is also the central custodian for shares both physical and virtual and that is where the shares of stock ultimately reside

no   this is too much for most individuals even some small to medium businesses   when you sell that investment and take the cheque into the foreign bank and wire it back to the usa in us dollars you will definitely obtain the final value of the investment converted to us$ that s what you wanted right   you 'll get that   if you also hedge unless you have a situation where it is a perfect hedge then you are gambling on what the currencies will do a perfect hedge is unusual for what most individuals are involved in it looks something like this   you know is going to pay you 10 million on dec 31   so you go to a bank probably a foreign bank i 've found they have lower limits for this kind of transaction and more customizable than what you might create trading futures contracts and tell them i have this contract for a 10 million receivable on dec 31 i 'd like to arrange a fx forward contract and lock in a rate for this in us$   they may have a credit check or a deposit for such an arrangement because as the rates change either the bank will owe you money or you will owe the bank money if they quote you 0.05 us$ then you know that when you hand the cheque over to the bank your contract payment will be worth us$ 500,000   the forward rate may differ from the current rate that s how the bank accounts for risk and includes a profit even with a perfect hedge you should be able to see the potential for trouble   if the bank does nt quite trust you and hey banks are nt known for trust then as the strengthens relative to the us$ they may suspect that you will walk away from the deal   this risk can be reduced by including terms in the contract requiring you to pay the bank some as that happens   if the falls you would get this money credited back to your account   this is also how futures contracts work there it is called mark to market accounting   trouble here   some people seeing how they are down money on the hedge cancel it   it is a classic mistake because it the protection that one was trying to achieve   often the rate will move back and the is left with less money than they would have had doing nothing even though they bought a perfect hedge

no rep from amazon has ever my ego so i do n’t know what you mean    and as far as reps go people who help you with products beyond paint and decor rarely understand what they are selling hence the 1 guy they all depend on vs the staff at a home store in japan who all work in areas they know    so what are you buying tractors or some shit full of a c    if you are buying enough to save hundreds of dollars at a time i assume you are a contractor and you a should already know your shit so reps are just there to prepare paperwork and b missing the point of what i am saying    if i call a parts supply warehouse and ask them for a core i ’m not going to ask them what model it goes in or how to install it the rep ’s competence could easily be replaced by amazon    if i have a broken mac i want to go to a store where they know how to fix it and give me advice and in that manner home depot often falls flat    so they will eventually get their hat handed to them because eventually amazon will beat them in distribution and they wo n’t have the volume to warrant a chain of stores to draw foot traffic

from wikipedia in finance a high yield bond non investment grade bond speculative grade bond or junk bond is a bond that is rated below investment grade at the time of purchase these bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events but typically pay higher yields than better quality bonds in order to make them attractive to investors in terms of your second question you have the causality backwards   they are called junk bonds because they have a higher risk of default

gt no one when car replaced horse carriage   your broad point definitely stands but this statement is not correct   a ton of people when the horse carriage started dying cow leather farmers sanitation workers that raised amp bred horses those industries were gigantic at the time and all took a huge hit   and it definitely sucked for them they did n't do anything wrong but their means of livelihood were eroded and practically destroyed and not for depleting a resource of some kind like maybe a mine running dry   but the relevant question is what happened to the value of their product and is anyone at fault   the answer is that it 's pretty simply no one and you just have to chalk it up to times change

c'mon bill you 're better than this   aside from the fact that he accumulated his personal wealth through ruthless profiteering and tax shelters it 's just a flat out bad idea   it was an even worse idea when some actor and commie started pushing it   all this tax will do is hamper the ability to do business i.e. market liquidity and end up being by small banks and in the end the consumer   big banks will find their ways around this no problem but the boutique capital firms will surely struggle     this is n't just a oh we 'll institute this micro tax and everyone is happy they want to tax the underlying value of assets on each trade   this creates a direct impact to free market trading which i do n't believe they 've accounted for which is shocking really   it 's a tax on the top and and a general tax on the actual execution point of an entire industry   it 's a half baked idea that should n't have gotten as far as it did

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

gt;are you saying they did commit fraud but it 's hard too pin on any one person you say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it 's too hard to prove there was fraud so what did they do if it was n't fraud   i am saying both i am saying that as a general matter criminal fraud is difficult to prove and expensive to litigate fraud requires intent you have to know or reasonably know that what you are doing is fraudulent and you do it anyway proving that mens rea is extremely difficult in this situation risky does not mean fraudulent the entire market was bundling mortgage backed securities fannie mae and freddie mac government backed entities were the largest buyers of mbs   the point is that if the banks honestly believed that they mbs were secure and the regulators at the time did not see a problem with them then how can you prove criminal fraud we are only displaying hindsight bias because the subprime market did indeed implode and it did affect the wider mortgage market and the economy but it was n't known that would happen at the time no financial models projected that everything would fail   you can blame lack of foresight or whatever but risky losses is not criminal corporations are allowed the business judgment rule which is arguably the strongest presumption in all of law there were bad models but they were n't fraudulent    now there could have been fraud in certain circumstances but in no way was it systematic it was bad modeling and bad economics   again bernanke has multiple bernanke saying there was no problem how can the bank 's actions be fraudulent when the top regulator is saying nothing is wrong and the market is working as intended

total income mandatory spending ie bills = discretionary income   make a budget and calculate how much discretionary income you have each pay period save some fraction of your discretionary income towards this purchase pull the trigger when you have enough saved   by thinking this way you ensure that the ps is robbing from movies dining out booze etc instead of taking from rent money or the electric bill do not use debt to make this purchase it would be wise to put off this purchase until you have a solid emergency cash reserve that can sustain you if life throws you a curve ball you should also make sure to eliminate any bad debt like credit card debt before splurging on a new gaming console

okay let 's try this a different way completely forget about what the bond is with here is how a bond works    you get paid interest for holding the bond 5 interest means a coupon of $ 50 assuming one coupon a year     at the end of the bond term maturity you get paid $ 1000      in your scenario you get paid the $ 50 as an interest payment and the $ 1000 final payment     if you only had the bond for one year your total payment will be $ 1050      try drawing a timeline to it a bit better

i get it money is money and shareholders demand businesses make as much as they possibly can great that does n't change my opinion that tax inversions are wrong they deprive the us of valuable income which has been earned through infrastructure defense education etc it 's legal right now so fine but i do n't have to patronize businesses which choose to do this so if the deal closes as much as i do n't eat fast food often burger king will lose my future business just my choice and my choice to make the suggestion to others in as many public forums as possible

to avoid i state up front that this answer is applicable to the us europeans asians canadians etc may well have quite different systems and rules you have nothing to worry about if you pay off your credit card statement   in full on the day it is due in timely fashion on the other hand if you routinely carry a balance from month to month or have taken out cash advances then making whatever payment you want to make that month asap will save you more in finance charges than you could ever earn on the money in your savings account but if you pay off each month 's balance in full then read the fine print about when the payment is due very carefully it might say that payments received before 5 pm will be posted the same day or it might say before 3 pm or before 7 pm est or noon pst etc etc etc as joetaxpayer says if you can pay on line with a guaranteed day for the transaction and you do it before any deadline imposed by the credit card company you are fine   my bank allows me to write electronic checks on its website but a paper check is mailed to the credit card company the bank claims that if i specify the due date they will mail the check enough in advance that the credit card company will get it by the due date but do you really trust the usps to deliver your check by noon or whatever besides the bank will put a hold on that money the day that check is cut i have n't bothered to check if the money being held still earns interest or not   in any case the bank all responsibility for the after effects late payment fees finance charges on all purchases etc if that paper check is not received on time and so your credit card account goes to late payment status   oh and my bank also wants a monthly fee for its billpay service any number   of such electronic checks allowed each month the billpay service does include payment electronically to local merchants and utilities that have accounts at the bank and have signed up to receive payments electronically all my credit card companies allow me to use their website to authorize them to collect the payment that i specify from my bank account(s i can choose the day the amount and which of my bank accounts they will collect the money from but i must do this every month very conveniently they show a calendar for choosing the date with the due date marked prominently and as mhoran_psprep 's comment points out the payment can be scheduled well in advance of the date that the payment will actually be made that is i do n't need to worry about being without internet access because of travel and thus being unable to login to the credit card website to make the payment on   the date it is due i can also sign up for autopay which takes amount minimum payment due payment in full whatever i choose   on the date due and this will happen month after month after month   with no further action necessary on my part   with either choice   it is up to the card company to collect money from my account on the day specified and if they mess up they can not charge late payment fees or finance charge on new purchases etc   also unlike   my bank there are no fees for this service it is also worth noting that many people do not like the idea of the credit card company withdrawing money from their bank account and so this option is not to everyone 's taste

story this is how much money exists in the entire world in one 12 18 and explanation   the broadest interpretation is that there are of dollars in various markets   bill gates could become a so even his wealth is a drop the ocean well not really but you get the idea   a lot of this money is constantly on the move it is impossible to track down all the movements value is increasing value is destroyed etc   your bank account can be but it 's impossible to track down the money of the world a continent or even a small country even bigger companies have trouble tracking down their money   the idea of the tally is a bit of an outdated one it came from a time when there was a gold standard and when old fashioned marxism   was still a thing   words english difficult

i heard that a c corp being a one person shop no other employees but the owner can pay for the full amount 100 of personal rent if the residence is being used as a home office sure especially if you do n't mind being audited technically it does n't matter how the money gets where it goes as long as the income tax filings accurately describe the tax situation but the irs hates it when you make personal expenses from a business account even if you 've paid the required personal income tax because their computers simply are n't smart enough to keep up with that level of chaos also on a non tax level commingling of business and personal funds can reduce the effectiveness of your company 's liability protection and you could more easily become personally liable if the company goes bankrupt from what i understand the 30 would be the expense and the 70 profit distribution i recommend you just pay yourself and pay the rent from your personal account and claim the allowed deductions properly like everyone else why when it would make sense to do this are there any tax benefits never because no you would still have to pay personal income tax on your 70 share of the rent the 30 you may be able to get deductions for but the rules are quite complicated and you should never just estimate the only way to get money out of a corporation without paying personal income tax is by having a qualified dividend that 's quite complicated your accounting has to be clear that the money being issued as a qualified dividend came from an economic profit not from a paper profit resulting from the fact that you worked hard without paying yourself market value

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

this answer is based on australian tax which is significantly different i only offer it in case others want to compare situations in australia a popular tax reduction technique is negative gearing borrow from a bank buy an investment property if the income the new property is not enough to cover interest payments plus maintenance etc then the excess each year is a capital loss which you claim each year as an offset to your income ie pay less tax by the time you reach retirement the idea is to have paid off the mortgage you then live off the revenue stream in retirement or sell the property for a taxed lump sum
