upstream is into businesses that supply the original business downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product   so in that description what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing this is also called vertical integration   meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it   this is in contrast with horizontal integration where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate    in general the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers and intermediate consumers and has more control over its supply chain   the downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain as they compete with them   some companies are better at managing to do both   for example amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales   but partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales choosing how much to send out to amazon    if you are investing in individual stocks integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas   so they can be harder to balance with other stocks   you can either buy plantations transport and manufacturing together or not buy at all   if your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company   of course everyone else has the same problem which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued   so they may be an opportunity as a value stock

ditto bill and i upvoted his answer but let me add a bit if everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit or more precisely integral of risk times potential profit if company a was 100 guaranteed to make $ 1 million profit this year while company b had 50 change to make a $ 2 million profit and 50 to make $ 0 and every investor in the world knew that then i 'd expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value the catch to that though is that no one really knows the risk the risk is n't like we 're going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes $ 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes $ 0 so we could calculate the exact probability the risk comes from lack of information will consumers want to buy this new product how many what are they willing to pay how capable is the new ceo etc it 's very hard to calculate probabilities on these things how can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur so in real life prices are the risk reward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear but that 's about the most one can say

this may sound very tongue in cheek but the best thing you can invest in is to raise your income in order to increase your retirement savings   how much are you able to contribute to retirement now   i think you would be lucky to do $ and most months probably less than that   however if you were making like 60k year and allowed a little lifestyle bloat you could probably easy put away 20k year   once you are able to do that the savings you can manage now will be quickly    often times when people consider having their money work for them they often neglect to factor risk   prior to investing one should have a proper emergency fund in place   that is 6 months or so of living expenses in a nice safe savings account   those earn about 1.25 these days which is pretty meager but it does earn something    once the emergency fund is in place one can invest with impunity   without it you will have to liquidate investments if economic calamity strikes you   this could be done at a loss furthering the harm done by the calamity    increase your income and create an emergency fund   do those things first

you do n't deduct transaction fees but they are included in your cost basis and proceeds which will affect the amount of gain loss you report so in your example the cost basis for each of the two lots is $ 15 10 $ share price plus $ 5 broker fee   your proceeds for each lot are $ 27.50 $ 30 2 $ 5   your gain on each lot is therefore $ 12.50 and you will report $ 12.50 in and $ 12.50 in ltcg in the year you sold the stock year 3    as to the other fees in general yes they are deductible but there are limits and exceptions so you would need to consult a tax professional to get a correct answer in your specific situation

now to buy in full and essentially have zero savings buy in part £ 10000 deposit followed by a loan of £ 4000 or hp more of the value so you are assessing if the car is worth having with either none or only 4,000 in savings this is the most critical information you have provided    my outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as i hate the idea of loans and interest with the amount of money that you currently possess i believe the buy in part option is best as it reduces your interest liability but i do n't believe you should do it currently 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night    as for your question of interest this is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend rows four and seven respectively this is your money and no one can tell you what 's best to do with it than yourself keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart depreciation fluctuates to the buyer so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2 3 years hope it all goes well my friend

true blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity   they are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity since it is a credit like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income it will perform much more like a bond rising when interest rates fall and vice versa and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities   if the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall there are more modern preferred however   it has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares   because these are derivatives based upon the common equity they can be expected to be much more variant

one way to think of the typical fixed rate mortgage is that you can calculate the balance at the end of the month add a month 's interest rate times balance then divide by 12 then subtract your payment the principal is now a bit less and there 's a snowball effect that continues to drop the principal more each month   even though some might object to my use of the word compounding a prepayment has that effect e.g. you have a 5 mortgage and pay $ 100 extra principal if you did nothing else 5 compounded over 28 years is about so if you did this early on it would reduce the last payment by about $ 400 obviously there are calculators and spreadsheets that can give the exact numbers   i do n't know the rules for car loans but one would actually expect them to work similarly and no you are not crazy to expect that just the opposite

simple there is no magic price adjustment after sales why do you expect the stock price to change the listed price of a stock is what someone was willing to pay for it in the last deal that was concluded if any amount of stock changes ownership this might have the effect that other people are willing to buy it for a higher price or not it is solely in the next buyer 's decision what he is willing to pay example if you think apple stocks are worth 500 $ a piece and i buy a million of them you might still think they are worth or you might see this as a reason that they are worth 505 $ now

there are some who argue that you should lease an electric car these factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying the technology is still new and is advancing rapidly in 2 3 years the newer model may have significantly improved features range and efficiency as well as lower prices if you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest leasing can make it a smoother transition it is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles this is both because of the above factors but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined the models for predicting gas car prices have been for decades ev manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations when you lease a car you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value if at the end of the lease the market value of the car is higher than the residual value you can purchase the car at the predetermined price making yourself some extra money if the value is lower than the residual you can return the car or renegotiate i know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it the rest bought used vehicles coming off lease which can also be a good deal

i 'd suggest you avoid the roth for now and use pretax accounts to get the greatest return i 'd deposit to the 401(k enough to get as much match as permitted then use a traditional ira you should understand how tax brackets work and aim to use pre tax to the extent it helps you avoid the 25 rate if any incremental deposit would be 15 money use roth for that most discussions of the pre tax post tax decision talk about 2 rates that at the time of deposit and time of withdrawal there are decades in between that should n't be ignored if you have any life change a marriage child home purchase etc there 's a chance your marginal bracket drops back down to 15 that 's the time to convert to roth just enough to top off the 15 bracket   last i would n't count on that pension there 's too much time until you retire to count on that income few people stay at one job long enough to collect on the promise of a pension that takes 30 + years to earn and even if you did there 's the real chance the company cancels the plan long before you retire

a stock price is nothing but the price at which some shares of that stock were sold on an exchange from someone willing to sell those shares at that price or more to someone willing to buy them at that price or less pretty much every question about how stock prices work is answered by the paragraph above which an astonishingly large number of people do n't seem to be aware of so there is no explicit tracking mechanism at all just people buying and selling and if the current going price on two exchanges differ then that is an opportunity for someone to make money by buying on one exchange and selling on the other until the prices are close enough that the fees and overhead make that activity unprofitable this is called arbitrage and a common activity of investment banks or more recently hedge funds and specialized trading firms spun off by said banks due to regulation

why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these    instead of also having to carry the weight of the other    450 some of which are mostly just baggage first a cap weighted index fund will invest more heavily in larger cap companies so the baggage you speak of does take up a smaller percentage of the portfolio 's value not that cap always equates to better performance there are also equal weighted index funds where each company in the index is given equal weight in the portfolio if you could accurately pick winners and losers then of course you could beat index funds but on average they 've performed well enough that there 's little incentive for the average investor to look elsewhere   a handful of stocks opens you up to more risk an enron in your handful would be pretty devastating if it comprised a large percentage of your portfolio additionally since you pay a fee on each transaction $ 5 in your example you have to out perform a low fee index fund significantly or be investing a very large amount of money to come out ahead you get diversification and low fees with an index fund

the way the question is worded it is slightly opinion based just to point out    tax benefits upto 50000 inr is tax free when invested here this is actually 200,000 inr under 80c. so if you invest max of 150,000 in other instruments in 80c you can still invest 50,000 into nps hopefully it will provide some money that i could probably use to buy a house kid 's education kid 's marriage there are very few withdrawal options generally in the current scenario by the time you retire you would already have house kid would have got married answers given the current data is it a worthwhile investment it is a good investment option available it is up to individual to select this or invest else where if yes would be better to fix choice at 50 in e and 25 in c and e or go for the auto choice as you are young it is better to have max 50 in equity and actively monitor this and change the percentage as you near the retirement age if you do n't have time or are not financial or one is plain simple lazy going with auto choice makes sense bad investment because if you put the same money into equity oriented mutual funds then you will get better returns this depends if you are currently investing everything into equity then yes at absolute level the returns are high however if you are investing into equity and debt to achieve a balance then nps is doing it automatically for you as the nps has very low costs there is substantial advantage in some years 2013 2014 the nps equity return has been excellent and exceeded leading mutual funds other aspect edits the annuities need to invest in guaranteed risk free instruments generally bonds as the rates are locked for life they need to factor things like average life expectancy demographics etc this is largely statistical similar to how the insurance premiums are decided this is adjusted periodically say they offer 6.5 for 100 people the investments into bonds is yielding only 6 then for next 100 people they would offer 5.5 however if the mortality increases i.e. 50 people die at age of 70 they just need to adjust it to 5.75 for next 100 so there are quite a few parameters that go in and models output what the rate should be offered at times the corpus manager may take a hedge to minimize downside this is a specialized subject and there no dummies that show how rates are determined it is also a trade secret

the answers here are all correct   this is 100 scam beyond any reasonable doubt   do n't fall for it   however i felt it valuable to explain what would happen were you to fall for this   it 's not all that hard to understand but it involves understanding some of the time delays that exist in modern banking today the most important thing to understand is that depositing a check does not actually put dollars in your account even though it appears to   a check is not legal tender for debts public and private   it 's a piece of paper known as a bill of exchange   it 's an authorization for a payee you to request that their bank pay you the amount on the check   a transaction made with a check does not actually draw to a close until your bank and their bank communicate and cause the actual transfer of funds to take place   this process is called clearing the check despite living in the modern times this process is slow   it can take 7 10 days to clear a check especially if it is an international bank   this is not good for the banking business   you can imagine how difficult it would be to tell a poor client who is living paycheck to paycheck that he ca n't have his pay until the check clears a week later   banks have an interest in hiding this annoying feature of the modern banking system so they do   when you deposit a check the bank will typically advance you the money an interest free loan in effect while the check floats i.e. until it clears   this creates the illusion that the money is actually in your account for most intents and purposes   presumably a bank would distinguish between the floating check and a cleared check if you tried to close out your account but otherwise it looks and feels like the money is in your hands of course if the check is because the payer had insufficient funds or the account simply did not exist your bank will not get the money   at this moment they will cancel any advances you received and notify you that the check bounced   again this happens 7 10 days later the general pattern of this scam is that they will pay you by a method which clears slowly like a check   they will then ask you to withdraw the money using a faster clearing method like a wire transfer or withdrawing the cash   typically they will be encouraging you to move quickly they are on a timetable when their check bounces the game is up   at this time it will appear as though the account has a positive balance but in fact it has a negative balance plus an advance on the check   this looks great until 7 10 days later when the check bounces   at that time the bank will cancel the advance and reality will set in   you will now have an open bank account legally opened by you in your own name which is deeply in debt   meanwhile the scammer walks away with all the money that you sent them which cleared quickly there are many variants which can hide the details   some can play games with check kiting to try to make your first check clear then try to rope you in for a more painful hit   some will change the instruments they use checks are the easy ones so they 're simply most common   do n't try to think maybe this one is legit   these scammers literally make a living off of making shady transactions look legit things i would recommend looking out for

there are several reasons why this may happen and i will update as i get more information from you volumes on that stock look low supposing that they are either in a factor between and 1000s so it could well be that there was no volume on that day if no trades occur then open high and low are meaningless as they are statistics based on trades that occur that day and no trades occur remember that there has to be volume to get a price the stock may have been frozen by either the exchange or the company for the day this could be for various reasons including to prevent some illegal activity in that case no trades were made because the market for that stock was closed another possibility is that all trades that day were cancelled by the exchange the exchange may cancel all trades if there is unusual potentially fraudulent or other illegal activity on the stock in this case the last price for that day existed but was rolled back by the exchange and never occurred this is a rare situation although i ca n't find any holidays on that date it is possible that this is how your data provider marks market holidays it would be valid to ignore the data in that case as being from a non market day i can not tell if this is possible without knowing exchange information there is a possibility that some data providers do n't receive data for a day or that it gets corrupted it may be worth checking another source to ensure the integrity of the data that you are receiving whichever reason is true the data provider has made the close equal to the previous day 's close as no price movements occurred strictly the closing price is the price of the last trade made for that day and so should be null and open high and low should be null too and not 0 otherwise the price change on day is very large therefore to keep integrity you have a few choices

the short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination of a debt is a taxable exchange and gains or losses are possible for the stock investor as well as the bank    the somewhat longer answer is best summarized as noting that banks do n't usually accept stocks as collateral mostly because stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers    in the usa as a practical matter i only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock as part of the standard services of a margin account you can get a margin account at any us stock broker the stockholder can deposit their shares in the margin account and then borrow around 50 of the value though that is a bit much to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment in the form of margin calls in a brokerage account i can not imagine a need to repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges   trouble begins as the stock value goes down   when the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage of the stock value which can depend on the stock and the broker 's policy but is also subject to federal rules like regulation t the broker can call in the loan and/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan    notice that this may result in a capital gain or loss depending on the investor 's tax basis which is usually the original cost of the stock   of course this sale affects the taxes of the investor of who gets the money

suppose you have been paying interest on previous charges in the past your monthly statement is issued on april 12 and since you just received your income tax refund you pay it off in full on april 30   you do n't charge anything to the card at all after april 12   thus on april 30 your credit card balance   shows as zero since you just paid it off   but your april 12 statement billed you for interest only till april 12   so on may 12 your next monthly bill will be for the interest for your nonzero balance from april 13 through april 30 assuming that you still are not making any new charges on your card and pay off the may 12 bill in timely fashion you will finally have a zero bill on june 12 what if you charge new items to your credit card after april 12 well your balance stopped revolving on april 30 and that 's when interest is no longer charged on the new charges but you do owe interest for a charge on april 13 say until april 30 when your balance is no longer revolving and this will be added to your bill on may 12 purchases made after april 30 will not be charged interest unless you fall off the wagon again and do n't pay your may 12 bill in full by the due date of the bill some time in early june

okay so we are assuming that you can sustain 6 or more return on your investments    personally i would compare that rate to what lines of credit are going for and do what ever is least expensive    either way your risk is the same   your net worth is the same   your assets will be the same your liabilities will be the same its just a matter of who you owe it to and what the rate is do n't be afraid of having a second mortgage   if the stocks go down either way you have to sell what 's left and pay your debt or what i should maybe say is do n't be more afraid of a line of credit more than margin in your investment account

the irs no longer requires that employers submit all w4 forms but they can request a w4 for an employee at any time and putting false information on your w4 is still a punishable offense    i agree that having a return is like giving the treasury department an interest free loan for the year but unfortunately paying the appropriate amount of withholding tax is required    there is some ambiguous information regarding an employer adjusting the amount of withholding but it seems to mean that they can withhold more than the estimated rate but never less than what is calculated using the deductions on your w4 see the link for more details irs tax withholding

when you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts or start receiving pension and social security funds in addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts   but even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments the proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate during retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions what to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire    if your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure you will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non retirement investment account if trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure   of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle family obligations or winning the lottery

not sure where the confusion is coming from software digital intangible goods are just like any other product with regard to vat turns out it 's being made complicated by hmrc anyone would think they enjoy making everyone who collects tax for free on their behalf a crook you charge customers everywhere in the eu vat and pay it to hmrc the only exception being customers outside the uk who can provide you with a vat number for these customers you are free to not charge vat as it 's assumed they would be it in their home country anyway the above is true until 2015 when the rules become more relaxed you will not need a vat number from customers outside the uk in order to exempt yourself from collecting vat turns out you need to be part of the moss scheme more here which was set up to prevent you having to register for vat in every country you sell your software unless you only sell through app stores and then it 's easier because each sale is treated as you selling your software to the store for it to be sold on you can reclaim all vat on your eligible purchases in the uk just as any other uk vat registered business would usual rules apply and of course you do n't collect vat from anyone outside the eu so you can either reduce the price of your software or pocket the additional 20

yeah pretty much most hotels will have a long term rate that 's much cheaper if you 're staying weeks or months at a time however it 's not something that they highly publicize because otherwise normal hotel guests can feel that they 're being overcharged the weekly rate usually applies to bookings longer than three weeks and the monthly rate for those more than three months the place i stayed at also had 6 monthly and 12 monthly rates which were even less again and i knew some people who had been living there for 2 3 years   although i guess it depends on your budget when you compare the rates of corporate short stay accommodation you can sometimes get a better deal from a hotel if you just call and negotiate something there was an article i read about this a few years back on some dude who started doing this because it worked out cheaper than keeping a permanent place in london and a place in ny but i ca n't for the life of me find it now

well first problem is usually that you are trying to do too much you end up micro managing once a company becomes large enough this is impossible to keep doing at the same level    if you find that you do n't have enough time maybe it 's time to either hire someone new or promote transfer someone you need to trust and give freedom to your employees to do their job in their own way which may or may not be better than yours communicate with each at intervals    a lot of business owners struggle with this because it costs them money and that is wrong it 's cost your company money which is a separate entity than you a piece of property that makes you less money than the week before is still making you money you are not losing money so get that out of your head it 's not your money until you take it out of the business until then that money including profits are the property of the business this is how the law see it by the way    marginally an understaffed store will make a larger percentage of profits from revenue a well staffed store will make more actual profits from more actual revenue because it can handle the business coming into the store better which in turns should lead to more business on a particular day you may see more money in profit from an understaffed store someone calls out let 's say   but trust me when i say that will not continue for very long    on of the biggest challenges new business owners face is they are as in they do n't spend the money they need to this means buying new equipment and hiring and giving raises and promotions so you can handle new business as well let say you are making t shirts or really adding new designs to pre made plain shirts you can only press one at a time which for a while is enough but eventually you are going to need another press so you can do 2 at a time but a lot business owners will somehow expect an employee to produce more with what he has now orders are n't being filed and you are in a panic and possibly angry but guess what you are angry at the employee not the fact you were to stupid to realize that he needs 2 presses to do the job correctly that 's your own fault and you 're blind to it because you feel as if you are working twice as hard than them because of the problem you created and let 's say the problem is different now the press is n't getting hot enough and it take 20 per shirt to get it to stay on correctly and you decide to never fix it then a light goes out then blank then blank and suddenly you realize finally all of this needs to be replaced at the same time i 've seen things like this happen in new and old businesses things work fine for the first 5 years then normal maintenance is forgotten have a depreciation fund ready so it does n't feel like you are spending any money that 's what that fund is for and you put into it from the beginning need a $ 2k equipment i have $ 4k saved for this already it was money intended to be spent on this    but of course some of this is going to depend on the type of business you are running and since you have provided us no details i ca n't give an answer for you because all businesses are different but i feel that these things refusing to give freedom and authority to other employees and refusing to spend money when needed are the biggest pitfalls most business owners fall into

if i donate $ 10,000 to charity then i can deduct that $ 10,000 from my income and not pay income taxes on it   so if i make $ 50,000 a year then i will only pay income taxes on $ 40,000 instead of $ 50,000 since i donated $ 10,000 to charity   this is what is meant when charity contributions are said to be tax deductible do n't feel like you have to donate to charity   you owe no one anything   you do more for others by working assuming you work in the private sector if you know of someone personally that is in need of aid then you could give them some help directly   i find this more effective then blindly dumping money in a bureaucratic inefficient charity   i also find there are very few people in need of charity personally i think charity donations are a way for people to feel good about themselves   they rarely care if their donations are effective

are you trying to figure out if a project would increase the market value of equity      i think your issue is that the market value of equity will not be updated with the npv of 40 m assuming it is truly + not sure if it 's true with 50 m of debt       ev = market value of equity + debt cash and ce    ev debt + cash and ce = market equity value      so i think you would have to update the market value of equity up with this would then lead to ev = equity value + future income stream discounted + debt cash and cash equivalents

this might not be the answer you are looking for but the alternative to do n't patronize these merchants is this do patronize these merchants and pay cash    credit cards are convenient   i use a credit card often   however there is no denying that they cost the merchants an incredible amount in fees and that our entire economy is paying for these fees   the price of everything is more than it needs to be because of these fees   yes you get some money back with your rewards card but the money you get back comes directly from the store you made the purchase with and the reward is paid for by increasing the price of everything you buy   in addition those among us that do not have the credit score necessary to obtain a rewards card are paying the same higher price for goods as the rest of us but do n't get the cash back reward honestly it seems quite fair to me that only the people charging purchases to a credit card should have to pay the extra fee that goes along with that payment processing   if a store chooses to do that i pay cash instead and i am grateful for the discount

i use 10-k and to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business sometimes they are very comical but when you see that risk factor you can understand how it will effect the company for example one company 's risk factor stated that if elizabeth warren becomes head of the consumer financial protection bureau we will have a hard time so we are expanding in mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there i like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more an example was where i heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management poor questionable misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so i started digging into their sec filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher while experiencing no change in market cap but then digging further i saw that they were only changing the already issued shares but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares i that this would mean the share prices would drop by after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this employees or the broad market i was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if i could borrow their shares to short because there was n't enough liquidity on the stock market this was almost the perfect short but it was n't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all it traded from $ 20 after the reverse split to $ i like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon this is generally what i use those particular forms for but they contain a lot of information a lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read

i have managed two ira accounts one i inherited from my wife 's 401 k and my own 's   i managed actively my wife 's 401 at which does n't restrict on options except level 5 as naked puts and calls i moved half of my funds to tdameritrade the only broker authorized by my employer to open a self directed account   however my 457 plan disallows me from using a cash secured puts only covered calls   for those who does not know investing i resent the contention that participants to these iras should not be messing around with their ira funds   for years i left my funds with my current fund custodian great west financial   i checked it 's current values once or twice a year these last years the market in the last 2 quarters of 2015 and another dive early january and february of 2016   i lost a total of $ 40 k leaving my portfolio with my current custodian choosing all 30 products they offer 90 of them are etfs and the rest are bonds if you do n't know investing better leave it with the pros right   but no one can predict the future of the market   even the pros are at the mercy of the market so i you know how to invest and choose your stocks i do n't think your plan administrator has to limit you on how you manage your funds for example if you are not allowed to place a cash secured puts and you just buy the stocks or eft at market or even limit order you buy the securities at their market value if you sell a cash secured puts against the stocks etf you are interested in buying you will receive a credit in fraction of a dollar in a specific time frame   in average your cost to owning a stock etf is lesser if you buy it at market or even a limit order   most of the participants of the ira funds rely too much on their portfolio manager because they do n't know how to manage if you try to educate yourself at a minimum you will have a good understanding of how your ira funds are tied up to the market   if you know how to trade in bear market compared to bull market then you are good at managing your investments   when i started contributing to my employer 's deferred comp account as a public employee i have no idea of how my portfolio works   year after year as i looked at my investment i was happy because it continued to grow   without how much it grew yearly and my regular payroll contribution i am happy even it only grew 2 per year   and at this age that i am ready to retire at 60 i started taking investment classes and attended pre retirement seminars   then i knew that it was not totally a good decision to leave your retirement funds in the hands of the portfolio manager since they do n't really care if it tanked out on some years as long at overall it grew to a meager because they managers are pretty conservative on picking the equities they invest   you can generalize that maybe 90 of ira investors do n't know about investing and have poor decision making actions which securities etf to buy and hold for those who would like to remain as one that is fine   but for those who spent time and money to study and know how to invest i do n't think the plan manager can limit the participants ability to manage their own portfolio especially if the funds have no matching from the employer like mine all i can say to all who have ira or any retirement accounts educate yourself early because if you leave it all to your portfolio managers you lost a lot   do n't believe much in what those commercial fund managers also show in their presentation just to move your funds for them to manage   be proactive   if you start learning how to invest now when you are young just do it

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

there 's an old adage in the equities business buy on rumor sell on fact   sometimes the strategy is to buy as soon as the rumor is out about a potential merger and then sell off into the news when it is actually announced since this is normally when the biggest bounce occurs as part of a merger the other part of the analysis you should do is to understand which of the companies benefits most or is hurt the worst by the merger and then make your play accordingly   sometimes the company being acquired will see a bounce while the acquiring firm takes a hit which is an indication the experts think the acquisition will be a drag on the acquiring company perhaps because it is taking on a great deal of debt to make the acquisition or because the acquiring firm is paying too much of a premium for what it 's getting in return   other times the exact opposite is true where the company being acquired takes a hit while the buyer bounces and again the reasons for this can vary widely if you wait until the merger is actually announced then by the time you get in most of the premium from the announcement will likely have already been realized and you 'll be buying near the top of the market for the stock   the key is to be ahead of the other sellers by seeing the opportunities before they do and then knowing when to get out before everyone else does   not an easy thing to pull off when you 're trying to anticipate the markets but it can be done if you do the right research and have patience good luck

i am a bit unsure of why the interest rate is relevant   are you intending on borrowing the money to go to school   if you can not pay cash then it is very likely a bad idea   many people are overcome by events when seeking higher education and such a loan on a such a salary could devastate you financially    so i find the cost of the program as a total of k counting a loss in salary during the program and the first year grant   that is a lot of money do you intend to borrow that much   especially when you consider that your salary after you graduate will be about equal to where you are now   for that reason i am leaning toward a no even if you had the cash in hand to do so    there is nothing to say that you will enjoy teaching   furthermore teaching in low income school is more challenging    all that said is there a way you can raise your income without going back to school   washington state can be a very expensive place to live and is one of the reason why i left   i am a alumni go   could you cash flow a part time program instead i would give this a sound no ymmv

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

you want to buy a house for $ 150,000   it may be possible to do this with $ 10,000 and a 3.5 downpayment but it would be a lot better to have $ 40,000 and make a 20 downpayment   that would give you a cushion in case house prices fall and there are often advantages to a 20 downpayment lower rate less mandatory insurance    you have an income of $ 35,000 and expenses of $ 23,000 if you are careful with the money what if you are n't   you should have savings of either $ 17,500 or $ 11,500 in case of emergencies   perhaps you simply were n't mentioning that   note that you also need at least $ 137 26 = $ more to cover mortgage payments so $ by the expenses standard   this is in addition to the $ 40,000 for downpayment and closing costs    what do you plan to do if there is a problem with the new house e.g. you need a new roof   or smaller expenses like a new furnace or appliance   a plumbing problem   damages from a storm   what if the tenants teenage child has a party and the place   what if your tenants stop paying rent but refuse to move out trashing the place while being evicted   your emergency savings need to be able to cover those situations    you checked comps comparable properties   great   but notice that you are looking at a one bathroom property for $ 150,000 and comparing to $ 180,000 houses   consider that you may not get the $ 235 for that house which is cheaper   perhaps the rent for that house will only be $ or less because one bathroom does n't really support three bedrooms of people    while real estate can be part of a portfolio balance would suggest that much more of your portfolio be in things like stocks and bonds   what are you doing for retirement   are you maxing out any tax advantaged options that you have available   it might be better to do that before entering the real estate market    i am a 23 year old australian man with a degree in computer science and a steady job from home working as a web developer i 'm a bit unclear on this   what makes the job steady   is it employment with a large company   are you self employed with what has been a steady flow of customers   regardless of which it is consider the possibility of a recession   the company can lay you off presumably you are at the bottom of the seniority   the new customers may be reluctant to start new projects while their cash flow is restrained   and your tenants may move out   at the same time   what will you do then    a mortgage is an obligation   you have to pay it regardless   while currently flush are you the kind of flush that can weather a major setback   i would feel a lot better about an investment like this if you had $ 600,000 in savings and were using this as a complementary investment to broaden your portfolio   even if you had $ 60,000 in savings and would still have substantial savings after the purchase   this feels more like you are trying to maximize your purchase   money burning a hole in your pocket and trying to escape    it would be a lot safer to stick to securities   the worst that happens there is that you lose your investment and it 's more likely that the value will be reduced but recover   with mortgages you can lose your entire investment and then some   yes the price may recover but it may do so after the bank forecloses on the mortgage

it says expense ratio of 0.14 what does it mean essentially it means that they will take 0.14 of your money regardless of the performance this measures how much money the fund spends out of its assets on the regular management expenses how much taxes will i be subject to this depends on your personal situation not much to do with the fund though investment rebalancing policies may affect the taxable distributions if you hold it in your ira there will be no taxes at all however some funds do have measures of non taxable distributions vs dividends vs. capital gains not all the funds do that and these are very rough estimates anyway what is considered to be a reasonable expense ratio that depends greatly on the investment policy for passive index funds 0.05 0.5 is a reasonable range while for actively managed funds it can go up as much as 2 and higher you need to compare to other funds with similar investment policies to see where your fund stands

another completely different way to look at your huge mistake it 's not a huge mistake you 're getting your money out of a restricted account   you 're paying taxes now plus an extra tax of 10 to regain some of your privacy of where you 're putting your money you 're paying up now as a trade off to paying much later when the rules can be completely different and the tax rates much higher you 're deciding not to put the money into another restricted account which has yearly reporting requirements to the irs above and beyond those required with taxable earnings it 's a cost benefit analysis whether you roll your money over to an ira account or not   you hear about the benefits a lot more often than you hear about the costs which it what i 'm introducing you to with my answer

i see two ways you can handle this use the gifts for the purpose of creating more free software   this is fundraising and your cause is writing free software   the language is a little tricky from the paypal donate button emphasis mine this button is intended for fundraising if you are not raising money    for a cause please choose another option nonprofits must verify    their status to withdraw donations they receive users that are not    verified nonprofits must demonstrate how their donations will be used    once they raise more than $ 10,000 usd you do n't have to be a nonprofit they are only requiring existing nonprofits to verify their status   you do n't even have to account for the donations if they are below $ 10,000 give out your paypal email address and instruct the gift givers to simply send you money through their paypal interface   they can mark it as a gift when they send the money i think option one is how the various bloggers and other personal users are their collection of donations and i think its a valid use of the paypal donate button

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

disclaimer i am not an accountant nor a tax pro etc etc yes a canadian corporation can function as a partial income tax shelter   this is possible since a corporation can retain earnings profits indefinitely and corporate income tax rates are generally less than personal income tax rates   details if you own and run your business through a corporation you can choose to take income from your corporation in one of two ways   as salary or as dividends salary constitutes an expense of the corporation i.e. it gets deducted from revenue in calculating corporate taxable income   no corporate income tax is due on money paid out as salary   however personal income taxes and other deductions e.g. cpp would apply to salary at regular rates the same as for a regular employee dividends are paid by the corporation to shareholders out of after tax profits   i.e. the corporation first pays income tax on taxable income for the fiscal year and resulting net income could be used to pay dividends or not at the personal level dividends are taxed less than salary to account for tax the corporation paid   the net effect of corporate + personal tax is about the same as for salary leaving out deductions like cpp the key point dividends do n't have to be paid out in the year the money was earned   the corporation can carry profits forward retained earnings as long as it wants and choose to issue dividends or not in later years given that here 's how would the partial income tax shelter works at some point for you to personally realize income from the corporation you can have the corporation declare a dividend you 'll then have to pay personal income taxes on the income at the dividend rates   but for as long as the money was invested inside the corporation it was subject only to lesser corporate tax rates not higher personal income tax rates   hence the partial aspect of this kind of tax shelter or if you 're lucky enough to find a buyer for your corporation you could qualify for the lifetime capital gains exemption on proceeds up to $ 750,000 when you sell a qualified small business corporation   this is the best exit strategy unfortunately not an easy one where the business has no valuable assets e.g. a client base or intellectual property the major sticking point   you need to have real business revenue   a regular employee of another company ca n't funnel his personally earned employment income into a corporation just to take advantage of this mechanism   sorry

gt also if accounting decides to hire a bunch of new employees why should the cost for the computers come out of it 's budget    what does it even mean for something to come out of it 's budget as far as i can tell what it means is that you do n't understand the difference between a planning tool and a t account   gt as long as it 's budget is to the whims of other departments you ca n't really call it a budget at all rather it is just a pool of money that anyone can dip in to   budgets are n't pools of money at all they 're planning tools actual pools of money are t accounts i am nearly 100 certain that your it department does n't not have its own t account though once the distinction between budgets and t accounts are so thoroughly confused that you are commonly saying things come out of our budget the next logical step can appear to be inter charge backs   the reality is that business expenses are driven by growth and constrained by cash flow managers must learn how to produce budgets that anticipate growth so that cash flow can be managed by the accountants and so that executives can make decisions about priorities   doing inter department charge backs is a way of doing this in an organization whose relationships are so fucked up that you ca n't do it by actually talking to each other have fun with that

a suitable mix of index funds is a great option if you do n't want to spend a lot of time and effort micromanaging your money if you find amusement in pushing numbers around you may be able to do better notice may if you have multiple millions you can hire someone of that sort to push the numbers around for you they may do better for you notice may and remember that part of your additional gains have to go to pay them which means they have to do better just to be worth having on staff in the first place if you have more than that there are some options available which smaller investors really ca n't get involved in as one example if you have enough money that you can lose $ 100 k without especially noticing you can get involved in venture capital and the like which require a large commitment and are higher risk but can yield higher returns anyone who 's dismissing index funds as only for beginners is being foolish but recommending them to beginners in particular is a good thing since they let you get into the market with fairly predictable risk benefits without needing a massive investment in education and time

i am quite sure you can set up an office in your basement for a lot less than $ 15,000 do n't build any walls install any flooring or upgrade the ceiling just install more lights and plugs set up your desks and what not in whatever corner is furthest from like the laundry room or the furnace the kids and the nanny get the main floor just let the whole living room be a giant for example this gives you the separation you need to work at home but you can hear if something really needs your attention   when the kids go off to school you can the basement into a for kids who do n't always need supervision using the money you are no longer spending on the nanny to install real walls a drop ceiling and so on your office stuff can move up to the main floor or to a spare room upstairs if you had one but it was n't usable during the baby years when upstairs generally has to be quiet as the kids get older the basement can get tailored to what and teens like this is essentially what we did and our square and child counts match yours almost precisely we did eventually convert our garage to and finished space and it spent time as an office with staff coming in each day then some time as a teen think video games and loud music after the business rented office space outside the house but if you do n't intend to hire staff for your business you do n't need to do this part we did the majority of the basement wiring ourselves and got an electrician to hook it into the panel and check our work the budget would probably be less than 10 of the guess from your real estate agent

i will answer the question from the back who can not afford luxury cars those whose parents paid for their college education can not afford luxury cars but buy them anyway why i have what may seem a rather shocking proposition related to the point of not saving for kids college parents do not owe children a college education why should they did your parents fund your college or did you get it through a mix of pell grants loans and work if they did then you owe them $ back for it adjusted for inflation if they did not well then why do you feel your children deserve more than you deserved when you were a child you do not owe your children a college education they owe it to themselves gifts do not set one up for success they set one up for dependence    i will add one more hypothesis financial discipline is best learned through one 's own experiences when an 18 + year old adult gets a very large amount of money as a gift every year for several years in the form of paid tuition does that teach them frugality and responsibility my proposition is that those who get a free ride on their parents backs are not well served in terms of becoming disciplined they become the subjects of the question in this post those why buy cars and houses they can not afford and pay for vacations with credit cards we reap what we as a society   of course college is only one case in point but a very illustrative one the bigger point is that financial discipline can only be developed when there are opportunities to develop it such opportunities arise under one important condition financial independence   what does buying children cars for their high school graduation buying them 4 years of college tuition and buying them who knows what else study abroad trips airfare apartment leases textbooks etc etc teach does it teach independence or dependence   it can certainly at least that 's what you hope for teach them to appreciate when others do super nice things for them but does free money instill financial responsibility   try to ask kids whose parents paid for their college why they did it because my parents want me to succeed is probably the best you can hope for now ask them but do your parents owe you a college education why yes i guess they do why well i guess because they told me they do they said they owe it to me to set me up for success in life now think about this do people who become financially successful achieve that success because someone owed something to them or because they recognized that nobody owes them anything and took it upon themselves to create that success for themselves these are not very comfortable topics to consider especially for those of you who have either already sunk many tens of thousands of dollars into your childrens college education or for those who have been living very frugally and for the past 10 15 years driven by the goal of doing so but i want to open this can of worms because i believe fundamentally it may be creating more problems than it is solving i am sure there are some historical and cultural explanations for the assumption that has at some point formed in the american society that parents owe their children a college education   but as with most social conventions it is merely an idea a shared belief it has become so ingrained in conversations at work parties and family that it seems that many of those who are advocates of the idea of paying for their childrens education no longer even understand why they feel that way they simply go with the flow of social expectations unwilling or unable to question either the premises behind these expectations or the long term consequences and results of such expectations   with this comment i want to point to the connection between the free financial gifts that parents give to their adult children and the level of financial discipline of these young adults their spending habits sense of entitlement and sense of responsibility over their financial decisions the statistics of the u.s. savings rate average credit card debt foreclosures and bankruptcy indeed tell a troubling story   my point is that these trends do n't just happen because of lots of tv advertising and the proverbial jones 's these trends happen because of a lack of financial education discipline and experience with balancing one 's own checkbook perhaps we need to think more deeply about the consequences of our socially motivated decisions as parents and what is really in our children 's best interests not while they are in college but while they live the rest of their lives after college finally to all the 18 + adult children who are from the traumatic experience of not having their parents pay for their college while some of their friends parents totally did i have this perspective to offer   like you are now your parents are adults their money is theirs to spend because it was theirs to earn you are under no obligation to pay for your parents retirement not that you were going to similarly your parents have no obligation to pay for your college they can spend their money on absolutely whatever they want be it a cottage vacations a or slots in the casino how they spend their money is their concern only and has nothing to do with your adult needs such as college education   if your parents their finances and go bankrupt it is their obligation to get themselves back in the black not yours if you have the means and may be so inclined you may help them if you do not or are not fair enough regardless of what you do they will still love you as their child no less   similarly if your parents have the means and are so inclined they may help you if they do not or are not fair enough regardless of what they do you are to love them as your parents no less   your task as an adult is to focus on how you will meet your own financial needs not to dwell on which of your needs were not met by people whose finances should well be completely separate from yours at this point in life for an adult to harbor an expectation of receiving something of value for free is misguided it unjustified illusory entitlement it is the expectation of someone who is clueless as to the value of money measured by the effort and time needed to earn it when adults want to acquire stuff or services they have to pay for these things with their own money that 's how adults live when adults want to get a massage or take a ride in a cab are they by their parents obligation to pay for these services no they realize that it 's their own responsibility to take care of these needs they either need to earn the money to pay for these things or buy them on credit and pay off the debt later   education is a type of service just like a massage or a cab ride it is a service that you decide you need to get in order to do xyz become smarter get a better paying job join a profession etc therefore as with any other service the primary responsibility for paying for this service is yours   you have 3 options or their combination work now so that you can earn the money to pay for this service later work part time while you are receiving this service acquire the service on credit and work later to pay it off that 's it this is called the real world the better you can deal with it the more successful you will become in it good luck

for the requirement for risk free and hassle free account a cd or money market account through your local bank credit union or even large online bank will be fine these funds wo n't grow very fast over time but they are safe and insured these types of accounts are perfect for all the miscellaneous birthday holiday and religious event checks there is not a requirement that the money be in a ugma uniform gifts to minors act account putting it in a ugma account does make it hard for the parents to spend the irs does allow the child to have earnings from banks without the formality of a ugma the money should n't be moved between the parent 's and child 's account but it is possible for the parents to spend the child 's money if times are tight and the money is used for items that benefit the child if there is a reasonable assumption of college then the 529 plan makes a lot of sense the prepaid tuition options would be risky because they tend to be tied to a single state and who knows where they will be living in 10 to 15 years the 529 does focus the money to be used for educational expenses but it can be used for non educational expenses if you are willing to pay the taxes and penalties it can also be transferred to another child later or even other family members in my state the 529 plan does n't have to be used right after high school graduation it can be used up to 30 years after graduation so they can decide a few years later that they want to go back to school

the interest bearing mortgage of £ 300,000 would be six times your salary that 's a ratio that was found in japan and i believe was a main reason for their depressed economy of the past two decades even with an interest free loan of nearly £ 150,000 it would be a huge gamble for someone of your income essentially you are gambling that 1 your income will grow into your mortgage and that 's counting income from renting part of the property or 2 the house will rise in value thereby bailing you out that was a gamble that many americans took and lost in the past ten years if you do this you may be one of the lucky ones you may not but you are really taking your future in your hands   the american rule of thumb is that your mortgage should be no more than 2.5 3 times income that is maybe up to £ 150,000 perhaps £ 200,000 if £ 50,000 or so of that is interest free but not to the numbers you 're talking about

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

the globe and mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your rrsps be aware that the article is from early 2011 and rules change they describe holding your own mortgage inside your rrsp that is if you have $ 100,000 inside your rrsp already and your remaining mortgage is $ 100,000 you can use that money to pay off your mortgage then pay back the money at interest generating a tax deferred profit inside your rrsp that approach may be viable though you 'd want to talk to your accountant first i 'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my rrsp though second mortgages are inherently risky so this is a very speculative investment once you make an rrsp contribution that space is used up barring a couple of exceptions such as the life long learning plan so let 's say you used $ 100,000 of your rrsp to loan to someone for a second mortgage any interest payments should be sheltered inside the rrsp substantial benefit but if the person defaults on the second mortgage which you should expect to be a significant possibility you 've lost your entire $ 100,000 contribution room as well as obviously the $ 100,000 that you loaned out i ca n't tell you whether or not it makes sense to invest in risky second mortgage loans and i ca n't tell you whether if you choose to do so it definitely should be done inside an rrsp there are substantial risks in the loan and there are both costs and benefits to doing so inside an rrsp hopefully though i 've helped you understand the questions you should be asking yourself

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

i 'm not sure if this answer is going to win me many friends on reddit but here goes   there 's no good reason why they could n't have just told him the current balance shown on their records but   there are some good reasons why they ca n't quote a definitive payoff balance to instantly settle the account   it 's very possible to charge something today and not have it show up on chase 's records until tomorrow or monday or later there are still places that process paper credit card transactions or that deal with 3rd party payment processors who reconcile transactions m f 9 and so on    most transactions these days are authorized the instant you swipe the card and the merchant wo n't process until they get authorization back from the cc company but sometimes those authorizations come from third party processors who do n't bill chase until later some of them might not process a friday afternoon transaction until close of business monday    also there are things like fares that might be collected when you exit the cab but the record exists only in the taxi 's onboard machine until they plug it into something else at the end of the shift    there are still some situations outdoor flea markets auctions etc where the merchant takes a paper imprint and does n't actually process the payment until they physically mail it in or whatever    some small businesses have information security routines in place where only one person is allowed to process credit card payments but where multiple customer service reps are allowed to accept the cc info write it down on one piece of paper then either physically hand the paper to the person with processing rights or deposit the paper in a locked office or mail slot for later processing this is obviously not an instant update system for chase believe it or not this system is actually considered to be more secure than retaining computerized records unless the business has very rigorous end to end info security    so there are a bunch of legit reasons why a cc company ca n't necessarily tell you this instant that you only need to pay $ x and no more to close the account although there is no good reason why they should n't be able to quote your current balance    what happens when you close an account is basically that they stop accepting new charges that were made after your notification but they will still accept and bill you for legit charges that you incurred before you gave them notice so basically they turn off the credit card but they ca n't guarantee how much you owe until the next billing cycle after this one closes   you notify them to close the account they stop authorizing new charges    their merchant agreements basically give the merchant a certain window to process charges the cc company process legit charges that were made prior to closing the account    the cc company sends you the final statement after that window for any charges has expired   when that final statement is paid or if it is zero that is when the account is settled and reported to equifax etc as paid    so it 's hard to tell from your post who was being overly semantic unreasonable if the cc company refused to tell the current balance they were just being but if they refused to promise that the current balance shown is enough to instantly settle the account forever they had legit reasons   hope that helps

i did some empirical research comparing the exchange rates for wire transfers vs. the exchange rates for atm withdrawals with my bank wire transfers typically take a 4 float off the exchange rate atm withdrawals seem to take just over 2 and atm withdrawals do n't have a wire transfer fee as long as i 'm withdrawing from a branch of the same bank overseas the only problem with atm withdrawals is the daily limit as far as i can see 's answer above has it completely backwards at least with my bank atm withdrawals are a much better value do the research yourself call the bank you 're going to transfer from and find out what their current exchange rate is compare it to the current spot rate e.g. xe.com to determine how much of a cut the bank is taking then if you can withdraw some cash from the foreign location with your atm card and see how much of the original currency is deducted from your account in this way you can empirically discover for yourself the better rate

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

no the more conservative approach is to use the market value of debt at least assuming its trading at a discount a company would n't necessarily have to come to an agreement with creditors they would just default on their obligations in which case the company may file for bankruptcy protection which allows for a variety of scenarios to play out both consensual and not    as for when debt trades at a premium we 're talking about two different factors that effect bond prices credit risk and interest rate risk but yes a company does have a higher financial obligation if interest rates decline they 're stuck paying 8 in an environment where they could refinance for 6 if they refinance then creditors more than likely are n't going to take less than par if they do n't refinance then they have the opportunity cost of essentially overpaying on their cost of debt

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

it might not make sense but sugar most readily goes into our stores in the muscles and have low efficiency to fat conversion de novo   carbs alone do not contribute significantly to body fat     gt;most experimental data in humans however contradict this view of the function of de novo initial studies in which indirect was used showed little or no net de novo after short term 1 subsequent studies confirmed the absence of quantitatively significant through de novo under most conditions of energy surplus      de novo increases after with and to the same extent in lean and obese women but does not contribute greatly to total fat balance   now if you 're eating all the time you will hardly burn off the fat you do have and consume all the time   also a potato has 1 of it 's calories from fat and 8 and potato chips will have 50   this is the problem   natural carbs therefore are not the problem   processed food is

de beers is the company most cited as the near monopoly they used to own a massive chunk of the diamond supply and intentionally restricted that supply to increase the price in recent decades new sources of diamonds have reduced the de beers singular grip they still have a large share though video about this from adam ruins everything it turns out this ancient tradition of giving diamonds rings for engagements was invented less than a century ago by the de beers diamond corporation in 1938 the de beers diamond cartel launched a massive ad campaign claiming that the only way for a real man to show his love is with an expensive of carbon and we bought that shit it continues the only reason diamonds are even expensive is that de beers has a global monopoly on diamond mining and they artificially restrict the supply to jack the prices up because of this artificial supply restriction the resale value of diamonds are quite low

if you know that your tax situation is not easily handled by the standard withholding table then you can use that line to ask for additional funds be withheld you could also ask for less money to be withheld    why would somebody do this they had a small side business that made them extra income and wanted to withhold extra money from their full time job to cover the extra income they might have been awarded a big bonus and it caused too much in taxes to be withheld so they wanted to not have as much taxes from their regular pay check given the fact that you are young in your first real job and almost the entire tax year ahead of you it is likely that the standard tax tables will be close enough so leave the line blank or put zero

simply put the government has no balls to fight corruption   ideally the government would have enough people to oversee and make sure corruption like this does n't happen but the politicians cut a lot of money out for this type of enforcement primarily because they had money donated to them by these same businesses this looks great for the politician as it looks like they 're cutting government fat let 's say something like a hundred million dollars these fleece these companies and when they go under they plead and beg the government to bail them out or else they 'll have to fire all these people and it 'll kill the economy so the government steps in and bails out these companies for a few billion now they look like they are being proactive and saving the economy   all at the expense of you of course it 's too bad politicians do n't do what they believe is best but do what their donors believe is best for themselves

to get rich in a short time it 's more likely what you want to do is go into business you could go into a non investment business such as opening a restaurant or starting a tech company of course warren buffett was working in investing which is quite a bit different than just buying stocks the three ways to get rich investing i can think of are i think the maximum real after inflation return you can really count on over a lot of years is in the 5 6 range at most maybe less here 's a post where david argues 3 4 assuming cash interest is close to zero real return at that rate you can double every 10 15 years   any higher rate is probably risking much lower returns i often post this argument against that on investment questions http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ agree with you that lots of people seem to think they can make up for not saving money by picking a winning investment lots of people also use the lottery as a retirement strategy i 'm not sure this is totally irrational if for some reason someone just ca n't save but i 'm sure it will fail for almost all the people who try it

if you 're simply trading with your own money and have not incorporated then you are not eligible for a solo 401(k   nerdwallet has an excellent q&a on the topic here for example   solo 401(k is only allowed to be funded with earned income and capital gains are not earned income from the irs page on one participant 401(k plans elective deferrals up to 100 of compensation earned income in the case of a self employed individual up to the annual contribution limit earned income is defined by the irs here but not including even more clearly that page notes there are two ways to get earned income you work for someone who pays you or you own or run a business or farm capital gains are certainly neither of these now i have read several articles suggesting one way to go about using the solo 401k   all of them suggest that you would need to incorporate in some fashion that would require a schedule c tax return though and be trading with the company 's money rather than your own and then pay yourself a wage from that   in that case you would be eligible for a solo 401(k and you might even be better off as a result of all that even though you 'll be taxed at a higher rate for any income you do keep likely and have to pay self employment tax

a very interesting topic as i am moving to the us in a month i realise this thread is old but its been helpful to me   my observations from my home country   before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day who expect to work for a different person each day or week   well here a contractor would still be paid by a direct deposit even if he was working for many different people on the invoice the contractor provides bank account details and customer logs onto their internet banking and pays electronically it is a a very simple process and is the preferred method of payment by most businesses even small contractors many accounting software programs are linked to bank accounts and can quickly reconcile accounts for small business many businesses will not accept a cheque in australia anymore as they are considered to be a higher risk   i started work in 1994 and have never received any payment except via direct deposit

this sounds like an accounting nightmare to be 100 precise   with each payment you 're going to have to track if you can account for those then the fair thing to do is for one person to stop paying after they have paid the amount of principal they had at the beginning of the process or possibly after they have paid an amount equivalent to the total principal and accrued interest they would have paid if they paid their loans individually    the problem is one of you is likely going to pay more interest than you would have under the individual plan   in the example you gave if your brother pays off any of your loans he is going to be paying more in interest than if he paid on his 5 loans if you pay the highest rate loans first whoever has the lower total balance is going to pay more interest since they 'll be paying on the higher rates until they 've paid their fair share    i do n't see a clean way for you to up the interest savings appropriately unless you at the very end of the process    math aside these types of agreements can be dangerous to relationships what if one of you decides that they do n't want to participate anymore what if one of you gets all of their loans paid off much earlier they get the joy of being debt free while the other still has all of the debt left what if they then do n't feel to pay the other 's remaining debt are you both equally committed to cutting lifestyle in order to attack these debts in my opinion the complexity and risk to the relationship do n't justify the interest savings

in general investors with a long period of time until they would need to withdraw the cash are best off holding mostly equities   while the dividends that equities would return are less than the interest you would get in peer to peer lending over long periods of time not only do you get the dividends from equity investment but the value of the stock will grow faster than   interest on loans the higher returns from stocks however comes with more risk of big downturns   many people pull their investments out of stocks right after crashes which really hurts their long term returns   so in order to get the benefit of investing in stocks you need to be strong enough to continue to hold the stocks through the crash and into the recovery as for which stocks to invest in generally it is best to invest in low fee index funds etfs where you own a broad collection of stocks so that if when any one stock goes bust that your portfolio does not take much damage   try to own both international and domestic stocks to get good diversification   the consensus recommends adding just a little bit of reits and bonds to your investments but for someone at 25 it might not be worth it yet warren buffett had some good thoughts on index investing

it seems like it could be used for the reason stated but it 's hard to escape a more cynical reaction   if you have a work station and it 's assigned to somebody then you can conclude that it 's in use unless that person is not working the only way to get new information is by applying these to a series of work stations to determine if you have more or less of these than you need   this just seems like another step towards treating employees more and more like prisoners

the best practices for this sort of thing in terms of electronics and such you 're always at risk for some busting in your door and grabbing your ipod or whatever thieves do n't really care about clothes they want items quickly converted to cash small electronics with resale value cash jewelry keeping things locked and having a dog are probably the best for that scenario more professional organized who rob houses during the day stake out a neighborhood and look for places where their presence wo n't be noticed if things are clean and consistent your neighbors police patrol etc are more likely to notice something awry and call the police that 's a risk factor for the pro thief who will more likely look for a target if you live in an area where there has been a spree or you are really worried about this get a basic centrally monitored alarm system if you 're not living a flashy lifestyle and are deliberately thinking about ways to look like you do n't have anything it is money well spent if you are living a flashy lifestyle unwanted attention comes with the territory in any case feeling safe at home is something you need to be able to do

before you decide on moving into trading whether you have experience or not you need to sort out a couple of questions how much do you really understand about the markets   how much money you have and what would be the maximum loss you may be able to take   what supporting eco system you have to help you in terms of trading i.e. hardware software research connections who can provide you with solid information and sorts of it are you really prepared to take on institutions who have billions to spend and take losses i.e. amounts which might break you will be peanuts for them i am assuming you are in us so this website   may help you a bit trading websites where you can open an account   even if you reply in affirmative to the above questions you should still be wary about making money by trading it is a field where even the best people have been in the face without any mercy and above all do n't expect any person will take mercy on your hard earned cash they will take you to the cleaners if they have to there are some websites which allow you to participate in trading not involving real money try that out and see where you get to that should give you some pointers on where you are headed   and realize that it is human nature to assume when you hear news that such and such trader make loads of money in such and such trades trading is easy unless you do it for yourself the truth is such traders would be on their desk for 18 20 hours at a stretch 6 7 days a week without a life to make such money and they have loads of support staff i.e. analysts it guys who makes it easier for them do you have such help if no then look the other side   but giving up without trying at all will be but do it in limits which you can bear and not to get carried away when things are good

your bank will gladly help you convert your indian savings accounts into nro savings accounts you can not change these accounts into nre accounts directly nre accounts are supposed to be funded via deposits made from foreign currency accounts under the liberalized schemes available now you can transfer the money in your regular savings account into your account abroad converting it into foreign currency if you and your ca provide proof to your bank and the reserve bank of india that you have paid all applicable taxes on the money in your savings account and then you can transfer it all back into your nre account perhaps you can combine these two steps into a single one thereby putting the money in your regular savings account into an nre account in one step but i am sure that there will be lots of fees involved e.g. you might get by commissions as well as the exchange rate differential as if you converted indian rupees to us dollars say and then converted the dollars back to rupees just as if you did the two step conversion there are no taxes involved in moving your own money into different accounts but there can be lots of fees and service charges

for the specific example you gave a cd with a 0.05 rate of return i 'd shop around some more that 's a very low rate of return a more realistic one would be 0.5 depending on the terms as has been mentioned cds are good when you need to preserve your capital what might be a situation for that they are great for emergency funds which you should always have a reasonable amount of cash in i have a set up 3 cds with 12 month terms each carrying about 30 of my emergency savings the remaining 10 i keep in a standard savings account for quick access dealing with a short term emergency the 3 are spaced about 4 months apart so that i 'm always within 4 months of having one come to term they have a 3 month penalty if i withdraw early but based on the fact that i have never had to touch more than 10 of my emergency savings i 'm perfectly okay with that what about more long term savings well it depends on what your timeframe is for using the money if it 's more than 10 years and you are willing to risk losing some of it then by all means invest in a higher risk higher reward investment if it 's only a few years maybe a bond fund is something that would be better and if you really need to preserve the money then a cd can be great too

for anyone who 'd like to know a little more   basically i 'm curious about newer styles of portfolio optimization we all know and love the classic markowitz mean variance optimization model gather your assets optimize weights based on minimizing variance and maximizing return plot your capital allocation line find your sharpe ratio portfolio   in case anyone does n't know what i 'm talking about check this out it is a very common technique still used quite widely terms e   however the markowitz model makes a couple of huge assumptions one of them being that asset returns roughly follow a normal distribution since this is not always the case new models for risk management and optimization have emerged starting with value at risk and more recently conditional value at risk terms c   you can also draw an efficient frontier for portfolios using fairly complicated linear programming techniques as first outlined in this very influential fortunately these days the techniques are widely available in python and matlab packages    for further discussion what are your thoughts on the markowitz model do you have a preferred portfolio optimization method

unfortunately i believe there is not a good answer to this because it 's not a well posed problem   it sounds like you are looking for a theoretically sound criteria to decide whether to sell or hold   such a criteria would take the form of calculating the cost of continuing to hold a stock and comparing it to the transactions cost of replacing it in your portfolio however your criteria for stock selection does n't take this form   you appear to have some ad hoc rules defining whether you want the stock in your portfolio that provide no way to calculate a cost of having something in your portfolio you do n't want or failing to have something you do want   criteria for optimally rebalancing a portfolio ca n't really be more quantitative than the rules that define the portfolio

there are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate in addition to your standard deduction you also have a personal exemption of $ 4050   so d in your calculation should be $ 6300 + $ 4050 = $ 10,350 as a self employed individual you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the social security and medicare taxes   instead of 6.2 + 1.45 you need to pay 6.2 + 1.45 2 = 15.3 self employment tax in addition there are some problems with your calculation quarter 1 estimated income should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4 not 3 likewise you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year then dividing by 4   so annual estimated federal tax should be quarterly estimated federal tax would be = 4 annual estimated self employment tax is = 15.3 a with the quarterly self employment tax being one fourth of that = 4 self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax   so when you send in your quarterly payment using form 1040-es you should send in + the form 1040-es instructions pdf comes with the 2016 estimated tax worksheet that walks you through these calculations

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

concise answers to your questions depends on the loan and the bank when you accelerate repayment of a loan by applying a pre payment balance to the principal your monthly payment may be reduced however standard practice for most loan types is that the repayment schedule will be accelerated you 'll pay no less each month but you 'll pay it off sooner i can neither confirm nor deny that an internship counts as job experience in the field for the purpose of mortgage lending it sounds logical especially if it were a paid internship in which case you 'd just call it a job but i ca n't be sure as i do n't know of anyone who got a mortgage without accruing the necessary job experience post graduation a loan officer will be happy to talk to you and answer specific questions but if you go in today with no credit history the student loan probably has n't even entered repayment and a lot of unknowns an offer can be for instance you are virtually certain to be denied a mortgage the bank is going to want evidence that you will make good on the debt you have over time one $ 10,000 payment on the loan though significant is just one payment as far as your credit history and credit score is concerned now a few more reality checks $ 70k yr is not what you 'll be bringing home as a single person without dependents you 'll be taxed at the highest possible withholdings rate your effective tax rate on $ 70k depending on the state in which you live can be as high as 30 including all payroll ss taxes for a 1099 earner and/or an employee in a state with an income tax so you 're actually only bringing home 42k yr or about $ if you 're paid biweekly to that add a decent chunk for your group healthcare plan which as of 2014 you will be required to buy or else pay another $ 2500 effectively another 3 of gross earnings in taxes and even now with your first job you should be at least trying to save up a decent chunk o change in a 401k or ira as a retirement nest egg that student loan beginning about 6 months after you leave school will cost you about $ in monthly payments for the next 10 years if it 's all stafford loans with a 50/50 split between sub that could be as much as $ for all stafford or $ 700 or more for private loans if you were going to pay all that back in two years you 're looking at paying a ballpark of $ leaving just $ 700 to pay all your bills and expenses each month with a 3-year payoff plan you 're turning around one of your two paychecks every month to the student loan servicer which for a bachelor is doable but still rather tight your mortgage payment is n't the only payment you will make on your house if you get an fha loan with 3.5 down the lender will demand pmi the city county will likely levy a property tax on the assessed value of land and building the lender may require that you purchase home insurance with minimum acceptable coverage limits and deductibles all of these will be paid into escrow accounts managed by your lending bank from a single check you send them monthly i pay all of these in a state texas that gets its primary income from sales and property tax instead of income and my monthly payment is n't quite double the simple once you have the house you 'll want to fill the house nice bed probably $ 1500 between mattress and frame for a nice big queen you can stretch out on and have lady friends over nice couch $ 1000 tv call it $ 500 that 's probably the bare minimum you 'll want to buy to replace what you lived through college with you 'll have somewhere to eat and sleep other than the floor of your new home and we 're already talking almost a month 's salary or payments of up to 10 of your monthly take home pay over a year on a couple of store credit cards plates etc just keeps bumping this up yes they 're theoretically all one time costs but they 're things you need and things you may not have if you 've been living in dorms and eating in dining halls all through college the house you buy now is likely to be a starter maybe and 1600 sqft at the upper end they sell em as small as it will support a spouse and 2 kids but by that point you 'll be bursting at the what happens if your future spouse had the same idea of buying a house early while rates were low the cost of buying a house may be as little as 3.5 down and a few hundred more in advance escrow and a couple other fees the seller ca n't pay for you the cost of selling the same house is likely to include all the costs you made the seller pay when you bought it because you 'll be selling to someone in the same position you 're in now i did n't know it at the time i bought my house but i paid about $ 5,000 to get into it 3.5 down and 6 months escrow up front while the sellers paid over $ 10,000 to get out the owner got married to another homeowner and they ended up selling both houses to move out of town i do n't even know what kind of bath they took on the house we were n't involved with i graduated in 2005 i did n't buy my first house until i was married and pretty much well settled in 2011 and yes we were looking because mortgage rates were at rock bottom we really lucked out in terms of a home that if we want to or have to we can live in for the rest of our lives only but it 's officially a with a spare room and a downstairs master suite and nursery office so when we 're old and we can pretty much live downstairs i would seriously recommend that you do the same even if by doing so you miss out on the absolute best interest rates last example let 's say hypothetically that you bite at current interest rates and lock in a rate just above prime at 4 3.5 down seller pays closing but then in two years you get married change jobs and have to move let 's further suppose an alternate reality in which after two years of living in an apartment all the same life changes happen and you are now shopping for your first house having been pre approved at 5 that one percentage point savings by buying now on a house in the $ 200k range is worth about $ or about $ off of your p&i payment $ on a $ 200,000 home with a 30-year term not chump change over 30 years if you had been that lucky it 's $ but it 's less than 5 of your take home pay month to month or annually however when you move in two years the buyer 's probably going to want the same deal you got seller pays closing because that 's the market level you bought in to low priced starters for first time homebuyers that 's a 3 commission for both agents 1 origination guarantor and various fixed fees title etc assuming the value of the house has n't changed let 's call total selling costs 8 of the house value of $ 200k which is probably low that 's $ 16,000 in seller 's costs again assuming home value did n't change and that you got an fha loan requiring only 3.5 down your down payment $ 7k plus principal paid about another $ 7k to be exact only covers $ 14k of those costs you 're now in the hole $ 2,000 and you still have to come up with your next home 's down payment   with all other things being equal in order to get back to where you were in net worth terms before you bought the house meaning $ 7,000 cash in the bank after selling it you would need to stay in the house for 4 and a half years to accumulate the $ 16,000 in equity through principal payments that leaves you with your original $ 7,000 down payment returned to you in cash and you 're even in accounting terms which means in finance terms you 're behind that $ 7,000 invested at 3 historical average rate of inflation would have earned you about $ 800 in those four years meaning you need to stick around about 5.5 years before you break even in tvm terms for this reason i would say that you should be very cautious when buying your first home it may very well be the last one you 'll ever buy whether that 's because you made good choices or bad is up to you

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

assuming in the us there are several possibilities but to be honest anyone here is only going to be able to make guesses   to get the answer the account holder your girlfriend is going to have to contact the bank and ask them directly       some possibilities include   suspicion of money laundering suspicion of possible illegal activities in the account e.g. check kiting suspicion of possible prohibited activities not necessarily illegal but as defined in the account agreement they may not allow activity related to gambling or businesses for example suspicion of business activity taking place in a non business account insufficient kyc know your customer information on the account such as they did not or could not verify required information during the account opening process a negative chexsystems report for example they found out through chexsystems she had derogatory information reported on another account at another bank previously or extended period of time it was usually 30 + days     i should also add that any bank credit union has just as much a right to close an account with a customer as the customer has the right to close their account with the bank credit union at any time without notice       in most cases although not all when a bank closes an account they will send a letter to the address on file for the account beforehand explaining the reasons   have her check her mail       are you sure the account is actually closed and not just blocked    it could just be in a blocked status due to overdraft or some other reason which is very different from being closed       as for where the direct deposit went if the account is truly closed then the money is being returned back to the company that initiated the direct deposit usually takes 2 3 business days   your girlfriend will have to contact the company 's payroll department to arrange other means of payment such as a check       in any case it 's all speculation at this point until the bank can be contacted to find out the real reason why   tip for the future   look at switching to a bank that has 24/7 customer service

quote driven markets are the to the modern securities market before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and onerous   today the average investor can open up a web page type in a security and buy at the spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation   a market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias exposure to the direction of the security and commence to making the market   the market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume   if volumes were high the spread would be low and vice versa market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue to maintain no directional bias   in other words if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers hitting the market maker 's ask the mm would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis   eventually a seller would arise and hit the mm 's bid bringing the market maker 's inventory back into balance and narrowing the spread that particular mm could provide since a responsible mm 's ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly   this was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to market makers prefer to profit from the spread bidding below some predetermined price based upon the cost basis of the market maker 's inventory while asking above that same predetermined cost basis   traders profit from taking exposure to a security 's direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders because of electronic trading liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits and algorithms that become better by the day market making hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker and there are many hfts where there previously were few official market makers   this speed and diversification of risk across many many market making hfts have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges orders and quotes are essentially identical   both are double sided auction markets with bids and asks   the difference lies in that non market makers specialists etc orders are not shown to the rest of the market providing an informational advantage to mms and an informational disadvantage to the trader   before electronic trading this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent   with the prevalence of hfts the informational disadvantage has become more costly so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen the worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other so all trades had to go between a market maker specialist etc   while this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a mm et al paying more than what another trader was willing to sell these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade so the costs were infinite in essence a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders   while necessary in the days where paper receipts were from brokerage to brokerage and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading it has no place in a computerized market   it is more costly to the trader to use such a market explaining quote driven markets rapid exit

buying now with a mortgage gets you waiting to buy with all cash gets you these are also some of the pros or cons for the rent or buy dilemma that paul mentioned in comments to the op this is a very complex multi question that would not respond well to being put into any equation or financial model most people answer the question with buy the home now with a mortgage if they can pay for the down payment this is why the mortgage industry exists the people who would want to finance now rather than buy with all cash later would not only be analyzing the question in terms of financial health but also in terms of general well being they might consider the tremendous pride that comes with home ownership and living under a roof of one 's own who can say that those people are wrong

i do n't know any clever way to do what you 're describing   and in a sense you can see why there might not be one   a mortgage is n't just a magical way to reduce your housing expenses it 's a tradeoff in which you agree to a long term commitment in exchange for fixed costs or at least costs with a structure over that long term   if you 're unwilling to accept the obligation of paying for and maintaining the property over a long period you ca n't really expect to reap the benefits of lowered costs   part of the reason people say buying is better is because people often do live in the same place for a long time in which case if they rent they might miss out on savings they could have had if they bought instead   if you 're not going to live in the same place for a long time buying may not actually be better for you

one of the reasons apart from historical is that different people have different tax liabilities which the employer may not be aware of for example in the us we do n't pay taxes in source on investment income and there are many credits and deductions that we ca n't take so if i have a child and some interest income from my savings account employer 's withholding will not match my actual tax liability there are credits for children additional taxes for the interest and the actual tax brackets vary based on my marital status and filing options i chose so even the same family of two people married will pay different amounts in taxes if they chose to file separate tax returns for each than if they chose to file jointly on one tax return for anyone who 've lived anywhere else like you and me this system is ridiculously complex and inefficient but for americans that works mainly for the reason of not knowing anything better and more importantly not wanting to know

peace of mind is the key to your question just before the us housing bust of 2007 i had someone try to convince me to take all the equity from my house which was overvalued in an overheated market the idea was to put that money in the stock market for a bigger return than the interest on the house many people did that and found themselves out of jobs as the economy crashed unfortunately they could n't sell their homes because they owed more than they were worth i never lost a night of sleep over the money i did n't make in the stock market i did manage to trade up to a house twice the size by buying another when the housing market bottomed out but waiting for a market recovery to sell the smaller house the outcome of my good fortune is a very nice house with no mortgage worth about 1/3 of my total net worth that 's probably a larger percentage than most money managers would recommend but it is steadily decreasing because now all the money that would go to a mortgage payment instead gets deposited in retirement accounts and it still has 30 years to grow before i start drawing it down i almost do n't remember the burden of a mortgage hanging over my head each month almost

with 1 it 's rather confusing as to where interest refers to what you 're paying and where it refers to what you 're being paid and it 's confusing what you expect the numbers to work out to be if you have to pay normal interest on top of sharing the interest you receive then you 're losing money if the lending bank is receiving less interest than the going market rate then they 're losing money if the bank you 've deposited the money with is paying more than the going market rate they 're losing money i do n't see how you imagine a scenario where someone is n't losing money for 2 and 3 you 're buying stocks on margin which certainly is something that happens but you 'll have to get an account that is specifically for margin trading it 's a specific type of credit with specific rules and you if you want to engage in this sort of trading you should go through established channels rather than trying to convert a regular loan into margin trading if you get a personal loan that is n't specifically for margin trading and buy stocks with the money and the stocks tank you can be in serious trouble if you do it through margin trading it 's still very risky but not nearly as risky as trying to game the system in some cases doing this makes you not only but criminally liable the lending bank absolutely can lose if your stocks tank since then there will be nothing backing up the loan

it depends primarily on how the canadian economy is designed i.e export oriented or import oriented if you look at this it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports for the specific case of canada the exports would become costlier because of a costlier dollar but at the same time imports would become cheaper this is only a generalization not specific which would require a more detailed but investors have a different dilemma canadian investors would find   it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in canada while foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in canada and may wait for later or invest else   then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of canada but what would be the final outcome of the whole is little difficult to predict because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do but the basic gist is canadian exporters will be sad and canadian importers will be happy but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in canada

you seem to be from your original point   energy is built into consumer products for the most part the transportation portion to market of it is negligible the plastics cost is virtually nothing today so i 'm not sure the point you 're driving at   your first point seemed to be that reducing energy costs would be a direct benefit to the average civilian which despite the fact that consumerism is somewhat rampant in the usa it 's pretty clear that if people can not afford to buy consumer items they pull back and focus only on the necessities   so i 'm not sure what your point is   or how you arrived to it   or if you 're just trying to support your original statement rather than accepting that maybe it was in error     you stated that cheaper energy will help to solve income inequality   you 've given some reasons but i do n't think any of them really support your statement   income inequality will not be solved by consumers being able to buy cheaper goods you can not infinitely reduce the price of goods until it matches the poorest 's wages that does n't solve the problem but rather just it further   the goods are now cheaper for the super rich who are now considered wealthier

i do n't know how much finance you know but a fundamental idea is that something 's value is the present value of all its future cash flows basically what those cash flows are worth today so if we can predict the cash flows the equity holders will get in the future not easy and determine at what rate to discount the cash flows not easy we can value the equity    so a company will have cash flows coming in but not all go to the equity holders some will go to debt holders if any interest payments some will go to preferred equity holders dividends if any what 's left over is what the equity holders will get if there 's no debt preferred equity or other things like that then the equity holders get all the cash flows   this does n't mean the equity holders literally receive the cash they 'll get whatever is given out via dividends but they own the cash and it may be reinvested in the business to generate more cash in the future

typically there are three ways an acquisition is financed what is used is called the consideration   1 cash existing cash on the balance sheet is used think of it like purchasing something with your debit card   2 stock this a bit more complicated the acquiring company issues new shares and exchanges those shares for shares of the because new shares are issued this can have a effect on the stock price of the acquirer however it can have an accretive effect if enough value between the two companies is realized and/or expected   3 debt basically like taking out a loan    the consideration for a deal is often reported as you read in your article   most deals are a combination of cash stock debt debt is often referred to as cash i.e. if you take out a loan you are essentially receiving cash     when it comes to which is best to use there are quantitative analyses for that with a specific focus on the acquirer 's eps earnings per share post deal   the factors that are considered are the forgone interest on cash the additional interest gained from taking on debt and the effects of issuing new stock there is no right answer for which is best as there are multiple different factors and circumstances involved across m&amp;a deals each company has different borrowing rates and value expected from their deals one big factor is the timing and stock price of both companies during the deal if the acquirer is trading at an all time high and the is at an all time low then perhaps an all stock deal would be advantageous to the buyer    typically companies want to avoid stock deals because they are the most

well futures do n't have a strike like an option the price represents how much you 're obligated to buy sell the index for at a specified date in the future   you are correct that there 's no cost to enter a contract though there may be broker fees and margin payments   any difference between the contract price and the price of the index at settlement is what is exchanged at settlement    it 's analogous to the bid ask on a stock the bid price represents the price at which someone is willing to buy a futures contract meaning enter into a long position and the ask is how much someone is willing to sell a contract so if you want to take a long position on s&p500 mini futures you 'd have to enter in at the ask price   if the index is above your contract price on the future expiry date you 'll make a profit if it is below the contract price you 'll take a loss

i dislike shopping for some stuff from amazon because they actually suck at a lot of key e commerce things   their search is pretty bad for some stuff   computer parts for example   the pricing shipping here are 82 sellers some of which count towards the buy $ 25 and get free postage and some that do n't   this is especially bad for things like books where used is just as good in most cases   free shipping   you have massive warehouses in my home town   you can ship any of these items same day if i pay 12 bucks for the privilege   do n't tell me you ca n't get it to me in less than 10 days if i select free shipping   the constant are you really really really sure you do n't want prime   seeming random pricing   i like and it 's worthwhile to order 3 or 4 volumes at a time to get to the free shipping tier   but you 'll have volume 11 $ 9.75 volume 12 $ volume 13 $ 9.75   other vendors comes to mind seem to at least have consistent across the board pricing and discounts

property taxes where they exist are generally levied by cities counties and other local level administrative bodies like and are the primary source of revenue at these levels of government these taxes pay the lion 's share of the expenses for basic services provided by a city or county there are federal dollars other revenue sources state lottery revenues often go toward public schools for instance and usage fees vehicle registration utility bills toll roads at play as well but a lot of that money covers larger scale infrastructure development freeways and specialized political involving this bridge or that dam in a 's home district a few national initiatives from the president 's budget like first technology upgrades for improved disaster terrorism property taxes are the main funding for the day to day government operations at the most visible level to the average resident the theory behind using a property tax instead of some other form of taxation like income is that the value of the property and the quality of services provided to the of that property are the property is valuable in part because the infrastructure is well maintained and nearby schools hospitals are good and by the same token affluent residents expect high quality services property taxes are also easier to levy because most of the work can be done by the tax assessor monitor recent sale prices do drive through neighborhoods come up with a number and send the resident the bill that 's opposed to sales taxes which businesses operating in the jurisdiction have to calculate collect and turn over or income taxes which require residents to fill out paperwork to calculate how much they owe the justification is eminent domain it 's very simple when you buy land in the u.s. and a state thereof you are still a citizen and/or resident of that state and the u.s. and subject to their laws you 're not creating your own country when you buy a house as such the government charges you for the facilities and services they provide in your area and your state which are then your privilege to use obviously roads are n't free a one mile stretch behind my house is costing the county $ 15 million to expand it from to here 's the kicker you 've already been paying these taxes you think your landlord 's just going to take the property taxes for the whole apartment complex on the chin he 's out to make money and doing that requires charging a sufficient amount to cover costs including taxes he incurs you just never see allocated property taxes as an item on your rent statement just like you do n't see allocated mortgage allocated facilities maintenance allocated gross margin etc you know you 're getting shafted paying someone else 's financing with a little extra on the side to boot that 's why you want a house unfortunately not being able to pay these taxes is a reality for some people old and young and government generally does n't go easy on delinquent homeowners after medical bills and mortgage delinquency property tax delinquency is the number three reason for bankruptcy and only a mortgage or property tax delinquency can cause your home to be seized and sold well that and using it for criminal enterprise but unless you 're running a meth lab in your half million dollar home or financing it with coke money i would n't worry about that score retirement planners figure property taxes into cost of living and they do often advise a downgrade from the house you raised your children in to something smaller for many reasons including lower taxes there really is n't a way to structure a completely pay as you go metropolitan area and you would n't want to live in it if there were imagine every strip of asphalt in the county being a toll road where your ez pass etc or license plate was scanned and you were billed at each intersection in addition to being a huge invasion of privacy the cost to maintain this network and your cost to use it would skyrocket imagine 911 asking for a credit card number before police fire or ems ambulance services already do bill on a per event basis but you 'd be surprised how few people pay and how little power a county ems has to enforce collection without a property tax and medicaid to cover the difference ems service could not be provided in most counties

i have been in a very similar place like that before as an intern and got the hell out quickly   let me try to paint a picture   on the 12th floor of a random nyc building there will be a large office floor with long desks in several rows   around the outside against the windows will be maybe some empty conference rooms random senior people you wo n't be allowed to talk to and a poor miserable compliance guy stuck in a somewhere   each desk will have a phone and a call sheet   there wo nt be many computers anywhere maybe one bloomberg machine in the back   every single person in there is on the phone   in fact that will be your job   starting at sharp you will be at your desk   at 8 you will start dialing the call sheet put on your desk   if it is a bunch of residences you will get angry house wives because their husbands are at work do nt pitch the bitch next call you will get someone that passed away 2 years ago mark your sheet dead and cross out as you are dialing the next number   if you manage to get someone that answers their own phone at work and listens to a pitch you will now get the opportunity to give a pitch on why a mid market dividend paying stock is fantastic and should be bought now   now as in you have to open a brokerage account on the first call for no less than a $ 5k trade   you will pitch them on why they do nt need to ask their wife why you will bring them great ideas   ask them what is their net worth have they ever hired a broker over the phone qualify them or get hung up on   anything short of them threatening to call the sec and you before hanging up means you will be sure to call them again a prospect actually picking up the phone is about a 1 in 20 dial event   people just slamming the phones on you call them back for fun because you got disconnected     if you ever manage to get a client you will be charging them enormous percentages and fees to do simple trades but do nt worry you probably wo nt get a client in the first 2 months and even if you manage to get clients it will be maybe one or two a month   think about the sheer volume of calls you have to make 300 400 calls a day is probably a normal pace    you will meet the most insane people   people will go down for lunch or coffee and never return to the office   most of the people there you wonder how they ever passed a series 7   there are people that fail the 7 3 times and quit   there will be a guy that opens 10 accounts a month and actually will be talking with two phones up to his ears at once           this is the definition of a high pressure sales job

well these can range from loan broker to outright scams it is pretty typical that loan broker just take some fee in the middle for their service of filling your applications for a bunch of real loan provider companies because making a web page costs nothing a single loan broker could easily have many web pages with a bit different marketing so that they can get as many customers as possible but of course some of the web pages can be actual scams as soon as you provide enough information for taking out a loan they can go to a real financial institution take out the loan and run with the money in most countries consumer protection laws do not apply to business to business transactions so you have to be even more wary of scams than usual

careful   i would personally need a lot more than $ 5 more per hour to go from w-2 employment to 1099 employment   it boils down to two reasons 1 employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees and 2 you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front your current proposal from them does n't account for that there are also risks that you face as a 1099   on the first item your employer currently pays 6.2 of your social security tax you pay the other 6.2 if you go to 1099 status you will be self employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4 out of your increased 1099 wages   on the second item your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form w-4 if you 're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck great many people are n't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year   overall there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits these will not be available to you as a 1099 employee you can also be terminated unless you have a specific contract length with the company   as i see it not including any benefits you would receive you 're looking at less money in your pocket at $ as a contractor than at your $ your pay net social security deductions is $ 48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = = as a 1099 $ you would net $ 50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = =   then there are the rest of taxes etc to figure out your real take home pay   i 'm not a tax advisor but i would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping i would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent too

no i 'd prefer a healthcare environment where prices are so reasonable you do n't need outlandish insurance and trillion dollar government programs   but no the government refuses to negotiate why because the almost all healthcare legislation is created to enrich the industry itself obamacare is nice in theory but what it really does is give the insurance industry 30 million new customers without so much as a token discount medicare has a provision that specifically prohibits negotiation of prices on drugs    so you tell me should the role of the government be to enrich the companies by feeding them more customers err i mean enrolling more citizens or should the role of government be to keep regulation in check to where it does n't cost $ 80 for a single pair of gloves

a good way to measure the performance of your investments is over the long term 25 30 returns are easy to get it 's not going to be 25 30 in a single year though you should n't expect more than about 4 real inflation adjusted return per year on average over the long term unless you have reason to believe that you 're doing a better job of predicting the market than the intellectual and investment might of wall street which is possible but hard pro tip it 's actually quite easy to the market at large over the short term just by getting lucky or investing in risky in a good year earning this sort of return consistently over many years though is stupidly hard usually you 'll wipe out your gains several years into the process instead the stock market fluctuates like crazy which is why they tell you not to invest any money you 're likely to need sooner than about 5 years out and you switch your portfolio from stocks to bonds as you approach and enter retirement the traditional benchmark for comparison as others have mentioned is the rate of return including dividends from the standard and poors 500 index these are large stable companies which make up the core of larger united states business most people supplement these with some smaller companies and overseas companies as a part of the portfolio

in the case of regulated exchange traded options the writer of an options contract is obliged to maintain a margin with their broker and the broker is obliged to maintain a margin with the clearing house   institutional writers of options will deal directly with the clearing house in the event that the writer is unable to make a daily margin call the broker or clearing house may automatically close out all of their positions using existing margin held   if there was a shortfall the broker or clearing house would be left to the client writer to make good on their obligations none of this effects the position of the original buyer of the options contract   effectively the buyer 's counterparty is their broker 's clearing house account

i listen to and for whatever reason many artists post their mixes on soundcloud   so i use soundcloud   but holy shit is everything about it garbage   the app likes to close freeze or just refuse to play despite appearing to otherwise be functioning   the search is hot garbage   you ca n't really string together a play list at least not easily that we 've found   you can favorite things but i am constantly hunting through the list of new stuff looking for mixes amongst the 2 3 minute song   an add to playlist option would be really nice   soundcloud is hot garbage and them cutting 40 of their staff makes me immediately think that they fired only two people because it is hard to believe that more than five people could work at a place with such a shitty app

you are giving your parents a short term loan the value of that loan is likely far less than the gift tax exclusion for the year you only need to account for the money you loaned to them and the money they paid back this is not income for you unless they pay interest it is not a gift from them because they are just paying you back

wow all the answers here are a joke retained earnings is a funding side liabilities + equity of the balance sheet accounting entry it 's a residual value so if you end up funding your assets with more liabilities for example then retained earnings will be smaller   when worrying about the funding side of the balance sheet you should consider mainly 1 how much you want in the business of your own money equity and 2 how much debt your business can support as well as how much debt you 're comfortable with   2 is a function of looking at your income generating capacity once you 've figured out how much you will fund with debt you then need the remainder to be your money some of this is contributed capital the rest is retained earnings so to wonder about how much in retained earnings to have is n't really the way to think about it you should have the debt vs. equity conversation with yourself and figure it out that way do n't worry about the components of equity if you 're a sole owner and it 's all yours there are other ways to finance equity like preferred shares but for all intents and purposes this is a small business   from a risk perspective retained earnings is largely irrelevant on a standalone basis you should pay far more attention to your assets for example if you asked how much cash or working capital do i need that 's an operational question that 's very important to know for running the business it can be debated and there is a right answer retained earnings is just a partial accounting entry of equity and can even be manipulated by repurchasing shares and then contributing more capital so i would n't focus on it

dude i 'm a small business owner the fact of the matter is employee costs are a big expense but the truth is i think people that pay minimum wage are scum    if you 're so convinced that a livable wage would make it worse why do n't you standardize a companies 10-k and show me that the cost of the product will raise equal to the wage increase you ca n't because it wo n't the cost increase on margins is divided over every operating metric a company has and therefore the price wo n't increase at a 1:1 ratio    further the margins that are made by the companies employing the people making minimum wage are often from government assistance so you 're claiming it 's cheaper for the populace to create false net revenues by directing tax dollars to support the very people that ca n't buy food because of a $ 7 an hour wage    then you have the countless people stuck in the welfare hole of losing their benefits if they get a slightly better job that just knocks them out of the specified ranges required to qualify so you have people that want to work but now ca n't make too much money or it will make their life worse all because of the system that was created by a minimum wage that never matched inflation and cheap companies that rely on welfare systems to keep their employees happy a rough to keep living    companies that pay minimum wage are jokes

eh you hear this argument all the time but it does n't actually work out that way in the real world though because corporate pay structure is extremely malleable over time    if a company makes $ 100 m one year it will pay the investors what they 're expecting the low level employees what they 're willing to tolerate which is often the minimum wage and then the upper management whatever is left i.e. whatever the company can afford to attract the best management by bumping up the minimum wage the main effect is that it forces companies to change their pay structures which are currently ridiculous the u.s. ceo to avg worker pay is around japan and germany are around iirc   feel free to dig deeper into the numbers and the studies if you want further evidence but even a cursory glance at our history or the current situation in australia shows that the effects of a high minimum wage on both inflation and unemployment are largely overstated

the preferred accounts are designed to hope you do one of several things pay one day late   then charge you all the deferred interest many people think if they put $ x a month aside then pay just before the 6 months 12 or no payment before 2014 period ends then i will be able to afford the computer carpet or furniture the interest rate they will charge you if you are late will be buried in the fine print but expect it to be very high pay on time but now that you have a card with their logo on it   so now you feel that you should buy the accessories from them they hope that you become a long time customer they want to make money on your next computer also their bill me later option on that site as essentially the same as the preferred account in the end you will have another line of credit they will do a credit check the impact both positive and negative on your credit picture is discussed in other questions   because two of the three options you mentioned in your question cash debit card imply that you have enough cash to buy the computer today there is no reason to get another credit card to finance the purchase the delayed payment with the preferred account will save you about 10 dollars 2000 1 interest 0.5 years   the choice of store might save you more money though with apple there are fewer places to get legitimate discounts here are your options how to get the limit increased you can ask for a temporary increase in the credit limit or you can ask for a permanent one some credit cards can do this online others require you to talk to them if they are going to agree to this it can be done in a few minutes some individuals on this site have even been able to send the check to the credit card company before completing the purchase thus increasing their credit limit ymmv i have no idea if it works   a good reason to use the existing credit card instead of the debit card is if the credit card is a rewards card the extra money or points can be very nice just make sure you pay it back before the bill is due in fact you can send the money to the credit card company the same day the computer arrives in the mail   having the transaction on the credit card can also get you purchase protection and some cards automatically extend the warranty

thanks man even the credit default swaps were initially an amazing deal for the banks selling them they got to collect huge amounts of premium for awhile thinking they 'd never have to pay out for the stories we heard in the big short i bet there 's hundreds of people out there who paid premiums for years until they could n't anymore and never got their big payout        it 's crazy that you could basically take out an insurance policy on something you had no stake or equity in it was literally a bet the data supported the defaults too though looking at delinquency series q1 of 2010 had a staggering of all mortgage payments being late that 's insane some people saw it creeping up and recognized that q1 08 was 76 higher than the previous year and was only climbing and knew it was going to pop

pump and dump scams are indeed very real but the scale of a single scam is n't anywhere near the type of you see in movies like trading places usually the scammer will buy a few hundred dollars of a penny stock for some obscure small business then they 'll spam every address they have with advice that this business is about to announce a huge breakthrough that will make it the next microsoft a few dozen people bite buy up a few thousand shares each remember the shares are trading for pennies then when the rise in demand pushes up the price enough for the scammer to make a decent buck he cashes out the price falls based on the resulting glut of stock and the victims lose their money thus a few red flags shake out that would be investors should be wary of

the best way to get cash from retirement is to not do it   leave the retirement savings alone   start saving for house down payment   look for ways to squirrel away money for that down payment   consider payment plus insurance taxes and maintenance costs   if all that comes in less than a rental you 're probably better off buying   most likely it will not   make sure that when you go to buy you have 20 down and an emergency fund that will cover you for 3 months of expenses at the new higher rate   hint that 'll probably be in excess of 10k based on a single person with a 1.5 2k a month mortgage plus utilities and food   and as a home owner you will have a lot of things for which that emergency fund will come in handy   it 's a matter of when not if   consider 5k for a new roof 6k for a hvac system for exterior paint 500 for the plumber 750 for pest control 250 to have the tree removed that fell in a storm   1000 for a new fridge   500 for a new water heater   1200 for washer and dryer   all of these are periodic costs and they all able to fail before they 're supposed to

i would consult a tax professional for specific help   on my own research i believe that you could   i know that when i made payments when i was in school for my undergraduate i made payments on the interest   i believe that i was even told by my financial aid office that i could deduct the interest that i paid   i made not much money so i was n't anywhere close to the magi > 75k but i believe you still could    not only that but one other thing to consider is that if you have an loan the interest still accrues when you are in school   in that case it might be better to make at least some payments   it would save you from the total loan amount ballooning so much while you are in school

i think the issue you are having is that the option value is not a flow but rather a liability that changes value over time it is best to illustrate with a balance sheet the $ 33 dollars would be the premium net of expense that you would receive from your brokerage for having shorted the options this would be your asset the liability is the right for the option owner the person you sold it to to exercise and purchase stock at a fixed price at the moment you sold it the marked to market value of that option is $ 40 hence you are at a net account value of $ $ which is the commission over time as the price of that option changes the value of your account is simply $ 33 since each option contract is for 100 shares in your example above this implies that the option price is 20 cents so if i were to redo the chart it would look like this if the next day the option value goes to 21 cents your liability would now be = $ 42 dollars in a sense 2 dollars have been debited from your account to cover your potential liability since you also own the stock there will be a credit from that line item not shown at the expiry of your option since you are selling covered calls if you were to be exercised on the loss on the option and the gain on the shares you own will net off the final cost basis of the shares you sold will be adjusted by the premium you 've received you will simply be selling your shares at strike + premium per share 0.20 cents in this example

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

chip and pin cards are popular in europe however in the us we do n't have them   visa mc and amex can issue chip and pin cards but no merchants or machines are set up here to take them   only certain countries in europe use them and since you could possibly have a us visitor or a non chip and pin person using your machine or eating at your restaurant they usually allow you to sign or just omit the pin if the card does n't have a chip it is definitely less secure but the entire credit card industry in the us is running right now without it so i do n't think the major credit card companies care too much they just pass the fraud on to the merchants anyway

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

when considering such a major life decision with such high potential costs and high potential rewards i encourage you to consider multiple different potential options even if loans were available they might not be the best option less debt and an engineering degree is better than more debt and an engineering degree both of which are likely better than your current debt and no engineering degree i encourage you to consider revisit your aid which is not just loans cut expenses consider alternative aid sources use your engineering student status to get a better paying job including more profitable summer employment check for methods to cut down the cost of your degree and double check your plans to make sure you have a long term plan that makes sense   the first issue raised in the comments is whether or not you are getting appropriate financial aid this does not just mean loans it includes grants and other forms of assistance   you should be getting in state tuition and by searching the tuition of unc i believe you are but for future readers you should make sure you are getting in state rates and it not there are options to return to a state where you would get in state tuition rates or look into the possibility of your study for one year until you meet in state funding requirements you should also ensure your fafsa information is correct including your income family situation whether or not you are an independent study as it sounds like you probably are etc this effects how many grants you get and if you are independent this changes maximum federal loan amounts see website for details   while you do n't say what your pay is the fact that you are working two jobs and having trouble making ends meet suggests either that you have a spending issue or that your jobs pay sucks and possibly both i 've been in both situations and there are methods for dealing with both if your spending is not very carefully controlled that 's a big issue i wo n't try to rehash all the personal finance advice about this but i will just warn that when you are desperate and you know there is n't enough money even if you spend perfectly there is a strong tendency to just give up and not even try because what 's the point learned is hell but it can be overcome with effort and tightly holding on to any of hope you find to do better each day if you are in a field like engineering or computing and some other fields though i am less personally familiar with the current employment climate in those there are usually companies who want to hire you as a paid intern or part time employee in the hopes of getting you when you graduate those last two semesters of undergrad are a technicality to employers they know it does n't really change your skill set much many companies are actually more interesting in hiring someone on who has n't finished the degree yet than getting someone recently post degree because they can get you cheaper and learn if this is a good match before they have to take the big risk of full time hiring you need to use this system to your advantage its hard when you feel destitute but talk with career councilors in your school your department advisor and/or main administrative staff in your main academic department make sure you are on the right mailing lists to see the job offers many schools require you to subscribe to one because at a school like unc it easily gets way too much traffic each day you need field relevant experience not just to finish the degree but to be able to really open up your job opportunities and earning potential do not be shy about directly calling emailing a contact who reaches out to your school looking for recent graduates and especially any mention of flexibility on early start for those who are almost finished you can say you are in your final year you are and even ask if they are open to working around a light school schedule while you finish up most can end up to be no but it does n't matter the recruiting contacts want to hire people so just reaching out early means you can follow up later once you get your degree and finances sorted out and you will have an even easier time getting that opportunity in technology and engineering the importance of summer internships can not be understated especially as you are now technically at the end of your degree in engineering and tech fields internships pay often very well do n't worry about it being the job of your dreams depending on your set of skills apply to insurance companies it departments in hospitals and banks even if you thought your coding skills in engineering were minimal and of course any paying position that might be more directly in your field of interest consider ones outside your immediate area or even the more national internships from the bigger name companies where possible it is not at all uncommon for tech and engineering internships for undergraduate students to pay $ + per hour even where most non degree jobs might only pay $ 8 and i 've seen as high as $ 40 per in the high cost of living markets depending on your skill set i know many people who were paid more as a student intern than they were previously paid as a full time professional employee many schools including unc charge different tuition for distance learning and satellite campuses and often also offer university approved online classes while this is not always a possibility for every student you should consider the options it could be that one of the final classes you need towards your degree can be taken at one of these other options with reduced tuition this is not always possible with all courses but is certainly true if you have any of those general education requirements to knock out also consider if any of those final requirements have test out options such as test alternatives again not always available but sometimes you can get class credit for a general education class for    finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money attend part time while working look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted inquire about scholarships and school emergency assistance while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options student loan forbearance while in school if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in skip a semester if necessary to save money if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet double check on credit expiration and degree requirements make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't inquire about other government and community based assistance being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you make sure your long term goal makes sense finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment at all   good luck on your journey and best wishes towards better days regardless of what path you choose   finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you

bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment at all good luck on your journey and best wishes towards better days regardless of what path you choose

remember that in most news outlets journalists do not get to pick the titles of their articles   that 's up to the editor   so even though the article was primarily about etfs the reporter made the mistake of including some tangential references to mutual funds   the editor then saw that the article talked about etfs and mutual funds and knowing even less about the subject matter than the reporter but recognizing that more readers eyeballs would be attracted to a headline about mutual funds than to a headline about etfs went with the shocking headline about the former in any case as you already pointed out etfs need to know their value throughout the day as do the investors in that etf   even momentary outages of price sources can be disastrous although mutual funds do not generally make transactions throughout the day and fund investors are not typically interested in the fund 's nav more than once per day the fund managers do n't just sit around all day doing nothing and then press a couple buttons before the market closes   they do watch their nav very closely during the day and think very carefully about which buttons to press at the end of the day   if their source of stock price data goes offline then they 're impacted almost as severely as if less visibly than an etf asking yahoo for prices seems straightforward but 1 you get what you pay for and 2 these fund companies are built on massive automated that expect to receive their data from a certain source in a certain way at a certain time   and they pay a lot of money in order to be able to expect that   it would be quite difficult to just feed in manual data although in the end i suspect some of these companies did just that   either they fell back to a secondary data supplier or they manually constructed datasets for their programs to consume

people normally hold precious metals as a protection against the whole system going down massive inflation etc   if our whole government and financial system broke completely and we returned to a barter economy then holding silver would likely turn out to be a good thing however precious metals are not very good hedges against individual calamity like losing your job   they are costly and inconvenient to sell and the price of these metals fluctuates wildly so you could end up wanting to sell just when the metal is n't worth much i 'd say having some precious metal is n't unreasonable but it should not make up a major portion of one 's total net worth   if you want protection against normal problems especially as a person of limited means start with an emergency savings account and paying down debt   that way fixed costs will be less likely to turn an unfortunate turn of events into a personal catastrophe

this is going to be a list of some things that will likely be of value immediately after some apocalyptic event   however note that i am not answering your question of what you should invest in now to take advantage of such an event   that is a pretty ridiculous notion   preparing oneself for such a possibility is certainly a good idea   that said there are some realistic limitations to how you could take advantage of such a situation   namely the very real requirement of physical security   unless you have a huge armed to the teeth to defend your cache someone will come along with a bigger and better armed group to take it   not to mention that i am the type of person that would at least consider organizing such a group to take you down if only as a matter of principle guns ammo also knives ideally ones that can be used as weapons and for food preparation hunting alcohol   especially liquor   it 's concentrated and easier to store than beer or wine   beside for getting it is useful as a and non perishable foods   canned goods are obvious   though grains and can be stored with relative ease under some circumstances   obviously not so easily done in an urban area methods of starting a fire   preferably rugged ones such as flint and steel   would only be of limited use   matches are bulky and require water tight storage salt and/or salt   possibly other forms of non perishable bait   as bstpierre puts it hunting will be about survival not sport hand tools textiles fabrics thread and needles medicines of all sorts though especially antibiotics and books of a practical nature   topics such as wilderness survival cooking carpentry etc the list is mostly ordered in terms of value practicality ultimately i doubt there is much that will provide a practical investment idea for such a scenario   the physical security issue is a big limiting factor   in a post apocalyptic scenario it goes back to who is bigger stronger and better armed one thing does come to mind knowledge   prepare yourself with the skills and knowledge you need to survive in such a scenario and you will be invaluable   also as bstpierre notes in the comments connections will likely also be important   probably local or nearby connections   no one person can do it all alone   it will come down to cooperation

# 243714
the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy

when we say stock market we are usually thinking of the publicly traded stocks such as the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq shares of individual products do not go on these exchanges only large corporations   you wo n't see a stock ticker symbol for the force or for the iphone plus   the reason for this is that when investors buy a stock they are looking for something that will grow in value theoretically forever individual products usually have a limited lifespan your movie will hopefully generate revenue when it comes out but after a while sales will slow down after people have seen it if someone bought a share of stock in a movie on the stock market they have to realize that eventually the movie will stop making money and their share of stock wo n't be worth anything anymore instead people invest in companies that have the potential to make new products such as disney or apple   so if you were seeing the ticker symbol of your movie going across the screen on cnbc sorry that 's not going to happen   however you could theoretically sell shares to individual investors for a percentage of the profit you figure out how much money you need to create the movie and estimate how much profit you think the movie will earn then you find an investor or group of investors that is willing to give you the money you need in exchange for a percentage of the profit unlike a stock market investor these investors wo n't be looking for the long term growth potential of the resale value of the stock but simply a share of the profit

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

if you are buying and selling mutual funds in the same family of funds e.g. vanguard then you can set up an on line account on the vanguard website and it is easy vanguard offers a transaction service that allows you to sell shares of vfinx say and buy shares of say from the proceeds of the sale all in one swell but if you are holding the vfinx shares through your on line account with say etrade then it depends on what services etrade provides to you will it allow doing all that in one transaction or will it wait for the cash to come from vanguard and then send the money back to vanguard to invest in in any case selling vfinx shares and investing the proceeds in shares say   can not be done on the vanguard site only vanguard will send the proceeds of the sale of the vfinx shares only to your bank account not anywhere else you   then need to tell t. rowe price where you presumably have an account already that you want to invest $ x in shares and to withdraw the cash from your bank account if you are doing it all through etrade then the money from the sale of vfinx goes from vanguard to etrade into something called a sweep account or maybe your cash account at etrade and you invest it in after appropriate delays in receiving the money from vanguard into etrade etc if your cash account bank or etrade has enough of a balance you could sell vfinx and buy on the same day where the purchase is made from the money in the cash account and replaced a few days later by the proceeds from vanguard bouncing of checks or inability to act on a hot tip to invest in something in the interim is your problem not the bank 's or etrade 's

we 've had everything in one pot almost from day one of marriage the key ingredients to making that arrangement work is to communicate about the money and realize that you 're in it together   everything one person does affects the other separating finances the affecting one another part and makes it a little clearer perhaps but i can also see it creating a sense of entitlement this is my money   there should be a place for individual discretionary spending of course but i 'm not sure that off that money is the best way to do it it 's less likely to be viable if there 's one main in the house   in our house this is me   if we separated the finances like this it would amount to giving my wife an allowance   since she works harder at home than i do at work most of the time she keeps the house does meals and shopping raises and schools our daughter etc but just does n't get paid for it it would border on insult to her to treat the finances this way

an resp is a type of account   within the resp you can have cash investments or even savings vehicles like gics etc   so depending on where you put the money within the resp yes there is a chance of losing money if you think your children will attend post secondary education i do n't think that there is a better way to save   the government will match 20 of your contribution up to a maximum grant of $ 500 per year to take advantage of the grant we contribute $ 2500 per year to obtain the maximum $ 500 grant hope this helps

nobody can predict the affects of brexit but it is wise to consider them we saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic if that happens it is likely to increase inflation uk inflation has gone from under 1 around the time of the referendum to 3 today and it could well go higher if inflation continues to increase the bank of england is likely to put up interest rates as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation   we have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the boe has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates   the rates can not continue at this level if inflation starts to rise that in turn will put up mortgage rates   so for example if you have a £ 100k mortgage at currently this is a reasonable rate to have your repayments will be £ 523 a month   if your mortgage rate goes up to say 7 then your repayments are £ a month if it goes up to 10 then it 's £ a month and so on there is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here my advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra there are other risks from brexit as well house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates overall nobody knows what will happen but it is good to be planning ahead for all i am not a financial advisor this advice is given in good faith but with no financial qualification

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

as the commenters have already indicated money market mutual funds are not guaranteed to maintain principal during all market conditions and investments in mutual funds are not insured against loss due to market changes that said you can run a price search on vanguard 's website and see these results so despite all the economic problems since 1975 has never traded at a price other than $ 1.00

you realize that most of the money raised through the ipo process does n't go into the company 's bank account those shares were shares that were held by the investors and original owners and it 's those prior pre ipo shareholders that got their money back along with a tidy profit   the cash on its books was there before the ipo and after the ipo process was more about a change in stock owners ship than anything else    edit as the sec disclosure mentioned in comments below states the facebook ipo raised $ for facebook 's use the rest of the transaction was from the investors selling their shares mark zuckerberg still owns more than 55 of shares outstanding the $ is still about 10 of the company value nothing to ignore but clearly most of the money from the ipo did n't go to the company

create one account    you can change the beneficiary of the plan even to nieces yourself or your wife as many times as you need so long as you are spending the money on valid educational expenses are you 100 sure both of your kids are going to college   if you are n't really 100 sure a single account that you can move between them is the best bet also having recently looked in 529 plans here are some things you have probably already thought about look up good 529 plans here edit i do n't think you can worry about fairly dividing the money up   i can see your wanting to be fair but what is more important school or fairly dividing the money    a 529 is money only for school   assuming your kids are n't the same age and wo n't go to the same school their expenses will likely be different   the younger kid will benefit from more interest from a longer investment but suffer from having higher costs so if you want to insure both kids got $ 50 k for example from you by the time it is all said and done i think you would have to make that up from your own pocket   if only one child goes to school any money you give the other for starting their own business could n't come from the 529 without big tax penalties depending on your position and finances you could state something like i will cover your college expenses up to $ 50 k and then that is that   just monitor your 529 and shoot for having $ 100 k in the account by the time they are both college age   that runs a risk though because if one child does n't go to school your money is locked up for a while or will have tax issues

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns
