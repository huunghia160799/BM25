a non resident alien is only allowed for deductions connected to producing a us sourced income see irc sec thus you can only deduct things that qualify as business expenses and state taxes on your wages in addition you can deduct a bunch of stuff explicitly allowed like tax preparation charitable contributions casualty losses etc but sales tax is not in that list
# 136932
no if you are a nonresident alien you can not deduct sales tax you can only deduct state income tax 1040nr schedule a which is page 3 of 1040nr does not contain an option for sales tax like 1040 schedule a does if you are a resident alien then you can deduct sales tax

let me summarize your question for you i do not have the down payment that the lender requires for a mortgage how can i still acquire the mortgage short answer find another lender or find more cash do n't overly complicate the scenario the correct answer is that the lender is free to do what they want they deem it too risky to lend you $ 1.1 m against this $ 1.8 m property unless they have $ 700k up front you want their money so you must accept their terms if other lenders have the same outlook consider that you can not afford this house find a cheaper house

my take on this is banks want to bring fear to homeowners to get them to go for fixed mortgage rates which are higher also here in canada at least every journalist suddenly is a real estate expert and predicts crashes yet has never written on real estate before there are also the people that want a crash to happen since they missed the boat on the real estate boom and not to mention writing country wide predictions is just pointless did the real estate market in manhattan crash in 2008 i actually do n't know the answer but i highly doubt it

@victor has the most descriptive and basic idea on how this is done   the only thing i would add is that one benefit to real estate is that you can control how much the property is worth   by increasing rents and making the property one of the best in the neighborhood you increase the value as for the comment that this is the type of investing that caused the 1929 stock market crash there are many other aspects that are overlooked   taking equity out of real estate has been happening long before and after the depression   people do it all the time by taking out home equity loans just not everyone uses it to purchase another investment
# 412092
that argument seems pretty false   companies will compete and try to always undercut each other   i have never seen one actual study where prices rose on par when the minimum wage was increased   they of course will increase but it will still be below what is costs now   mainly it takes money from the larger corporations and gives it to the people   i do agree prices will rise but since tons of companies already hire illegals where are we going to be hit   produce will be slightly from stock boys who do nt make that much   for the most part all menial jobs are always using illegal workers

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

you ca n't actually transfer shares directly unless they were obtained as part of an employee share scheme see the answers to questions 19 and 20 on this page q. can i put shares from my employee share scheme into my isa a. you can transfer any shares you get from into a stocks and shares component of an isa without having to pay    capital gains tax provided your isa manager agrees to take them the    value of the shares at the date of transfer counts towards the annual    limit this means you can transfer up to £ worth of shares in the tax    year 2013 14 assuming that you make no other subscriptions to isas    in those years you must transfer the shares within 90 days from the day they cease to    be subject to the plan or for approved share option schemes 90    days of the exercise of option date your employer should be able to    tell you more q. can i put windfall or inherited shares in my isa a. no you can only transfer shares you own into an isa if they have    come from an employee share scheme otherwise the isa manager must    purchase shares on the open market the situation is the same if you have shares that you have inherited    you are not able to transfer them into an isa

the form 1040 u.s. tax return form instructions has a section called do you have to file   below a certain income you are not required to file a tax return and pay any tax   this amount of income at which you are required to file depends on several things including your dependency status you are a dependent of your parents your marital status and other factors   the instructions have charts that show what these numbers are   you would fall under chart b. assuming that you are under age 65 unmarried and not blind you only have to file when you reach the following conditions your unearned income was over $ your earned income was over $ 6,300 your gross income was more than the larger $ or your earned income up to $ plus $ 350 note income from youtube would count as earned income for the purposes above however if you are producing your own videos and receiving revenue from them you are technically self employed   this means that the conditions from chart c also apply which state you must file a return if any of the five conditions below apply for 2015 as a self employed person you can deduct business expenses expenses that you incur in producing your product which is this case is your videos   once your revenue minus your expenses reach $ 400 you will need to file an income tax return

the best answer for you is going to depend completely on your financial goals   do you want to be debt free   are you comfortable with the risks of long distance rentals   do you have good resources to take care of any issues where the properties are at    you ca n't directly compare the returns of risky investments versus the risk free return of paying off debt the expected return of the property might be higher that the interest on the loan but when you incorporate risk there 's a decent chance that you 'll make less money on the property than you pay on the loan other things to consider another way to think about it is   if you did not have the debt or the houses would you borrow money at 4 or whatever your student loan is at to buy a rent house in arizona

it is worth noting first that interest and short term dividends capital gains are all taxed at the same rate so all the investments below i mention even savings accounts will be taxed at the same rate   also even short term capital losses can often be harvested to reduce your tax rate in many countries while it is worth paying attention to the taxes when investing in the short term the more important factor is how much risk that you can take or want to take with the money   most equity portfolios like the s&p index give a much higher risk that there will be much less in the account when you need to buy   you generally have a higher expected return with equity but as you mention that return is very random over such a short period over such a short variable period many people will invest in short term bond index funds or just keep the fund in a high yielding savings account   with the savings account your money is guaranteed   short term bond funds will have generally higher yields but a small chance you may lose money in the short term some people can trade short term bond indices for free with their broker but if you ca n't be sure to include the trading costs when thinking about which investment to use as with how low yields are currently the fees may eat up any advantage you gain

both a trust and an estate are separate legal entities just like any individual income earned by the trust or estate property e.g. rents collected from real estate is income earned by the trust or the estate who is liable for taxes on income earned by a trust depends on who receives or retains benefits from the trust who is liable for taxes on income received by an estate depends on how the income is classified i.e. income earned by the decedent income earned by the estate income in respect of the decedent or income distributed to beneficiaries generally trusts and estates are taxed like individuals general tax principles that apply to individuals therefore also apply to trusts and estates a trust or estate may earn income and may deduct certain expenses each is allowed a small exemption $ 300 for a simple trust $ 100 for a complex trust $ 600 for an estate however neither is allowed a standard deduction the tax brackets for income taxable to a trust or estate are much more compressed and can result in higher taxes than for individuals in short the trust should have been paying taxes on its gains all along when the money transfers to you it will be taxed as ordinary income

short answer   no longer answer   the only reason to move would be to get out of the condo and into a of equal cost because condos can be quite difficult to sell and you do n't really want that potential burden later on   moving is expensive though and you ca n't afford to spend more when you are already living on the financial edge speaking of living on the edge that 's a recipe for disaster   i make ratio wise a similar sort of income   even accounting for the generous college tuition you should be able to save at least $ 20 k per year at a bare minimum   and if you were careful i figure you should be able to save $ 40k year   you need to figure out where you are dumping all of your money and cut way back on spending and focus entirely on saving money 1   stop eating out   make your own meals   i average about $ 2 per meal per person no junk food   eating out is 6 to 30 times as expensive as making meals at home   do the math   $ 10 2 people number of times you eat out per week 52 $ per year for each time week vs $ 2 2 people 21 3 meals per day 52 $ per year for both of you maximum   now i know some meals are more expensive to prepare but the math is not unrealistic i spend about $ 140 per month on groceries and make the bulk of my own food   eating out is sticker shock for me   the food i prepare is balanced and complete   now i 'm not a complete health nut   i love the occasional deep fried treat or hamburger but those are once every couple of months sort of things which makes them special 2   stop going to starbucks or wherever you go   it takes fuel to get there   it 's also expensive when you get there   bring your own drink if you are hanging out with friends 3   drop golf   or whatever expensive sport you are sinking money into   invest in some cheap running clothes and focus on based   heart health is more important than anything else   if you ca n't live without your sport then find an alternate sport that is equal ish in challenge but a ton cheaper to play   for example if you like playing golf play instead most cities have courses there 's no cost beyond a couple of discs and the challenge is still there 4   drop entertainment   movies at the theater are expensive   drop your cable subscription you are getting financially raped for $   get a netflix subscription and find shows via free online streaming services   buy some dominoes card games and a couple of classic board games   keep entertainment simple and cheap 5   drop your cell phone 's data plan   republic wireless is the only decent cellular provider and even their $ plan is living a luxury lifestyle   if you spend more than $ 10/month person for phone service you are spending too much 6   stop driving everywhere   gas is expensive   cars are expensive   if you have more than two cars sell the extras   if your car is worth more than $ 20,000 sell it and get something cheaper 7   stop drinking alcohol   alcohol impairs mental functions is addictive smells terrible and is ridiculously expensive   there 's no actual need to consume it either by the way do n't go and make major financial changes without the wife 's sign off   finances are the 1 reason for divorce   so get her ok on this stuff   hopefully you already knew that   the above are just some common financial pitfalls where people sink thousands and thousand of dollars and gain nothing   you can still have a full and complete life with just a minimum of the above there is no excuse for living on the edge financially   your story is one i 'm going to share with those who give me the same excuse because they are poor   you are i want to punch you in the face wealthy and you spend every last penny because you think that 's how money works   you are wrong one final piece of advice   find a financial adviser   it is clear to me that you 've been managing money wrong your whole life   a financial adviser will look at your situation and help you far more than someone on the internet ever can   if you attend a church many churches have the excellent crown financial program available which teaches sound financial management principles   the education system does n't show people how to manage money but that 's not an excuse either   once you dig yourself out of the financial hole you 've dug for yourself you can pass the knowledge on how to correctly manage money onto other people

for your business depends a lot on what you expect to see over the next several years in terms of income and expenses and the extent to which you want or need to pay for fringe benefits or make pretax retirement contributions from your business income there are four basic flavors of entity which are available to you sole proprietorship this is the simplest option in terms of tax reporting and paperwork required for ongoing operations your net gross minus expenses income is added to your wage income and you 'll pay tax on the total if your wage income is less than approximately $ 100 k you 'll also owe self employment tax of approximately 15 in addition to income tax on your business income if your business runs at a loss you can deduct the loss from your other income in calculating your taxable income though you wo n't be able to run at a loss indefinitely you are liable for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of all of your personal assets partnership you will need at least two participants humans or entities to form a partnership individual items of income and expense are identified on a partnership tax return and each partner 's proportionate share is then reported on the individual partners tax returns general partners who actively participate in the business also must pay self employment tax on their earnings below approximately $ 100k. each general partner is responsible for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of their personal assets a general partnership can be created informally or with an oral agreement although that 's not a good idea corporation business entities can be taxed as s or c corporations either way the corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with a state government does n't have to be the state where you live and corporations are typically required to file yearly entity statements with the state where they were formed as well as all states where they do business shareholders are only liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation to the extent of their investment in the corporation an s corporation files an information only return similar to a partnership which reports items of income and expense but those items are actually taken into account on the individual tax returns of the shareholders if an s corporation runs at a loss the losses are deductible against the shareholders other income   a c corporation files a tax return more similar to an individual 's a c corporation calculates and pays its own tax at the corporate level payments from the c corporation to individuals are typically taxable as wages from a tax point of view it 's the same as having a second job or as dividends depending on how and why the payments are made if they 're in exchange for effort and work they 're probably wages if they 're payments of business profits to the business owners they 're probably dividends if a c corporation runs at a loss the loss is not deductible against the shareholders other income   fringe benefits such as health insurance for business owners are not deductible as business expenses on the business returns for s corps partnerships or sole proprietorships c corporations can deduct expenses for providing fringe benefits   llcs do n't have a predefined tax treatment the members or managers of the llc choose when the llc is formed if they would like to be taxed as a partnership an s corporation or as a c corporation if an llc is owned by a single person it can be considered a disregarded entity and treated for tax purposes as a sole proprietorship this option is not available if the llc has multiple owners   the asset protection provided by the use of an entity depends quite a bit on the source of the claim if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on a contract signed on behalf of the entity then they likely will not be able to pierce the veil and collect the entity 's debts from the individual owners on the other hand if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on negligence or another tort like action such as sexual harassment then it 's very likely that the involved will also be sued as individuals which takes away a lot of the effectiveness of the purported asset protection the entity based asset protection is also often unavailable even for contract claims because sophisticated creditors like banks and landlords will often insist the the business owners sign a personal guarantee putting their own assets at risk in the event that the business fails to honor its obligations   there 's no particular type of entity which will allow you to entirely avoid tax most tax planning revolves around income and expense items in the most favorable ways possible or around controlling the timing of the appearance of those items on the tax return

thank you for the informed post cat was planning on opening a new plant before the earthquake they needed more capacity and were formerly exporting some from japan to the north american market they were considering expanding that plant and they also looked at sites in canada the us and mexico i guess they decided to keep that plant open but just focus it on other markets article is an article but it is short on details   article is an example of cat closing a plant in canada after the labor union locked themselves out they are moving jobs to the us for roughly half price in this case the plant in canada was paying an average wage of $ 35 $ annually without overtime and they locked themselves out requesting more corporations try to maximize profit so by definition they are greedy but this is a perfect example of unions being overly greedy as well that is well over a good middle class wage assuming they are in a somewhat rural or sparse suburban area where most manufacturing is located they had capacity elsewhere so they moved    ignoring the greed of the unions wo nt make things better for workers it will only end in more situations like the one in canada

when you set up a short sale for equities you are borrowing stock from someone else typically another client at the broker   the broker usually an agreement to let your shares be borrowed for short sales in your account details   so if client a wants to short a stock he borrows stock from client b to do the short sale it 's usually not this direct as they can borrow from many clients   if client b then wants to sell his shares if the broker ca n't shift around assets to find another client 's shares to let client a borrow then he has to close the short position out because he does n't have the shares in the brokerage to let client a borrow to short anymore

first for anyone else reading an ira that has no beneficiary listed on the account itself passes through the will and this eliminates the opportunity to take withdrawals over the beneficiaries lifetimes there 's a five year distribution requirement also with a proper beneficiary set up on the ira account the will does not apply to the ira an ira with me as sole beneficiary regardless of the will saying all my assets i leave to the this is also a warning to keep that beneficiary current it 's possible that one 's ex spouse is still on ira or 401(k accounts as beneficiary and new spouse is in for a surprise when hubby wife passes sorry for the tangent but this is all important to know the funneling of a beneficiary ira through a trust is not for amateurs if set up incorrectly the trust will not allow the stretch lifetime withdrawals but will result in a broken ira trusts are not cheap nor would i have any faith in any attorney setting it up i would only use an attorney who specializes in trusts and estate planning as littleadv suggested they do n't have to be minors it turns out that the expense to set up the trust $ k depending on location can help keep your adult child from blowing through a huge ira quickly i 'd suggest that the trust distribute the rmds in early years and a higher amount say 10 in years to follow unless you want it to go just rmd for its entire life or greater flexibility releasing larger amounts based on life events   the tough part of that is you need a trustee who is willing to handle this and will do it at a low cost   if you go with child 's name only i do n't know many year old kids who would either understand the rmd rules on iras or be willing to use the money over decades instead of blowing it   edit a wsj article inherited iras a sweet deal and my own on my death please take a breath an article that suggests for even an adult education on how rmds work is a great idea

i think that westerners often overestimate how much influence the west has over developing countries like those in africa and that there are a million other factors that most of the western public simply does n't see    yes agricultural production has increased significantly because of western and eastern demand which calls more children into laboring in those fields because that 's just how it 's always been done in those cotton producing countries of course more business also means more income for those farmers who you can bet your bottom dollar would ask consumers to buy more of their cotton and not less   higher incomes leads to many other positives for the local and national economy families individuals and yes those children that 's not to say that schooling would n't be preferable to child labor but 1 that 's not ultimately our decision and 2 that makes a quite questionable assumption that decent affordable accessible schooling even exists there    so my assessment is that western demand for cotton is a positive for the kids in what 's more i will guarantee you that even with all the failings and unpleasant parts of the world cotton commodity trade cotton farmers would agree

cash price is $ 22,500 financed it 's the same thing 0 interest but you pay a $ 1500 fee = 6.6 basically the apr for your loan is 1.1 per year but you are paying it all upfront opportunity cost if you take the $ 22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it could you earn more than the $ 1500 interest on the car loan according to google as of today you can get 1 year cd 1.25 so yes it 's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more   insurance cost if you finance you 'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly however if you are planning to get it anyway it 's a brand new car after all that 's a wash which brings me to my main point why do you have $ 90k in a savings account even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest   conclusion take the cheap money while it 's available you never know when interest rates will go up again

i finally found it johnson controls international plc form a amended current report filing filed for the period ending from says on page my emphasis for the relevant paragraph on september 2 2016 johnson controls and tyco completed their    combination pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger the merger    agreement dated as of january 24 2016 as amended by amendment no    1 dated as of july 1 2016 by and among johnson controls tyco and    certain other parties named therein including merger sub llc an    indirect wholly owned subsidiary of tyco merger sub    pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement on september 2 2016    merger sub merged with and into johnson controls with johnson controls    being the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned    indirect subsidiary of tyco the merger    following the merger tyco changed its name to johnson controls    international plc   immediately prior to the merger and in connection    tyco shareholders received ordinary shares of tyco    which shares are now referred to as combined company ordinary shares    for each tyco ordinary share they held by virtue of a one    share consolidation in the merger each outstanding share of common    stock par value $ 1.00 per share of johnson controls johnson controls    common stock other than shares held by johnson controls tyco and    certain of their subsidiaries was converted into the right to receive    either the cash consideration or the share consideration each as    described below at the election of the holder subject to    procedures described in the merger agreement and applicable withholding    taxes    the election to receive the cash consideration was as a    result holders of shares of johnson controls common stock that elected    to receive the share consideration and holders of shares of johnson    controls common stock that made no election or failed to properly make    an election became entitled to receive for each such share of johnson    controls common stock $ in cash without interest and    combined company ordinary shares subject to applicable withholding    taxes    holders of shares of johnson controls common stock that elected to    receive the cash consideration became entitled to receive for each such    share of johnson controls common stock $ in cash without    interest subject to applicable withholding taxes    in the merger johnson controls shareholders received in the aggregate    approximately $ billion in cash immediately after the closing of    and giving effect to the merger former johnson controls shareholders    owned approximately 56 of the issued and outstanding combined company    ordinary shares and former tyco stockholders owned approximately 44 of    the issued and outstanding combined company ordinary shares this answers what actually happened in the transaction as far as my cost basis in the new jci it 's a little more obscure on page it says for pro forma purposes the valuation of consideration transferred is    based on amongst other things the adjusted share price of johnson    controls on september 2 2016 of $ per share and on page johnson controls adjusted share price as of september 2 2016 2 $ 2 amount equals johnson control closing share price and market    capitalization at september 2 2016 $ and $ million    respectively adjusted for the tyco $ million cash contribution    used to purchase million shares of johnson controls stock for    $ per share and both agree with the information posted at merger transaction fair value of consideration transferred details which i ca n't seem to find on an official website but it purports to post from the sec edgar database     so for each share of jci it had a fair value of $ prior to the acquisition and transformed into $ in cash plus of new jci shares with a basis of $ $ = $ stated in terms of new jci shares this is $ = $ per new jci share i 'm not really 100 sure of this calculation though   i also found jci 's form which states fair market value generally is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the facts u.s. federal income tax law does not specifically prescribe how former jci shareholders should determine the fair market value of the tyco ordinary shares received in the merger   one possible method of determining the fair market value of one tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger which was $ other methods for determining the fair market value of tyco ordinary shares are possible former jci shareholders are not bound by the approach described above and may in consultation with their tax advisors use another approach    as well as similar text on the irs website one possible method of determining the fair market value of one tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger which was $ using this figure former jci shareholders that elected to receive shares in the merger would receive cash and tyco ordinary shares worth approximately $ per share of jci common stock exchanged in the merger assuming no cash received in lieu of fractional shares

it surely does n't hurt to keep a receipt i tend to pile up receipts in my desk drawer never look at them and then every few months throw them all out if a vendor writes a receipt by hand or if the cash register is not tied in to the credit card system keeping a receipt could give you evidence against mistakes or fraud like if the vendor gives you a receipt for $ 10 and then sends a transaction to the credit card company for $ 20 you could use the receipt as evidence of the problem but if the vendor is trying to really cheat you the most likely thing for him to do is run the legitimate transaction through and then some time later run a fake transaction so say today you go to vendor x buy something for $ 20 and he bills your credit card $ 20 then a few days later he bills you another $ 100 even though you never came back to the store sure you have a receipt for $ 20 but you do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 because you never authorized that transaction your receipt proves nothing presumably you 're not disputing the $ 20 if you complain to the bank or go to the police or whatever saying hey look i do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 does n't prove anything how do they know you did n't just throw it away it 's difficult to prove that you never had such a receipt

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

selfish capitalists sigh   look we both agree that large concentrations of wealth should be redistributed i personally believe in a heavy estate tax the rich are limited on what you can pass on to kids amp spouses i think that would solve a lot of problems honestly but that 's just me    we both agree on taxes i am more than happy to pay my 30 amp understand the benefits of it i would argue i and many other high income earners can do more good with compounding my money and giving all of it away upon my death and living off of the interest but i doubt i would be able to convince you of that   what we disagree on is the definition of hard work if 1 man make 10 an hour and works really hard and another figures out a way to work smarter and can make 100 and work less every economic theory agrees you should pay the man who made 100 more even though the man who made 10 might have worked harder   if my father choose to join the military and was very smart and able to lead well you give him a stable career if i was efficient   at planning my college major career and investments i get paid more have less debt and am able to save more and compound my savings into capital   results are more important than hard work or to be frank the effort you put into your work does n't mean shit it 's all about productivity that 's why you hear the common participation generation from older generations     so no it is n't luck but i doubt i can change your mind i used to think like you until one day i told myself no more excuses i am in charge of everything about my life from that day i have been and obsessive to make the smart choices in life that allow me to be happy    just food for thought

first as noted in the comments you need to pay attention to your network providers   if you are unable to pay exorbitant prices out of pocket then find an in network medical provider   if you are unhappy with the in network provider list e.g. too distant or not specialists then discuss switching to another plan or insurer with your employer or broker second many providers will have out of pocket or uninsured price lists often seen in outdated formats or   since you have asked for price lists and not been provided one i would pursue it with the practice manager or equivalent or else a doctor and ask if they have one   it 's possible that the clinic has an out of pocket price list but the front line staff is unaware of it and was never trained on it third if you efforts to secure a price list fail and you are especially committed to this specific provider then i would consider engaging in a friendly by direct negotiation with the practice manager or other responsible person   person they will be amenable to creating a list of prices if you are particularly proactive and aggressive you could offer to find out of pocket price lists from other clinics nearby   you could also flat out ask them to charge you a certain fee for office visits if you do this try to get some sort of offer or agreed price list in writing   most medical practices are uncomfortable asking patients for money so that may mean flat refusal to negotiate but it may also mean surprising willingness to work with you   this route is highly unpredictable before you go down it and it 's dependent on all sorts of things like the ownership structure business model and the personalities of the key people there the easiest answer is to switch clinics   this one sounds very unfriendly to hsa patients

first of all congratulations on paying off $ 40k in debt in one year mathematically you 'd be better off making the standard car loan payments and putting your extra money toward the student loan however there are a few other things that you might want to consider over the last year you 've knocked out a whole bunch of different debts   feels pretty good does n't it   at your current rate you could knock out your new car loan in 6 months   then you 'd only have one debt left   if it sounds to you like it would be nice to only have one debt left then it might be worth the mathematical disadvantage you would get by paying off the car early instead of putting the money toward the last student loan the car loan is 0 but if you are late on a single payment they will take that opportunity to raise your interest rate to something probably higher than the interest rate of your student loan   for this reason you may decide it is not worth the hassle and you 'd rather just eliminate the car loan as quickly as possible either choice is fine in my opinion as long as you have a purpose behind the choice and you are committed to eliminating both debts as quickly as possible as an aside it is important to remember that even a 0 loan is not really free money and needs to be paid back   you know this of course but sometimes you see a 0 loan and it feels like free money   it 's not   you have probably already paid for the loan by forfeiting a rebate   so although at this point having already taken this loan and paying for it you will come out ahead by dragging out your car loan for the full term in the future do not think that you can make money by buying something at 0 interest

i can see the point of it but you also have to remember what kind of people are working here to begin with they are often people with a high school education or equivalent with no additional training or education that does n't leave a lot of jobs open and pretty much regardless of where they work the market wage is going to be low because they are extremely interchangeable that is to say this is the working poor the people that the government targets quite a bit so they 'll have a negative external impact on the rest of the economy as a whole    so while it does cost you money per year really the more important question is if these people were employed elsewhere or not employed what would the cost be and if there is any difference to where the government is paying more then they should be taxed by that amount to pay for the externality

how can i say this more clearly scam scam scam this is another one of the oldest scams out there where you 've won a prize or an inheritance has come in and all you have to do is pay the taxes on it to claim it do n't be a sucker   ask yourself why the government could n't and would n't just take the taxes due out of the funds they have and give the rest to the person they belong to   would n't that be the smartest and easiest thing to do as an example let 's say that you have $ 1,000 that belongs to me and i owe you $ 100   would you tell me to pay you the $ 100 and then you 'll give me the $ 1,000 or would you take the $ 100 i owe you out of the $ 1,000 and give me the remaining $ 900 the fact this is someone you know from the internet and they want your help to claim their money should tell you how much of a scam this is stop talking to this person and do n't tell them anything personal about you   they are scam artists and whatever you tell them could be used to steal your identity or take your money be careful my friend

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

technically this does n't seem like a scam but i do n't think the system is beneficial   they use a lot of half truths to convince you that their product is right for you some of the arguments presented and my thoughts do n't buy term and invest the rest because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn from the rest    also do n't invest in a 401k because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn they are correct that you wo n't know exactly how much you 'll have due to stock market but that does n't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money   investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules   yes 401ks have withdrawal rules ca n't typically start before 59.5 must start by 70.5 but those rules do n't hamper my investing style in any way     most term life insurance policies do n't pay out   they are correct again but their conclusions are wrong yes most people do n't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why term life insurance is relatively cheap    but they are n't arguing you do n't need insurance just that you need their insurance which is better you need the guaranteed growth they offer   the chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non guaranteed dividends    they invest $ 10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $ 1,000,000    that 's a 5 return   i use 10 for my estimate of stock market performance but let 's say it 's only 8    the same $ 10,000 per year results in over $ 2 million dollars   using 10.5 average return of the s&p 500 over it 's lifetime the result is a staggering $ 3.7 million    so if i 'm looking at $ 3.7 m vs. $ 1 m it costs me $ 2.7 million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy that 's one expensive term life insurance policy my personal favorite blindly following the advice of wall street and financial gurus such as dave ramsey and suze orman got you where you are are you happy with the state of your finances do you still believe their buy term insurance and invest the difference   yes i sure do believe that and i 'm quite well thank you while i do n't think this is a scam it 's outrageously expensive and not a good financial choice

the answer is that it depends on your bank and your creditor whomever you are paying most banks offer overdraft protection for a fee they will process the payment as if you had the money and your account will become overdrawn the next deposit you put in will be applied to the overdraft and once the account is zeroed funds will begin to become available the fees charged and whether a particular charge will go through depend on the bank a few banks will process a payment without a fee if it only happens occasionally some will hit you with a charge per debit in excess of the amount while others will charge you per day on which debit transactions were made while your account was overdrawn and still others will tack on a charge for leaving your account overdrawn for an extended period in almost all cases the for profit institutions banks will charge more than non profit institutions credit unions   watch out for banks that offer automatic overdraft transfer they 'll automatically transfer from another account including eek a credit card to cover a debit to an account with insufficient funds sounds great but the fee they charge is often close to the overdraft fee while without overdraft protection if the payment were simply denied at point of sale most banks have smartphone apps that allow for instantaneous transfer of funds for free i 've never heard of a partial payment you either have sufficient funds to cover the debit or you do n't if you do n't and you do n't have overdraft protection the bank will simply decline to pay the result of that situation depends on the exact circumstances if a utility check bounces they may try to run it again the next day or they may immediately cut your utilities and come after you for the balance at point of sale they simply wo n't give you the merchandise some places are really about pursuing hot check writers if the check does n't clear you have to pay in cash on the spot or they call the police as far as interest on debt it does n't work that way it 's a service fee otherwise it would be subject to some pretty hefty federal regulation however if you figure it as interest you 'd be amazed let 's say you bought lunch at a burger joint for $ 10 you did n't have enough in the account but it was close so the bank let it go and charged you $ 35 you have effectively inflated the cost of that meal to $ 45 a 350 instantaneous price increase or if you prefer 350 interest on that $ 10 i dunno about you but if i were paying $ 45 for one lunch it would n't be at a burger joint most banks simply will not process a check on an already overdrawn account overdraft service or otherwise they 'll hit you for the overdraft fee usually actually a fee for an nsf check and decline the payment so if you had $ 1 in your account and wrote a rent check for $ 1000 it 'd still bounce even with overdraft service

there are people well companies who make money doing roughly what you describe but not exactly they 're called market makers their value for x% is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is volatile but they use leverage shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it 's nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity the reason you ca n't do this is that you do n't have enough capital to do what market makers do and you do n't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices hence the bid offer spread they have to be able to cover large short term losses on individual stocks but when the stock does n't move too much they do make profits from the spread the reason you ca n't just buy a lot of volatile stocks assuming i do n't make too many poor choices is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices so if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers so what 's your strategy for ensuring there are n't too many supposing that you 're going to hold 10 stocks with 10 of your money in each what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them or maybe not all 10 but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that they 're going to hit your target any time soon do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your x% target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long term investor after all or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by if you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades then you can not assess your strategy as if you always make an x% gain since that is n't true if you do n't ever sell at a loss then you 'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers the big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists for how long and whether it 's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing so sure if you used a short term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today then it would be more profitable to day trade those than it would be to invest for the long term investing on the assumption that you 'll only pick short term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine there are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market the simple strategy you describe is n't complete and can not be assessed since you do n't say how to decide what to buy but the selling strategy sell as soon as i 've made x% but not otherwise can certainly be improved if you 're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how you 're doing in 12 months when using historical data you have to be realistic about how you 'd choose what stocks to buy each day or else you 're just cheating at when using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months in which case you wo n't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real you also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you 'd be paying and the fact that you 're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price you ca n't trade at the headline mid market price finally you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual you are in effect competing against a bank that 's on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade it has a and a team of kids and it 's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are this is not to say the ca n't do well but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will so folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long term trends

truthfully i do n't know but in actuality a 4 5 billion dollar loss even is n't the big deal it 's more important that they lost almost of market cap   now realistically it 's relatively oversold in my opinion and they will make it back eventually but that has more of an impact on them in the here and now   as far as the offset you are asking about i 'm not sure personally i do n't trust any accounting practices of banks in reality it 's entirely possible that not even the c suite understands their exact financial position at any given time   the reports of this loss actually came out about a month before they were even able to make an educated guess as to how much their losses would be     in any case there are much more qualified knowledgeable people on here that could likely answer your question a bit better

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

repurchase agreements are a way of financing a security position you have a collateralized loan where you give your security in exchange for cash let 's say you have a 10 year treasury note paying 3.5 while the repurchase rate is 0.5 you loan the security to someone with a promise to repurchase it from them some time in the future you   collect the 3.5 coupon and you pay the 0.5 interest clearly it makes no sense for someone to collect interest on money and also collect coupon payments and for the counter party it makes no sense to be not getting coupon payments and also to be paying interest this how one website explains the process during the transaction any coupon payments that come due belong to    the legal owner the borrower however when this happens a cash    amount equal to the coupon is paid to the original owner this is    called manufactured payment in order to avoid the tax payment on    the coupon some institutions will repo the security to a tax exempt    entity and receive the manufactured payment and avoid the tax coupon    washing i find this description to be the clearest during the life of the transaction the market risk and the credit risk    of the collateral remain with the seller because he has agreed to    repurchase the asset for an agreed sum of money at maturity provided    the trade is correctly documented if the collateral has a coupon    payment during the life of the repo the buyer is obliged to pay this    to the seller

a long straddle using equity would be more akin to buying a triple leveraged etf and an inverse triple leveraged etf only because one side will approach zero while the other can theoretically increase to infinity in a short time span before time decay hits in the reason your analogy fails is because the delta is 1.0 on both sides of your trade at the money options a necessary requirement for a straddle have a delta of .5 there is an options strategy that uses in the money calls and puts with a delta closer to 1.0 to create an in the money strangle i 'm not sure if it is more similar to your strategy an analogous options strategy would be better than yours as it would not share the potential for a margin call

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

your money management technique is a very personal choice each person 's system will be a little different for us we do n't believe in debt so we operate on a cash basis for everything with the exception of our house we keep our expenses to roughly 75 of our after tax income the rest we save and invest and we are paying extra on our mortgage to get the house paid off asap each person will divide their 75 differently based on your consumption preferences   the same goes for the 25 savings and investing   you need to set some goals and save accordingly

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

i speak from a position of experience my bs and ms are both in comp sci i know very little about loans or finances that is very unfortunate as you are obviously an intelligent human being   perhaps this is a good time to pause your formal education and get educated in personal finance   to me it is that important i study computer science and am thus confident that i will be able to find work after i finish school this kind of attitude can lead to trouble   you will likely have a high salary but that does not always translate into prosperity   personal finance is more about behavior then mathematics   i currently work with people that have high salaries in a low cost of living area   some have lost homes due to foreclosure some are very limited in their options because of high student loan balances   some are millionaires without hitting the ipo startup lotto   the difference is behavior it 's possible that someone in my family will be able to cosign and help me out with this loan this is indicative of lack of knowledge and poor financial behavior   this kind of thing can lead to strained relationships to the point where people do n't talk to each other   never co sign for anyone and if you value the relationship with a person never ask them to co sign i 'll be working as a ta again for a $ 1000 stipend yikes   why in the world would you work for 1 k when you need 4 k   you should find a way to earn 6 k this semester so you can save some and put some toward the loans you already acquired   accepting this kind of situation raises red flags on your attitude towards personal finance   and yes it is possible you can earn that waiting tables and if you can find a part time programming gig you can make a lot more then that   consider working as a ta and wait tables until you find that first programming gig i am just about done with my undergraduate degree and will be starting graduate school at the same university next semester to me this is a recipe for failure in most cases   you have all your financing options to date and are planning to go backwards even more   why not get out of school with your bs and go to work   you can save up some of your ms tuition and most companies will provide tuition reimbursement    computer science software engineering can be a fickle market   right now things are going crazy and times are really good   however that was not always the case during my career and unlikely for yours   for example just this year i my highest rate of pay that occurred in 2003   i was out of work most of 2004 and for part of 2005 i actually made less then when i was working while in college   in 2009 my company cut our salaries by 5 but the net cost to me was more like a 27 cut   in 2001 i worked as a contractor for a company that had a 10 reduction in full time employees yet they kept us contractors working    recently i talked with a recruiter about a position doing which is what i am doing now   it required a high level security clearance which is not an easy thing to get   the rub was that it was located in a higher cost of living area and only paid about 70 of what i am making now   they required more and paid less but such is the market   you need to learn about these things good luck

most markets around the world have been for the last 6 to 10 months the definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs and until you get a higher low and confirmation with a higher high the downtrend will continue if you look at the weekly charts of most indexes you can determine the longer term trend if you are more concerned with the medium term trend then you could look at the daily charts so if your objective is to try and buy individual stocks and try to make some medium to short term profits from them i would start by first looking at the daily charts of the index your stock belongs to only buy when the intermediate trend of the market is moving up higher highs and higher lows   you can do some brief analysis on the stocks your interested in buying and two things i would add to the short list in your question would be to check if earnings are increasing year after year the second thing to look at would be to check if the earnings yield is greater than the dividend yield that way you know that dividends are being paid out from current earnings and not from previous earning or from borrowings you could then check the daily charts of these individual stocks and make sure they are uptrending also buy uptrending stocks in an uptrending market before you buy anything write up a trading plan and develop your trading rules for example if price breaks through the resistance line of a previous high you will buy at the open of the next day have your money management and risk management rules in place and stick to your plan you can also do some backtesting or paper trading to check the validity of your strategy a good book to read on money and risk management is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp your aim should not be to get a winner on every trade but to let your winners run and keep your losses small

i am in complete agreement with you   the place i have found with the sort of charts you are looking for is    to compare the percentage increase of several stocks over a period of 2 market open days or more which is quite useful to follow the changes in various stocks etc an example   here the tickers are aa to otc and $ gold $ silver for the spot gold silver price that is n't really a ticker   it is set to show the last 6 market days one the 6 in   you can change it in the url above or change it on the site for the stocks you want up to 25 in one chart but it gets really hard to tell them apart   by moving the slider just left of the at the bottom right corner of the chart you can look at 2 days or more   for a specific time period in days highlight the and type any number of market open days you want 21 days = about one month etc   by setting a time period in days and moving the entire slider you can see how your stocks did in the last bull bear run as an example the site has a full how to for this and the other types of charts they offer the only problem is that many otc stocks are not charted save the comparison charts you use regularly in a folder in your browser bookmarks     i see the entire needed link is n't in blue but you need it all

you 'll generally get a number close to market cap of a mature company if you divide profits or more accurately its free cash flow to equity by the cost of equity which is usually something like     the value is meant to represent the amount of cash you 'd need to generate investment income off it matching the company you 're looking at imagine it as asking how much money do i need to put into the bank so that my interest income would match the profits of the company i 'm looking at except replace the bank with the market and other forms of investments that generate higher returns of course and that value would be lower

prediction costs wo n't go down     the basis for that is the cost of insurance for health has never gone down in the history of that product mainly due to the fixed market   there is competition but pricing is so rigged as health insurance companies and employers have completely removed pricing from consumers experience     until everyone has individual independent insurance away from their jobs healthcare costs will never be in check when employers gtfo of your business and stop providing benefits and people have to buy their own insurance that is the only time there will be any real market or real pricing in healthcare medical

if the insurance policy is a whole life or variable life policy it might have a surrender value that the owner of the policy might be able to get by the policy in whole if it is a term life policy it has no surrender value in many cases the owner of the policy is also the insured and so ask uncle joe whether he would be willing to surrender the life insurance policy and give you the proceeds now instead of making you wait till he passes away if it is a term life policy ask him to consider not renewing the policy and from now on just give you the premium he would have been paying to the insurance company whether he will pay you increasing amounts in later years as a renewable five year level term policy might require is a more delicate matter that you can negotiate with him on the other hand if the policy owner is aunt but the insured is uncle joe and you are the beneficiary talk to aunt instead she is the one who can cancel the policy not uncle joe and for heaven 's sake do n't grease the to facilitate uncle joe 's first step onto the to heaven there are depending on where you live various laws prohibiting payments to beneficiaries who have had a hand in arranging for the happy event to occur

your chart and your claim do n't match you 're looking at one marginal tax rate and saying that its historical change does n't impact overall federal revenues this is true on the surface but you 're only looking at one aspect of the overall picture   saying that federal revenue does n't correlate with tax rates is disingenuous an across the board cut or an across the board increase will both have significant effect likewise an increase to the top marginal tax rate by itself would have an impact as long as there were no corresponding cuts or increased expenditures to wipe out the impact   a budget is a budget whether it 's a great big one like the federal government 's or a small one like a household budget   revenues and expenses need to match in order for the budget to balance increasing tax rates increases revenue from everyone within the affected tax bracket it makes an impact

gt;i do nt see what 's the big deal all the banks got bailed out govt printed over 7 trillion bucks not much inflation govt has to help private sector gave plenty of freebies to the rich mother in the banking sector   yes that was bullshit i agree the difference is that most of the money that went to the banks is held with the banks it did n't cause inflation because it is n't circulating in the economy the government also had to do something with the banks because it would have triggered a major depression if they did n't i do n't think they handled it the best way at all they should have nationalized the banks after the bailouts rather than let them keep thriving however students do n't need that extra debt that would be $ 1 trillion extra that actually is circulating in the economy which would cause serious inflation that would mean faqs the amount of money in circulation that is a lot different than the trillions the government printed mostly just to set monetary policy

i know this can be confusing because you tend to think of money being worth the face value so let 's eliminate that for the sake of an example that will be easier to understand let 's say your friend loaned you rock worth $ 10 today he expects you to pay him back an identical rock whenever you can now let 's also assume that historically the price of rocks tends to go down every year at some point you will need to buy a rock to pay your friend back because they keep getting cheaper it costs less to buy the payback rock the longer you wait replace a dollar with a rock in the example and you have your answer this is known as the time value of money in reality this is priced into the loan via the interest rate because the lender very much understands the math going on here also it is more complicated because the longer you delay payment the more interest you pay if you will so it does n't usually work to your advantage unless they underpriced the loan 's interest rate

below i will try to explain two most common binomial option pricing models used first of all splits time to expiry into n equal sub periods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion so the value of an option in any sub period is a function of its possible values in the following sub period therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through sub periods to current time there is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a single period here are two ways of doing this first of all let 's summarize your information current share price vs = $ 70 strike or exercise price x = $ 60 risk free rate r = 5.5 or time to maturity t = 12 months downward movement in share price for the period d = $ 65 $ 70 = upward movement in share price for the period u = = = u can be translated to $ multiplying by vs = > $ 70 = $ which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time if you need more clarification here the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk but because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this you probably do n't have to bother too much about it yet intrinsic value just in case someone reading this is unclear the value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise strike price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity this is also called an intrinsic value   note that american option can be exercised prior to it 's maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise but the value of an option at period 0 also called option price is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it so say with a strike of $ 60 and share price of $ 70 the intrinsic value is $ 10 whereas if share price was $ 50 the intrinsic value would be $ 0 the option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed   so we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable and respectively = $ = $ 5 remember if strike was $ 70 then would be $ 0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money = $ = $ 1 setting up a hedge ratio   h = h = 5 = 1 that means we have to write sell 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks you can make a simple calculation to check this but i 'm not going to go into too much detail here as the is not about hedging because this position is risk free in equilibrium it should pay a risk free rate 5.5 then the formula to price an option vc using the hedging approach is vs where vc is the value of the call option h is the hedge ratio vs current share price highest probable share price r risk free rate t time in years value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price therefore solving for vc 70 = 1 = > = 60 = > = = > vc = 70   which is similar to the formula given in your textbook so i must assume that using would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above then it is easy to find that vc = ~ $ 2 risk neutral valuation another way to calculate vc is using a risk neutral approach we first introduce a variable p which is a risk neutral probability of an increase in share price p = d so in your case p = = therefore using p the vc would be equal vc = = > vc = = > vc = ~ $ as you can see it is very close to the hedging approach i hope this answers your questions also bear in mind that there is much more to the option pricing than this the most important topics to cover are multi period accounting for dividends black scholes merton option pricing model

equity does not represent production divisions in a company i.e. chocolate strawberry and vanilla does not make sense   in sole proprietorship equity represents 1 owner   in partnership equity has at least two sub accounts namely partner 1 and partner 2   in corporations equity may have common stockholders and preferred stockholders or even different class of shares for insiders and angel investors   as you can see equity represents who owns the company it is not what the company does or manufactures   first and foremost define the boundary of the firm are your books titled the books of the family of doe the books of mr mrs doe or the books of mr mrs doe sons   ask yourself who owns this family if you believe that a marriage is perpetual until further notice then it does not make any sense to constantly calculate which parent owns the family more in partnership firm profits are attributed to partner 's accounts using previously agreed ratio for example because partner 1 is more hard working and valuable to the firm   does your child own this family does he she have any rights to use the assets to earn income from the assets to transfer the assets to others or to enforce private property rights if they do n't have a part of these rights they are certainly not part of equity   so what happens to the expenses of children if you follow the partnership model there are two ways the first way is to attribute the loss to the parents family since you do not expect the children to repay it is an unrecoverable loss written off the second way is to create a account to aggregate all child expense then create a separate book called the books children 1 and classify the expense in that separate book   i advise using the family of doe as the firm 's boundary and having 1 equity account to simplify everything it is ultimately up to you to decide the boundaries

yes you tell them   i can say that i pay cash for all my cars and always get cars for lower than the low end   there are basically two steps go test drive negotiate fully leave unless you are given a mind blowing offer   this may take you one to many dealerships   it depends on how well you know what car you want and how much a dealership will negotiate    you pick a night that another dealership that specifically has the car you want or multiple even better is open and you go in 30 45 mins before they close    paying cash is key for this to work   by the time you get to numbers they will be almost closed   their finance guy might be gone so you will get your salesman and a manager   i will use my last car as an example   toyota 2015 with   at with a good deal at   i simply talked to my sales guy said i would like to walk out with the car tonight   i have already talked to xyz dealership and they offered me which is already below low price    i asked for $   boom 10 minutes later car bought at cash is king   the sales guy and manager will bite the bullet on profit for ease of sale   going in late is the key to using the cash   you do n't have the finance guys jumping in and you have less people to move through   also they know they have limited time to deal and if you walk off the lot there is less than 10 chance of you coming back they want to close   they are making minimal profit but doing minimal work   with cash your sales guy is on your side because you are basically throwing him a couple hundred dollars at the end of a shift where most would just be sitting around watching tv some other tips be fair   if they would have said is our lowest that we can go and that 's it   i probably would have still got the car   dealerships will tell you their lowest price if you are close and you are still below it since they did n't show me their lowest price i did n't budge much but still a bit to show good sport    they brought their invoice number out to show that at that they were going to lose $ 1500 on the car   i made the manager laugh because my response was to bring up kbb and show the used car price for the car which was minus $ 2000   so i just said well you lost $ 1500 but i lose $ 2000 driving this off the lot   i then went back to $ to meet in the middle of losing money   this actually closed the deal   anyway do n't ever believe any piece of paper they show you with numbers   these dealerships get monthly bonuses on sales and that is a lot of their profit past selling your trade in if you actually value your money you would never be trading in a car to a dealer so if you are paying cash sell your own car or at least take it to a place like carmax which i do n't endorse but better than dealer

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

in the case of an initial public offering the brokers underwriting the share issue will look at the current earnings being generated by the company and compare these to those of other competitor companies already listed in the stock market   for example if a new telephone company is undertaking an initial public offering then the share price of those telephone companies which are already traded on the stock market will serve as a reference for how much investors will be willing to pay for the new company 's shares   if investors are willing to pay 15 times earnings for telecom shares then this will be the benchmark used in determining the new share price in addition comparative growth prospects will be taken into account   finally the underwriter will want to see a successful sale so they will tend to slightly under price the new shares in order to make them attractive none of this is an exact science and we often see shares trading at a large premium to the initial offer price during the first few days of trading   more often that not prices then settle down to something closer to the offer price   the initial price spike is usually the result of high demand for the shares by investors who believe that past examples of a price spike will repeat with this initial public offering   there will also usually be high demand for the new shares from funds that specialise in shares of the type being issued in the case of a rights issue where an existing publicly traded company wishes to raise capital by issuing new shares the company will price the new shares at a significant discount to the current market price   the new shares will be initially offered to existing shares holders and the discounted price is intended to encourage the existing shareholders to exercise their rights since the new shares may have the effect of diluting the value of their shares   any shares which are not purchased by existing share holder will then be offered for sale in the market

here 's a different take   look through the lists of companies   that offer shareholder perks here 's one from hargreaves lansdown   see if you can find one that you already spend money with with a low required shareholding where the perks would actually be usable   note that in your case being curious about the whole thing and based in london you do n't have to rule out the agm based perks unlike me my reason for this is simple with 3 out of 4 of the companies we bought shares in directly all for the perks we 've made several times the dividend in savings on money we would have spent anyway either with the company in which we bought shares or a direct competitor   this means that you can actually make back the purchase price plus dealing fee quite quickly probably in in our case and you still have the shares we 've found that pub restaurant hotel brands work well if you use them or their equivalents anyway caveats it 's more enjoyable than holding a handful of shares in a company you do n't care about and if you want to read the annual reports you can relate this to your own experience which might interest you given your obvious curiosity

you also may want to consider how this interacts with the stepped up basis of estates   if you never sell the stock and it passes to your heirs with your estate under current tax law the basis will increase from the purchase price to the market price at the time of transfer    in a comment you proposed    thinking more deeply though i am a little skeptical that it 's a free lunch say i buy stock a a computer manufacturer at $ 100 which i intend to hold long term it ends up falling to $ 80 and the robo advisor sells it for tax loss harvesting buying stock b a similar computer manufacturer as a replacement so i benefit from realizing those losses however say both stocks then rise by 50 over 3 years at this point selling b gives me more capital gains tax than if i had held a through the losses since a 's rise from 80 back to 100 would have been free for me since i purchased at 100 and then later thought   although thinking even more sorry thinking out loud here i guess i still come out ahead on taxes since i was able to deduct the $ 20 loss on a against ordinary income and while i pay extra capital gains on b that 's a lower tax rate so the free lunch is $ of tax bracket capital gains rates that 's true   and in addition to that if you never sell b which continues to rise to $ 200 was last at $ 120 after a 50 increase from $ 80 the basis steps up to $ 200 on transfer to your heirs    of course your estate may have to pay a 40 tax on the $ 200 before transferring the shares to your heirs   so this is n't exactly a free lunch either   but you have to pay that 40 tax regardless of the form in which the money is held   cash real estate stocks whatever   whether you have a large or small capital gain on the stock is irrelevant to the estate tax    this type of planning may not matter to you personally but it is another aspect of what wealth management can impact

answers 1 is this a good idea is it really risky what are the pros and cons yes it is a bad idea i think with all the talk about employer matches and tax rates at retirement vs. now that you miss the forest for the trees it 's the taxes on those retirement investments over the course of 40 years that really matter example imagine $ 833 per month $ 10k per year invested in xyz fund for 40 years when you retire the fund happens to make 10 per year over that time and you 're taxed at 28 how much would you have at retirement 2 is it a bad idea to hold both long term savings and retirement in      the same investment vehicle especially one pegged to the us stock      market yes keep your retirement separate and untouchable it 's supposed to be there for when you 're old and unable to work co mingling it with other funds will induce you to spend it i really need it for that house i can always pay more into it later it also can create a false sense of security look at how much i 've got i got that new car covered so send 10 into whatever retirement account you 've got and forget about it save for other goals separately   3 is buying spy a set it and forget it sort of deal or would i need      to rebalance selling some of spy and reinvesting in a safer vehicle      like bonds over time for a retirement account yes you would that 's the advantage of target date retirement funds like the one in your 401k they handle that and you do n't have to worry about it think about it do you know how to age your account and what to age it into and by how much every year no offense but your next question is what an etf is 4 i do n't know anything about etfs things to consider know read start here 5 my company plan is retirement goal focused which according to      fidelity means that the asset allocation becomes more conservative      over time and switches to an income fund after the retirement      target date 2050 would i need to rebalance over time if holding      spy answered in 3 6 i 'm pretty sure that contributing pretax to 401k is a good idea      because i wo n't be in the 28 tax bracket when i retire how are the      benefits of investing in spy outweigh paying taxes up front or do      they not partially answered in 1 note that it 's that 4 decades of tax free growth that 's the big dog for winning your retirement company matches if you get one are just a bonus and the fact that contributions are tax free is a cherry on top 7 please comment on anything else you think i am missing i think what you 're missing is that winning at personal finance is easy and winning at personal finance is hard

on my recent visit to the bank i was told that money coming into the nre account can only be foreign currency and for nro accounts the money can come in local currency but has to be a valid source of income e.g. rent or investments in india yes this is correct as per regulation in india now if we use 3rd party remittances like or transferwise etc they usually covert the foreign currency into local currency like inr and then deposit it the remittance services are better suited for transferring funds to normal savings accounts of your loved ones most remittance services would transfer funds using a domestic clearing network and hence the trace that funds originated outside of india is lost there could be some generic remittance that may have direct tie up with some banks to do direct transfers how can we achieve this in either nre nro accounts if not what are the other options you can do a wire transfer swift from us to indian nre account you can also use the remittance services if available from banks where you hold nre account for example from hdfc for an nre account in hdfc or from icici for an nre account in icici or from sbi etc these would preserve the history that funds originated from outside india similarly you can also deposit a foreign currency check into indian bank account the funds would take around month or so to get credited all other funds can be deposited in nro account

to keep it simple i will keep the focus between a trad ira and a normal taxable account roth 's and 401(k add more complications that make another problem   i will also assume based on the question that you are n't able to deduct the ira contributions also a roth is better in every way than a non deductible trad ira so the backdoor roth mentioned in other answers is probably the way to go and this is more of an academic exercise   ok so why bother with the ira if you 're taxed anyway   because you are n't taxed as you go with a normal non tax advantaged account you have to pay taxes every year on any realized capital gains and dividends including fund distributions because of the compounding nature of savings delaying paying taxes is in your best interest   simple example   taxable account ira account now this is a very simplified example if you 're more tax conscious i.e. more buy and holding you can delay paying some of the long term cap gains in the taxable account but any short term cap gains including distributions from the underlying funds will be at your marginal income tax rate   a few other observations edit i set up a spreadsheet where each year i deposited $ 1000 for 35 years each year the balance in the ira account grows by 5 but the taxable only by 0.15 = 4.25 due to the effect of taxes at the end of 35 years my simulation assumes you pay 15 on all the gains in the ira which would likely not be the case but easier than forecasting through retirement and demonstrates what i 'm trying to show here 's plot showing the balance in the various accounts the blue is the ira account orange the taxable account and grey is the effective balance of the ira after paying taxes on the gains    and here 's a plot of the advantage of the ira after paying taxes on the gains vs the taxable account   whether that 's worth it to you or anyone depends on some the assumptions in the simulation especially effective tax rates and growth rates as well as any personal issues some people may be less likely to raid an ira account for example than a normal account conversely if you have a project coming up you may need something a bit more liquid than an ira

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

it 's difficult to provide an exact answer as this will very much depend on the bank the local regulatory scheme   however as a business owner you should be able to provide incorporation docs some proof of ownership of the company and last years financial statements or tax returns many banks would accept this as a proof of income for the purposes of granting credit in general in most jurisdictions i can think of a high downpayment will not remove the need to verify income as the bank needs to feel comfortable that you have the ability to pay the remaining 25 e.g. how do they know you 're not a serially unemployed lottery winner and if the downpayment is quite large they may want some assurance that you got the money legally e.g. how do they make sure you 're not a drug dealer so probably regardless of how large a downpayment most banks would probably want some additional proofs of income however what proofs are needed may be more flexible than just a salary stub i suggest taking a look at what sort of documents you may have on hand that can serve to validate your revenue in some way and contacting a few banks directly to see what options they can provide and whether some custom tailored arrangement can be made

this is a bit unusual but not unheard of i have known more than one car whose owner was not its driver   besides the obvious risk that the legal owner of the car will repossess it this seems fairly safe   your insurance should cover any financial liability that you incur during an accident   even if the car is repossessed by the owner you are only out the registration fees i would suggest you avoid looking this gift horse in the grill   her father on the other hand might be in for some drama and financial mess if he has a falling out with his friend this arrangement reminds me of where one spouse owns the car but the other drives it and pays the loan   usually when the relationship goes south one spouse is forced to sell the car at a loss

the hmrc has a dedicated self help learning site that is helpful here it 's important to tell hmrc that you are self employed as soon as    possible   if you do n't you may have to pay a penalty   you do n't want to pay more to hmrc than you have to as it is a waste    of your money your business has started when you start to advertise or you have a    customer to buy your goods or services   it is at this point that your business is trading you can not    register before you start trading for example if you advertise your business in the local newspaper on    15 january but do not get your first customer until 29 march in this    case you have been trading since 15 january you must tell hmrc within six months of the end of the tax year in    which you start self employment   you must therefore register by 5 october   but it 's best to register well before this so that you do not forget    to do so the hmrc also has a youtube channel with help videos and am i trading or not might be of particular interest to you most of the registration is based around the concept of starting to work with the intent to make a profit by the letter of law and regulations you should register within six months of the end of the tax year you started to avoid any potential penalty however note that the situation is different based upon your intent if you begin making putting up videos online as a hobby with the hope that you can make something to help you the basic costs involved and the total amount you make is relatively small say less than 500 pounds you will not be classified as trading and likely have no need to register with hmrc   as soon as you begin to get in regular payments maybe a single payment of a significant size or multiple payments for a similar service item you are vastly more likely to need to register from my reading you would likely be safe to begin putting up videos without registration but if you begin spending a large portion of your time over an extended period multiple months and/or begin getting payments of any notable size then you should likely register with the appropriate services hmrc etc as is the case in both the usa and uk simple registration is pretty cheap and the costs of little no income are usually pretty minor   also note that the hmrc trading and self employment regulations are unusual compared to many us laws institutions in that you are explicitly permitted to begin doing something and only register later so if you start doing videos for an entire tax year + 5 months and make nothing significant you 'd seemingly be fine to never register at all

do n't start by investing in a few individual companies this is risky want an example i 'm thinking of a big company say $ 120 billion or so a household name and good consistent dividends to boot they were doing fairly well and were generally busy trying to convince people that they were looking to the future with new environmentally friendly technologies then they went and spilled a bunch of oil into the gulf of mexico yes it was n't a pretty picture if bp was one of five companies in your portfolio that day things would look a lot better if they were one of 500 or 5000 companies though so first aim for diversification via mutual funds or etfs i personally think you should probably start with the mutual funds you avoid trading fees for one thing it 's also easier to fit medium sized dollar amounts into funds than into etfs even if you do get fee free etf trading etfs can get you better expense ratios but the less money you have invested the less important that is once you have a decent sized portfolio tens of thousands of dollars or so then you can begin to consider holding stocks of individual companies take note of fees including trading fees commissions if you buy $ 2000 worth of stock and pay a $ 20 commission you 're already down 1 if you 're holding a mutual fund or etf look at the expense ratio the annualized real return on the stock market is about 4 a real return is after adjusting for inflation if your fee is 1 that 's about a quarter of your earnings which is huge and while it 's easy for a mutual fund to outperform the market by 1 from time to time it 's really really hard to do it consistently once you 're looking at individual companies you should do a lot of obnoxious boring stupid research and do n't just buy the stock on the strength of its brand name you 'll be interested in a couple of metrics the main one is probably the p e ratio price earnings if you take the inverse of this you 'll get the rate at which your investment is making you money e.g. a p e of 20 is 5 a p e of 10 is 10 all else being equal a lower p e is a good thing it means that you 're buying the company 's income really cheap however all else is seldom equal if a stock is going for really cheap it 's usually because investors do n't think that it 's got much of a future earnings are not always consistent there are a lot of other measures like beta correlation to the market overall riskier volatile stocks have higher numbers gross margins price to unleveraged free cash flow and stuff like that again do the boring research otherwise you 're just playing games with your money

i think your premise is slightly flawed every investment can add or reduce risk depending on how it 's used if your ordering above is intended to represent the probability you will lose your principal then it 's roughly right with caveats if you buy a long term government bond and interest rates increase while you 're holding it its value will decrease on the secondary markets if you need want to sell it before maturity you may not recover your principal and if you hold it you will probably be subject to erosion of value due to inflation inflation and interest rates are correlated over the short term the stock market can be very volatile and you can suffer large paper losses but over the long term decades the stock market has beaten inflation but this is true in aggregate so if you want to decrease equity risk you need to invest in a very diversified portfolio index mutual funds and hold the portfolio for a long time with a strategy like this the stock market is not that risky over time derivatives if used for their original purpose can actually reduce volatility and therefore risk by reducing both the upside and downside of your other investments for example if you sell covered calls on your equity investments you get an income stream as long as the underlying equities have a value that stays below the strike price the cost to you is that you are forced to sell the equity at the strike price if its value increases above that the person on the other side of that transaction loses the price of the call if the equity price does n't go up but gets a benefit if it does in the commodity markets southwest airlines used derivatives options to buy at a fixed price in the future on fuel to hedge against increases in fuel prices for years this way they added predictability to their cost structure and were able to beat the competition when fuel prices rose even had fuel prices dropped to zero their exposure was limited to the pre negotiated price of the fuel which they 'd already planned for on the other hand if you start doing things like selling uncovered calls you expose yourself to potentially infinite losses since there are no caps on how high the price of a stock can go so it 's not possible to say that derivatives as a class of investment are risky per se because they can be used to reduce risk i would take hedge funds as a class out of your list you ca n't generally invest in those unless you have quite a lot of money and they use strategies that vary widely many of which are quite risky

the best way i know of to get the interest rate lowered is to call the credit card company and simply ask typically if a credit card company thinks you will leave them for another company they will be willing to work with you   there is also the option of transfering some of the higher interest debt to one of the lower interest credit cards it sounds like you have your friend on the right track by focusing all extra money on the credit card with the highest interest rate then after that one is paid off send all extra to the next highest one and so on   the classic snowball effect

ordinarily a cosigner does not appear on the car 's title thus no ownership at all in the vehicle but they are guaranteeing payment of the loan if the primary borrower does not make the payment you have essentially two options stop making payments for him   if he does not make them the car will be repossessed and the default will appear on both his and your credit   you will have a credit ding to live with but he will to and he wo n't have the car continue to make payments if he does not to preserve your credit and sue him for the money you have paid   in your suit you could request repayment of the money or have him sign over the title ownership to you if you would be happy with either option   i suspect that he will object to both so the judge is going to have to decide if he finds your case has merit if you go with option 1 and he picks up the payments so the car is n't repossessed you can then still take option 2 to recover the money you have paid   be prepared to provide documentation to the court of the payments you have made bank statements showing the out go or other form of evidence you made the payment the finance company 's statements are n't going to show who made them

pay off the credit cards   from now on pay off the credit cards monthly   under no circumstances should you borrow money   you have net worth but no external income   borrowing is useless to you    $ 200,000 in two bank accounts because if one bank collapses you want to have a spare while you wait for the government to pay off the guarantee   keep $ 50,000 in checking and another $ 50k in savings   the remainder put into cds   do n't expect interest income beyond inflation   real interest rates after inflation are often slightly negative    people ask why you might keep money in the bank rather than stocks bonds   the problem is that stocks bonds do n't always maintain their value much less go up   the bank money wo n't gain but it wo n't suddenly lose half its value either   it can easily take five years after a stock market crash for the market to recover   you do n't want to be withdrawing from losses    some people have suggested more bonds and fewer stocks   but putting some of the money in the bank is better than bonds   bonds sometimes lose money like stocks   instead park some of the money in the bank and pick a more aggressive stock bond mixture   that way you 're never desperate for money and you can survive market dips   and the stock bond part of the investment will return more at 70/30 than 60/40    $ 700,000 in stock mutual funds   $ 300,000 in bond mutual funds   look for broad indexes rather than high returns   you need this to grow by the inflation rate just to keep even   that 's $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a year   keep the balance between 70/30 and   you can move half the excess beyond inflation to your bank accounts   that 's the money you have to spend each year   do n't withdraw money if you are n't keeping up with inflation    do n't try to time the market   much better informed people with better resources will be trying to do that and failing   play the odds instead   keep to a consistent strategy and let the market come back to you   if you chase it you are likely to lose money    if you do n't spend money this year you can save it for next year   anything beyond $ 200,000 in the bank accounts is available for spending   in an emergency you may have to draw down the $ 200,000   be careful   it 's not as big a cushion as it seems because you do n't have an external income to replace it    i live in southern california but would like to move overseas after establishing stable investments    i am not the type of person that would invest in mcdonald 's but would consider other less evil franchises maybe    these are contradictory goals as stated   a franchise meaning a local business of a national brand is not a stable investment   a franchise is something that you actively manage   at minimum you have to hire someone to run the franchise   and as a general rule they are n't as turnkey as they promise    how do you pick a good manager   how will you tell if they know how the business works   particularly if you do n't know   how will you tell that they are honest and wo n't just your money   or more honestly give you too much of the business revenues such that the business is not sustainable   or spend so much on the business that you ca n't recover it as revenue    some have suggested that you meant brand or stock rather than franchise   if so you can ignore the last few paragraphs   i would be careful about making moral judgments about companies   mcdonald 's pays its workers too little   google privacy   exxon is bad for the environment   chase collects fees from people desperate for money   tesla relies on government subsidies   every successful company has some way in which it can be considered evil   and unsuccessful companies are evil in that they go out of business leaving workers customers and investors i.e. you in the    regardless you should invest in broad index funds rather than individual stocks   if college is out of the question then so should be stock investing   it 's at least as much work and needs to be maintained    in terms of living overseas dip your toe in first   rent a small place for a few months   find out how much it costs to live there   remember to leave money for bigger expenses   you should be able to live on $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 a year now   then you can plan on spending $ 35,000 a year to do it for real including odd expenses that do n't happen every month   make sure that you have health insurance arranged    eventually you may buy a place   if you can find one that you can afford for something like $ 100,000   note that $ 100,000 would be low in california but sufficient even in many places in the us   think rural like the south or midwest   and of course that would be more money in many countries in south america africa or southern asia   even southern and eastern europe might be possible   you might even pay a bit more and rent part of the property   in the us this would be a duplex or a bed and breakfast   they may use different terms elsewhere    given your health do you need a maid cook   that would lean towards something like a bed and breakfast where the same person can clean for both you and the guests   same with cooking although that might be a second person or more   hire a bookkeeper accountant first as you 'll want help evaluating potential purchases   keep the business small enough that you can actively monitor it    part of the problem here is that a million dollars sounds like a lot of money but is n't   you are n't rich   this is about bare minimum for surviving with a middle class lifestyle in the united states and other first world countries   you ca n't live like a tourist    it 's true that many places overseas are cheaper   but many are n't including much of europe japan australia new zealand etc   and the ones that are n't may surprise you   and you also may find that some of the things that you personally want or need to buy are expensive elsewhere   dabble first and commit slowly be sure first   include rarer things like travel in your expenses    long term there will be currency rate worries overseas   if you move permanently you should certainly move your bank accounts there relatively soon perhaps keep part of one in the us for emergencies that may bring you back   and move your investments as well   your return may actually improve although some of that is likely to be eaten up by inflation   a 10 return in a country with 12 inflation is a negative real return    try to balance your investments by where your money gets spent   if you are eating imported food put some of the investment in the place from which you are importing   that way if exchange rates push your food costs up they will likely increase your investments at the same time   if you are buying stuff online from us vendors and having it shipped to you keep some of your investments in the us for the same reason   make currency fluctuations work with you rather than against you    i do n't know what your circumstances are in terms of health   if you can work you probably should   given twenty years your million could grow to enough to live off securely   as is you would be in trouble with another stock market crash   you 'd have to live off the bank account money while you waited for your stocks and bonds to recover

imo the right path usually depends on how long you depend on staying in the home and how much you put down the idea behind paying the higher rate is that you can easily recoup $ 0.25 35 on the dollar in taxes if you go with the higher rate at least for the first few years but that benefit becomes less valuable over time as you pay more interest in the beginning of the loan it 's a good deal in many cases as the trend over the last few years is to put 5 or less down and most people stay in homes for around 7 years in your case you are putting down a substantial down payment and with only 4 years to 80 ltv or less if the market improves taking the lower rate with pmi makes more sense

interesting question    how is social security funded the social security system works by using current payroll taxes as funding to pay benefits to retirees   historically there was always more money coming in then what was being paid out in benefits   this changed at the beginning of march 2010 when social security started paying out more than it was taking in this article estimates the exact date to be around march 3 or march 4 the chart below has the approximate date highlighted with the red circle   due to the baby boomer generation it is estimated that social security will now be perpetually in the red unless changes are made   the recent reduction in payroll taxes will not help social security solvency   what was done with all the extra money social security collected over the last three decades the social security trust fund sstf was required to purchase special issue us government bonds with the excess funds   the sstf was essentially purchasing us government debt with the excess funds   this allowed congress to spend the excess funds   the special issue funds are different then normal us treasuries in that the sstf can redeem special issue bonds at face value at any time even before maturity   the sstf is currently holding $ 2.5 trillion of these special issue bonds as assets   what next hell if i know   the sstf was a major purchaser of us debt over the last few decades to the tune of $ 2.5 trillion   that changed in 2010   the sstf is no longer purchasing us debt at the same time the us government is issuing record amounts of debt   the sstf could begin redeeming its bonds to meet payment obligations   when it the bonds the us treasury must cough up the funds   where is it the us government going to get the money especially when it is currently borrowing money at record levels i read many articles that say that we do n't have to count sstf bond holdings as debt since we owe it to ourselves   that always makes me chuckle   the us government owes the sstf $ 2.5 trillion   i 'm not the us government so do n't count me in the we part of we owe it to ourselves   i 'm also fairly certain i will never see a dime of social security so do n't count me in the ourselves portion either charts were obtained from here

inherent or intrinsic value aside from the term 's use with regards to options markets   every time i tell someone i 've invested in bitcoin they tell me that it is silly because there is no inherent or intrinsic value in bitcoin   but what is the intrinsic value of paper with a federal seal on it what is the intrinsic value of a component that could be but does n't have to be used in computer parts gold    my favorite question of all to show the silliness of intrinsic value is to ask what is the intrinsic value of water    to someone and dying of thirst in a desert i 'm quite certain that faced with death they 'd be willing to part with an for the water if anything to simply survive   on the other hand what is the value of water to someone drowning i would think it actually has a quite negative value and they 'd be more than happy to see the water gone even going so far as to part with an   to make an argument that water has an intrinsic value is to say that the word value is n't subjective when it very clearly is in both cases where water is needed and not wanted one would feasibly be willing to pay a very extreme cost the removal of an in order to both have or be rid of water   all this said it would appear that intrinsic value means i 'm trying to make an objective point about a subjective value even if you were to try to make the case that water had some sort of baseline or average value with regards to supporting mankind and that this was intrinsic it would additionally be irrelevant because the definition of supporting mankind is subjective do we just use just enough water to keep men and women alive across the world without regards to health do we count children as half men do we count a non active 50 year old female 's water needs as highly as an active 16 year old male 's what about with regards to evaporation and we do n't know the weather or climate changes in store so in case of famine should we consider enough water to last 3 days 3 weeks or 3 years   no i 'm afraid the only way to really consider what is the value of water is to drop this silly notion of intrinsic value and realize that water is worth merely what someone is willing to pay for it and so my argument would go is bitcoin

the answer depend nearly 100 on how the offer and contingency read when i have a client make an offer the contingency includes an inspection but the buyer would have no obligation to accept a counter offer i.e. the offer can be withdrawn due to i did n't like the inspection report and do not wish to negotiate any repairs in fact the buyer need not disclose which fault was the cause the buyer pays for the inspection and the report is his property   on the other hand i agree if it 's only radon the fix is common and you may be paying for many inspections only to find one house after another with this issue

credit is very important even if you are wealthy one thing you may not realize is that rich people typically have comparatively little cash on hand   if they 're smart most of their assets are not liquid they 're tied up in safe long term investments   they use credit for their day to day expenses and pay it off from the dividends on their investments which might only come in once a quarter there are also tax advantages to using credit   if a rich person wanted a new car he 'd be smarter leasing it for his business immediate write off of the lease payments on taxes versus buying it depreciation over several years plus property tax liability in some states   there are more elaborate tax but the point is that buying a car outright is the worst option in terms of tax avoidance another way the rich mis use credit is so that they do n't risk their own money on business ventures   let 's say i have $ 1,000,000 in my personal bank account and i want to buy a business that costs $ 1m.   if i am dumb i clean out my bank account and put all my money in the business   i get 100 of the profits but i also bear 100 of the risk   if i 'm smart i loan 200 k of my own money in the business and put the rest someplace safe and get a loan from a bank for the other   if the business succeeds the bank gets their money back plus interest   if it fails the business declares bankruptcy and the bank eats the 800k loss if i structured the debt right my personal loan to the failed business gets paid back first when the company is liquidated and the bank gets whatever is left over if anything   the most of my own money i can possibly lose is 200k and probably it 's closer to zero if i have a good accountant

the flaw in your reasoning is that you are assuming that renting a house is easy and automatic who is going to manage the property your parents what are you going to do if the tenants burn the place down start having drug parties there or secretly have 6 cats who piss everywhere so noone will ever want to rent it again what are you going to do when the house goes for a year and you have to pay a year 's worth of mortgage payments with no rental income what are you going to do when some deadbeat decides to stop paying the rent but wo n't move out and when you try to evict him he goes to court to stop you you going to fly to nj to make the court appearances unless you sell your existing house or your parents buy you out then you need to stay you should not attempt to own two houses at once with one of the houses located not where you are at that will not turn out well also just as an aside 30-year mortgages are not an investment they are a way to lose money usually people get them because they want a big beautiful house that they can not afford so they borrow the money that is not investing that is wasting money to live in luxurious circumstances if you want to become wealthy buy a property you can afford not something that you have to string out payments for 30 years

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

your thinking is unfortunately incorrect an loan as opposed to interest only loans pay down or the principal with each payment this means that the amount that is owed at prepayment will always be less than the total borrowed and is also why some providers make a charge for prepayment the fairness arguments that you make predicated on that misunderstanding are therefore incorrect

okay but that 's about gold as an investment in today 's world and during   an extremely unstable financial situation   many other types of investments could be used similarly those who advocate gold as a hedge do n't advocate buying it during a crisis they advocate keeping some as part of an investment strategy but again that 's gold as gold not gold as currency   leveraging your investments based on current financial situations is what investing is about    gold as a medium for currency is a totally different thing    what you just described would be called arbitrage in moving markets or other situations i guess looking for no lose situations where you can trade things around and increase your net value doing it     it helps stabilize markets as people take advantage of this situation it counters the effect and self corrects think about it

leverage increase returns but also risks ie the least you can pay the greater the opportunity to profit but also the greater the chance you will be underwater leverage is given by the value of your asset the house over the equity you put down so for example if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k then the leverage is 5 another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin or percentage down payment so = 5 the return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage suppose the value of your house goes up by 10 had you paid your house in full your return would be 10 or however if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5 as above a 10 increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment a return of 50 or as i said your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage that is 10 return on the asset times your leverage of 5 = 50 this is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house what you borrowed from the bank remains the same regardless of whether the price of the house changed the problem is that the mechanism also works in reverse if the price of the house falls by 10 it means now you only have 10k equity if the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater giving you an incentive to default on your loan in summary borrowing tends to be a really good deal heads you win tails the bank loses or as happened in the us the taxpayer loses

try using technical analysis look at the charts and look for stocks that are uptrending the of an uptrend being higher highs and higher lows use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position below 20 and and crossing over about to turn back upwards or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices say between $ 10 and $ 12 for a while as the price approaches the $ 10 support and the stochastic is in oversold you would buy as the price rebounds off the $ 10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts back up as the price starts reaching the resistance at $ 12 with in overbought at above 80 you would look to sell and take profits if you were able to do short selling in the competition you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down there are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis so it may be a subject you could research further before the begins good luck

i have a couple other important considerations regarding external hsa accounts vs employer sponsored hsa accounts depending on your personal financial situation and goals some people like to use hsa accounts as an extra retirement account since the money can be withdrawn penalty free in retirement for non medical expenses and completely tax penalty free at any time for medical expenses if your intended use for the hsa account is an investment vehicle for retirement then you may find more use benefit out of an external provider that may provide more or better investment options than your employers hsa investment options there can be a lot of additional value in those extra investment options over greater periods of time another very important consideration for fica taxes fica includes social security medicare that i do n't believe was mentioned before for those earners who are under the maximum social security wage limit you are paying 6.2 of each paycheck into social security taxes as others have mentioned you can save this tax through your employer ’s plan if you set up the account to be funded pre tax from your paychecks however in doing so you are lowering your overall contributions into social security which may lower your social security benefits in your retirement years   if this is ultimately going to lower your ssa benefits in retirement then that is a big future cost that may steer you against the pre tax employer contributions think of social security as part of your retirement plan not as a tax but instead as an additional check you put away for yourself for retirement every month of course this is only an important consideration if ssa is still going to be around when you retire but let 's assume that it will be this is not an issue for higher earners earning well above the max ssa taxable wages there is no wage limit on the 1.45 medicare tax withholding 's and there is certainly no harm in saving medicare taxes because it will not affect future medicare benefits so for taxpayers earning well over the max ssa wages they will just save the 1.45 medicare taxes without affecting their ssa contributions and resulting retirement benefits   so again it all comes down to personal situations depending on your earnings and goals employer plan may or may not be the way to go   personally for my lower earning clients friends and family i tend to recommend that they do whatever they can to maximize their social security benefits in retirement so i would advise them to either use the external provider account or the employer plan but with post tax contributions so you do n't lower the ssa withholding 's but can still claim the income tax deduction on your tax return ymmv

as anecdotal experience we have a credit account in my name as offered by bank 's marketing before i could qualify by common rules for i have an account there for years so they knew my history and reliability dynamics i guess and my wife is subscribed as a secondary user to the same credit account with a separate card so we share the same limits e.g. max month usage overdraft and benefits bank 's discounts and bonuses when usage passes certain thresholds and it 's easier to gain these points together than alone so in the end maintenance of the card costs zero or close to that on most months while the card is in a program to get discounts from hundreds of shops and even offers a free or discounted airport lounge access in some places but the bonus program is just that benefits come and go as global economics changes e.g. we had free car assistance available for a couple of years but it is gone since last tariff update generally it is beneficial for us to do all transactions including rent etc via these two credit cards to the same account and then recharge its overdraft as salaries come in we have an up to 50 days period till 20th of next calendar month with no penalties on having taken the loans but if we ever did that then tens of yearly percents would kick in using the card(s for daily ops there is a play on building up the credit history as well while we do n't really need the loans to get from month to month it helps build an image in the face of credit organizations which can help secure e.g. favorable mortgage rates and other contract conditions which are out of pocket money range i 'd say it is not only a we against the system sort of game though as it sort of trains our own financial discipline every month we have a chance to go over our spendings to see what we did and so we more regularly think about it in the end so the bank probably benefits from dealing with more educated less random customers when it comes to the bigger loans regarding internet we tend to trust more to a debit card which we populate with pocket money sufficient for upcoming or already placed blocked transactions after all a malicious shop can not sip off thousands of credit money but only as much as you 've pre allocated there on debit

short answer no some of those automatic payments you 've agreed to presumably by signing a pad form are initiated in batch by the company whom you 're buying from phone company cable company etc so no the bank has no indication from one day to the next what is coming through   and the request goes from say your cable company to their merchant bank to your bank typically you have a monthly bill date which is fixed and they should have terms established when it is due   if a payment comes back nsf they can once but only for the same amount and i believe it is 14 days from the initial payment attempt   it makes it predictable and you 'd figure banks would clue in and start to predict for you when things may come out but strictly speaking your bank does n't know when or how much

i want to be a bit contrarian here it may be true that to rebuild credit it helps to have credit but it 's not the most important thing if your description of your wife 's history is correct the most important thing is to fix her tendency to spend out of control especially on get rich quick schemes she may well be on the way to fixing that but in those circumstances every source of credit is a temptation to spend why put that temptation in her way whatever tiny effect having a credit card has on her credit score will be wiped out if in six months time she suddenly maxes out that card and ca n't pay it off i do n't want to play credit counsellor and you should get some professional advice but her credit score will improve by itself if she   takes on no new debt pays off what she has and cuts up any credit cards she owns

yes you can use a post office box as a business address but not as an address for your registered agent   using your home address as the address of the business does not to my knowledge create a legal issue if you are sued   your home is a personal asset not one that belongs to the llc so it would not be subject to seizure or forfeiture as part of any lawsuit against the business itself every state requires an llc or corporation to have a registered agent which according to wikipedia is in united states business law a registered agent also known as a resident agent or statutory agent is a business or individual designated to receive service of process when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons you can be your own registered agent if you like   companies that provide incorporation services will usually offer to act as a registered agent for your new business for a fee but it 's really no big deal i would recommend that you go to the web site section about forming an llc and take a look at their resources to help you through this   you need to do it right so understand what you need to do for the state you live in and take your time   if you rush it and screw it up then you might regret it later i hope this helps good luck

gt;if you know that a company called toyota with no access to any retained earnings   okay we are talking at cross purposes here    i take it as axiomatic that speculative ventures by private actors is mostly a net good thing e.g. grocery stores buying produce before the customer has handed over the gold car makers designing and building cars before they have been paid for end to end etc even if a lot of them fail i take it as axiomatic that we would not have things like laptop computers and fresh oranges year round and non iron shirts without that kind of speculative investment    i also take it as axiomatic that such speculative investment could not would not exist without or publicly issued promissory notes e.g. i do not think anyone would ever have made the first laptop computer if doing so required directly handing previously acquired gold coins to everyone involved in the design and construction    a with no money but infinite time could have built his own macbook pro with display like everything else we have it was dug up out of the ground by people no stronger than you or i. all the functionality is just ingenuity and machining it 's just stuff dug up and re combined by people not necessarily smarter than anyone else the fact that it has been done by human beings means by definition that it can be done by human beings    ergo a could have done it could have placed a man on the moon or built himself a 60 tv or an ipod or a nuclear bomb or a ferrari or sent a satellite past the solar system anything at all we do n't have anything that he did n't have just ingenuity and whatever we dig up out of the ground    but more realistically the difference between us and is   we have a historical record and the accumulated ingenuity of millions of individual insights and   we have an economy based on credibility and promises that allows things to be invented tested and made before they are paid for   i suggest that it is axiomatic that for example ipads would not exist if physical gold had to change hands at every step of development and manufacturing before it could occur or at the instance of there is just no sane scenario where a product like that comes into existence without promises and speculative investment and loan guarantees    same with fresh lettuce in winter or plumbing or electricity or cable tv   you ca n't just trade a grain of gold for every gallon of water that comes out of your shower in real time to a wet bill collector or stick some gold in the cable jack for every minute of internet    someone is promising something without having produced it yet whether you paid in advance or they bill your the service later value has changed hands on credit and promises it 's not a sane proposition that every transaction be a closed loop pay as you go thing especially when you get into commercial transactions    the modern world would not exist without credit markets and credit markets can not exist without something like fractional reserve banking demanding that everyone instantly reconcile every value exchange with a physical transfer of gold or some such is not a sane proposition    would your cell phone company pay someone to follow you around and collect grains of gold for every call if so would that person in turn be followed by the cell tower owner and so on    offering to pay in advance does n't negate the conundrum they still have to provide service which may or may not be covered by your gram of gold it 's still a credit market no matter which way the faucet runs and a credit market means facto that more money is in circulation than has been printed

one problem with this plan is that the individual must have earned income to contribute to a roth ira if you have an infant unless she is the new baby or something like that there is probably no legitimate way for her to earn income if you own a business and have kids who are older you can employ them to do work for you but they must really do work and earn around the market rate for that work otherwise it is unlikely that they will be able to earn enough to fund an ira until they are teenagers when they are old enough to work you can match their earnings by contributing the same amount to a roth ira on their behalf but this will not give you the amount of contributions and growth time that you were counting on

one piece of information you did n't mention is how much you paid for the original home   if you hold onto that home for too long you will have to pay capital gains on the difference between sale price and original price this can be a ton of money thousands of dollars easily the rule is if you lived in a home for 2 out of the past 5 years you do n't have to pay the capital gains tax so   if you just moved you have 3 years to sell   perhaps as a compromise you can try renting it for 3 years and then selling it a few months before the deadline

your real question why is this not discussed more is intriguing i think the media are doing a better job bringing these things into the topics they like to ponder just not enough yet   you actually produced the answer to how are long term capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket so you understand how it works   i am a fan of bracket topping e.g. a young couple should try to top off their 15 bracket by staying with roth but then using pretax to not creep into 25 bracket   for this discussion 2013 numbers a blank return i.e. no schedule a no other income shows a couple with a gross $ being at the line it happens that $ 20 k is exactly the sum of their standard deduction and 2 exemptions   the last clean distribution of income data is from 2006 but since wages have n't exploded and inflation has been low it 's fair to say that from the $ representing the top 20 of earners it wo n't have many more than top 25 today so yes this is a great opportunity for most people   any married couple with under that $ figure can use this strategy to exploit your observation and step up their basis each year to littleadv objection i imagine an older couple grossing $ 75 k by selling stock with $ 10 k in lt gains just getting rid of the potential 15 bill at retirement no trading cost if a mutual fund just $ 20 or so if stocks   the more important point not yet mentioned even in a low cost 401(k a lifetime of savings results in all gains being turned in ordinary income and the case is strong for deposit to the match but no no more as this strategy would let 2/3 of us pay zero on those gains   to try to address the rest of your questions a bit the strategy applies to a small sliver of people 25 have income too high the bottom 50 or so have virtually no savings much of the 25 that remain have savings in tax sheltered accounts with the 2013 401(k limit of $ 17,500 a 40 year old couple can save $ 35,000 this easily suck in most of one 's long term retirement savings we can discuss demographics all day but i think this addresses your question if you add any comments i 'll probably address them via edits avoiding a long dialog below

short answer is to put the max 15 contribution into your espp long answer is that since you want to be saving as much as you can anyway this is a great way to force you to do it and pick up at least a 15 return every six months or however often your plan makes a purchase i say at least because sometimes an espp will give you the lower of the beginning or end period stock price and then a 15 discount off of that but check the details of your plan if you feel like your company 's stock is a good long term investment then hold onto the shares when purchased otherwise sell as soon as you get them and bank that 15 return

if you 're into math do this thought experiment consider the outcome x of a random walk process a stock does n't behave this way but for understanding the question you asked this is useful on the first day x = some integer on each subsequent day x goes up or down by 1 with probability 1/2 let 's think of buying a call option on x. a european option with a strike price of s that expires on day n if held until that day and then exercised if profitable would yield a value y = 0 this has an expected value e[y that you could actually calculate should be related to the binomial distribution but my probability statistics hat is n't working too well today the market value of that option on day k where 1 < k < n should be = which you can also actually calculate on day n = y. the value is known an american option if held until day k and then exercised if profitable would yield a value = 0   for the moment forget about selling the option on the market so the choices are either exercise it on some day k or letting it expire let 's say it 's day k =   if > = in the money then you have two choices exercise today or exercise tomorrow if profitable the expected value is the same both are equal to so you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere if < = s-1 out of the money the expected value is 0 whether you exercise today when you know it 's worthless or if you wait until tomorrow when the best case is if and goes up to s so the option is still worthless but if = s at the money here 's where it gets interesting if you exercise today it 's worth 0 if wait until tomorrow there 's a 1/2 chance it 's worth 0 and a 1/2 chance it 's worth 1 so the expected value is 1/2 therefore you should wait until tomorrow now let 's say it 's day k =   similar situation but more choices if > = you can either sell it today in which case you know the value = or you can wait until tomorrow when the expected value is also again you might as well exercise it now if < = you know the option is worthless if = s-1 it 's worth 0 today whereas if you wait until tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up or 0 if it goes down for a net expected value of 1/4 so you should wait if = s it 's worth 0 today whereas tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up or 0 if it goes down > net expected value of 1/2 so you should wait if = it 's worth 1 today whereas tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up or 1/2 if it goes down > net expected value of 1.25 so you should wait if it 's day k = and x[n-3 > = then e[y = and you should exercise it now or if x[n-3 < = then   but if x[n-3 = then there 's an expected value e[y of 3 + = if you wait until tomorrow vs. exercising it now with a value of 2 if x[n-3 = then e[y = 2 + = 1.25 vs. exercise value of 1 if x[n-3 = s then e[y = 1 + = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0 if x[n-3 = s-1 then e[y = 0.5 + = 0.25 vs. exercise value of 0 if x[n-3 = then e[y = 0.25 + = vs. exercise value of 0 in all 5 cases wait until tomorrow you can keep this up the formula is = + for n k > d > k when you should wait and see or 0 for d < = k when it does n't matter and the option is worthless or d for d > = n k when you should exercise the option the market value of the option on day k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait it should be possible to show that the expected value of an american option on x is greater than the expected value of a european option on x. the intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money the option should be exercised early   or sold something a european option does n't allow whereas if it is nearly at the money the option should be held whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money the option is definitely worthless as far as real securities go they 're not random walks or at least the probabilities are time varying and more complex but there should be analogous situations and if there 's ever a high probability a stock will go down it 's time to exercise sell an in the money american option whereas you ca n't do that with a european option edit what do you know the computation i gave above for the random walk is n't too different conceptually from the binomial options pricing model

as joe mentioned you can carry a balance on your credit card for some grace period typically 1 month you will not be charged any interest if you pay your balance at the end of the grace period i think of it as a way to get liquid for making purchases for example you want to make a large purchase but your funds are in some investment account which might take ~1 week to get to you you can use the credit card to make the purchase and use that grace period to move your money from investments to checking account and pay for your purchase without paying anything extra this helps you keep your money invested and not having to keep large amounts in checking savings account which does not generate any returns

source   business owner for 13 years   unfortunately you may be hard pressed to get that money back    you can try sending him to collections but at that point it often starts to cost   you more than what he owes you in my experience    in the worst instance i lost $ 2100 on a single invoice that i never received a dime for    nearly 20 hours of my time wasted for nothing   a bit of unsolicited advice   i 've found that when working on a service basis obtaining billing and payment info up front and taking a deposit makes sense    i take 1 hour 's worth of deposit and bill the rest after    not only does it verify the payment method works but it also gives you a way to confirm the customer 's ability to pay in the future   if the customer at this just walk away   it 's not worth the risk    as a business your goal is to make money in exchange for goods or services   if your customers do n't understand that and are n't willing to front a bit of money to secure your services you 'll likely going to lose time and money

offers usually have an expiration deadline as long as the signed offer is returned by the seller to the potential buyer before the expiration it is a valid contract the fact that the seller countered and his counter offer was n't accepted is irrelevant the buyer can void the offer as long as it is not yet accepted by notifying the seller in writing that the offer is null and void i 'm not a lawyer you should ask your real estate attorney to be sure but that is my understanding of the contract law

i 've worked in gyms for 9 years here 's a few things i 've seen are n't necessarily a terrible thing if you know that you are going to stay for a while just know the terms you 're signing up for   aggressive and relentless with the membership salesman do n't be afraid to put your own price out there and if you do n't get it walk away do n't want the super high sign up fee say you wo nt join unless that is gone or lower often these sign up fees are commissions for the salesman one time i had a guy slip me a $ 100 under the table to drop the sign up fee and monthly rate saving him at least $ 500 a year newer gyms because they will be more in a need of new memberships thus giving in to lower prices   you do n't want to sign a contract just say so you 'd be amazed how often someone gets out of signing a contract just because they asked and threatened not to join because of it   aware of annual fees a trend in the industry now is to have a super low membership dues but charge the member an annual gym improvement or rate guarantee fee with a buddy ask for a buddy discount if you sign up at the same time consider why you are joining a gym i 've seen it so often that someone joins a gym and then gets frustrated because they never use it because they were n't getting the results you wanted maybe your better off spending a little more and going to a private personal training studio or a group exercise studio independent are a hot now   ultimately it 's about you getting what you want out of it so do what is going to give you the best chance to get the results you want

does the money lending between us need to be reported in our tax    reports no will he be taxed more because of lending the money to me yes will i be taxed more because of borrowing the money from him no how shall we report it so as to minimize our taxes you can not what is reported on your tax returns is the income a loan is not an income so nothing gets reported however when you repay the loan assuming it has interest the lender has income the interest interest income is reported on schedule b of the regular tax return or in the case of non resident for tax purposes on line 9 of 1040nr it is taxed as ordinary income and since you 're both foreigners the lender should look into the treaty provisions that might be relevant generally it is not exempt from taxable income based on treaty exemptions for students which is only for earned income but there might be other rules in the treaty regarding interest income if there 's no fair market or higher interest then there 's assumed interest at the irs mandated rates which is considered a gift if it amounts to more than the yearly gift exemption the lender may be liable for gift tax depending on the lender 's and your status and again see treaties loan without an obligation to repay and without actual repaying will also be considered a gift for tax purposes if the lender has no intentions of having the loan repaid i.e. making a gift it will be better to pay your tuition bills instead of actually giving you the money tuition is exempt from gift tax talk to a cpa ea licensed in your state for a proper tax advice on this issue

i found the following on a stock to mutual conversion for insurance firms for ohio pulling from that link   any domestic stock life insurance corporation incorporated under a general law may become a mutual life insurance corporation and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock provided such plan a has been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such corporation b has been approved by a vote of stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock then outstanding at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose c has been approved by a majority of the policyholders voting at a meeting of policyholders called for the purpose each of whom is insured in a sum of at least one thousand dollars and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least one year prior to such meeting   and any stockholder who has to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the stockholders and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled may be ordered to do so by a decree of the court of common for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose and such decree may provide that upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation   since they successfully became a mutual insurance company i would guess that those stocks were acquired back by the company and are leftover from the conversion they would not represent an ownership in the company but might have value to a collector

if anyone could reliably pick winners they could make more money by investing in those winners than by selling their advice generally when someone sends you unsolicited hype about stocks that 's because they 're trying to pump the price up so they can dump their own shares before it collapses again also note that these days it 's remarkably easy to run the scam where you sell half your customers buy advice and the other half sell advice on the same stock each time some of the customers drop out in disgust half minus whoever decides to give you another chance and the rest pay you for the next iteration you can make a lot of money before you run out of suckers that all by itself is good reason to be skeptical about anyone who does n't publish their full history so it can be audited for such shenanigans

i can think of one major income source you did n't mention dividends   rather than withdrawing from your pension pot you can roll it over to a sipp invest it in quality dividend growth stocks then depending on your pension size withdraw only the dividends to live on the goal here is that you buy quality dividend growth stocks    this will mean you rarely have to sell your investments and can weather the ups and downs of the market in relative comfort while using the dividends as your income to live off of    the growth aspect comes into play when considering keeping up with inflation or simply growing your income    in effect companies grow the size of their dividend payments and you use that to beat the effects of inflation meanwhile you do get the benefit of principle growth in the companies you 've invested in    i do n't know the history of the uk stock market but the us market has averaged over 7 total return including dividends over the long term a typical dividend payout is not much better than your annuity option though 3 to 4 is probably achievable    although looking at the list of uk dividend champion list companies that have grown their dividend for 25 years continuous some of them have higher yields than that right now    though that might be a warning sign btw given all the legal changes around buy to lets recently increases stamp duty on purchase reduction in mortgage interest deduction increased paperwork burden due to right to rent laws etc you want to check this carefully to make sure you 're safe on forecasting your return

this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses the bold part is where you lose me this absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance   it just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute   nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50 of the gross proceeds of your $ 10,000 or whatever nominal amount of money you 're dealing with investment and return it all to you after a year   and no money manager will insure that the market wo n't decline hedge funds pe firms vc firms investment partnerships etc all basically run the way you 're describing again without your loss insurance   everyone 's money is pooled and investments are made   everyone shares the and everyone shares the losses   and to top it off the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund   all of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree because returns are calculated on net proceeds with enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund for the rest of us there are etfs and other extremely fee reasonable investment options   and if you do n't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you 're kidding yourself your first bullet point i 'll add that aside from skewing the manager 's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns i doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1 expense ratio on an etf   if you look at the s&p performance for 10 or 20 or however many years i 'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back   the bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains

best strategy that has worked for me is to remember first of all that you hardly ever need anything right now try this if you see something you want to buy leave it for at least two weeks better yet a month if after that time you have hardly thought about it then you almost certainly do n't need it but if you 've thought quite a lot about owning it and how it will be beneficial then perhaps it 's worth picking up you will probably find that a small percentage of things you 'd like to buy make it through that screening period

i really does depend on the bank here is a fairly typical page on interest calculations the key phrase is interest is calculated on each day 's final balance and paid monthly   so at the end of each day the amount of interest is calculated for that day based on how much is in the account at the end of the month the amount of interest for each day is and added to the account balance that calculation is extremely similar to duffbeer703 's compound monthly using the average balance for the month provided the account does n't have tiered interest rates and the balance does n't go negative the software that banks use is easily sophisticated enough to handle that kind of calculation your bank should be able to give you a statement of exactly how the interest is calculated

your asset mix should reflect your own risk tolerance   whatever the ideal answer to your question it requires you to have good timing not once but twice let me offer a personal example in 2007 the s&p hit its short term peak at or so as it tanked in the crisis a coworker shared with me that he went to cash on the way down selling out at about 1100 at the bottom or so i his brilliance sarcasm here and as it passed 1300 just 2 years later again mentions how he must be thrilled he doubled his money he admitted he was still in cash done with stocks so he was worse off than had he held on to his pre crash assets for sake of disclosure my own mix at the time was 100 stock that 's not a recommendation just a reflection of how my wife and i were invested   we retired early and after the 2013 excellent year moved to a mix closer to at any time a crisis hits and we have 5 6 years spending money to let the market recover if a long term decline occurs social security kicks in for us in 8 years   if my intent was n't 100 clear i 'm suggesting your long term investing should always reflect your own risk tolerance not some short term gut feel that disaster is around the corner

the mechanism of supply and demand is imperfect   producers do n't know exactly how many purchasers consumers for a good there are   some goods by their nature are in short supply and some are plentiful the process of price discovery is one where in a nominally free market producers and purchasers make offers and counter offers to assess what the price should be   as they do this the historical price changes usually floating around some long term average   as it goes up we experience inflation   as it goes down deflation however there is n't a fixed supply of producers and purchasers so as new ones arrive and old ones leave this too has an impact on supply and prices money either in electronic or physical form needs to be available to reflect the transactions and the economy most central banks at least in more established economies aim for inflation of 2 4 by controlling the availability of money and the cost of borrowing new money   there are numerous ways they can do this printing issuing bonds etc the reason one wants some degree of inflation is because employees will never accept a pay cut even when one would significantly improve the overall economy   companies often decrease their prices in order to match lower demand but employees do n't usually accept decreased wages for decreased labour demand a nominal degree of overall money inflation therefore solves this problem   employees who get a below inflation wage increase are actually getting a wage cut supply and demand must be matched and some inflation is the inevitable consequence of this

answer their questions as honestly as you can they should know that you are n't going to have the answer off hand to everything and that is ok   one way that you can cover yourself is to take photographs of everything that way if anything catastrophic does happen you will have something to show exactly how it was when the comes to do their estimates   hopefully you never need to use that but better to err on the side of caution the insurance company is n't all that important read reviews as mentioned in another answer   you can also look into multiple policy discounts   if your insurance provider for your auto insurance also offers homeowners policies they might also offer you a discount on one or both policies for grouping them   feel free to shop around and look for the best coverage at the best price   overall the most important thing is going to be a company that is easy to deal with   it is not worth saving a couple dollars a year to have insurance through somewhere that is going to make it a nightmare to make a claim in addition to answering all of their questions make sure that you have all of your own questions answered   depending on location you might want to ask if they cover hurricanes flooding other natural events etc   if you have any special items like collectibles jewelry expensive electronics firearms etc you might want to ask if that is covered of if you need a separate rider for those items

a company whose stock is available for sale to the public is called a publicly held or publicly traded company   a public company 's stock is sold on a stock exchange and anyone with money can buy shares through a stock broker this contrasts with a privately held company in which the shares are not traded on a stock exchange in order to invest in a private company you would need to talk directly to the current owners of the company finding out if a company is public or private is fairly easy   one way to check this is to look at the wikipedia page for the company   for example if you take a look at the apple page on the right sidebar you 'll see type public followed by the stock exchange ticker symbol aapl   compare this to the page for mars inc. on that page you 'll see type private and no stock ticker symbol listed another way to tell if you can find a quote for a share price on a financial site such as google finance or yahoo finance you can buy the stock   you wo n't find a stock price for mars inc. anywhere because the stock is not publicly traded

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

the sale of shares on vesting matters in a way similar to how reinvested dividends are taxed but the newly purchased fund shares basis has to be increased you need to be sure to have the correct per share cost basis it 's easy to confuse the total rsu purchase with the correct numbers only what remained   the vesting stock is a taxable event ordinary income   you then own the stock at that cost basis a sale after that is long or short term and the profit is the to extent it exceeds that basis   the fact that you got these shares in 2013 means you should have paid the tax then and this is part two of the process of course the partial sale means a bit of math to calculate the basis of what remained

note i am making a usa assumption here keep in mind this answer does n't necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the usa   you asked two questions i 'm looking to buy a property i do not want to take a risk on this    property its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live how    would i go about hedging against increasing interest rates to counter    the increasing mortgage costs to counter increasing interest rates obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer if that 's available   as far as costs for a mortgage that depends as mortgages are tied to the value of the property home   if you want a place to live a piece of property and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates a fixed mortgage would work for these goals ideally i 'd like to not lose money on my property seeing as i will be    borrowing 95 of the property 's value so i 'd like to hedge against    interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk    neutral position on my property now we have a different issue   for instance if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for $ 500,000 and the housing value plummeted 50 or more the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates but that does n't protect the property value   in addition to that if the person needed to move for a job that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss or move and rent and face some complications renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if they 'll be in an area for more than 5 10 years 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages 3 do n't want to pay property taxes varies by state homeowner 's insurance or maintenance costs 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before re signing a lease or looking for a new place to live   again other conditions can apply to people who favor renting such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a change of scenes and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective but these are smaller exceptions but with renting you have nothing to re sell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as throwing away money which is n't necessarily true but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting does n't go into an asset that can be re sold

i will solely address your fear because from what i read you fear investing in something that could possibly go down in the future   this is almost identical to market timing so let 's use the spy as an example   look at the spy on yahoo finance specifically in 2011   the market experienced a little bit of a pull back during the year and some analysts claimed that it would fall below 600 read this   in fact a co worker of mine said that he feared buying the s&p 500 in 2011 as well as in 2010 so he bought gold compare the two from 2011 to now to put it bluntly he experienced 50 less gain than i did did the s&p 500 ever fall below 600 in that timeframe or according to the linked analyst there were plenty of similar predictions then   no   if you avoid doing something because you 're afraid it could drop technically you should be just as afraid of it rising fear of losing everything vs. fear of missing out both are real   that 's not to say invest out of fear but that fear cuts both ways and generally we only look at it from one side retirement investing should be a boring automated process where ideally we do n't try and time the market though some will try and like in 2011 fail   if you ca n't help your fear you can always approach retirement investing with automated re balancing where you hold some money in less risky forms and others in higher risk forms and automate a rebalance every month or quarter

i understand the question i think the tough thing is that trades over the next brief time are random or appear so so just as when a stock is $ 10.00 bid $ ask if you place an order below the ask a tick down in price may get you a fill or if the next trades are flat to higher you might see the close at $ 10.50 and no fill as it never went down to your limit   this process is no different for options than for stocks   when i want to trade options i make sure the strike has decent volume and enter a market order edit i a bit to clarify the black scholes is a model not a rigid equation say i discover an option that 's underpriced but it trades under right until it expires it 's not like there 's a reversion to the mean that will occur there are some very sophisticated traders who use these tools to trade in some very high volumes for them it may produce results for the small trader you need to know why you want to buy a stock or its option and not worry about the last $ 0.25 of its price

so let 's talk about the nation scale which is what the equation savings = investments is referring to   in that context does an investment merely mean the purchase of a financial asset or an investment in some physical asset or productive capital i like to think of investment as building a factory developing land or spending money on r&amp;d. but in the economic sense merely transforming cash into a financial asset like treasuries is also considered investment correct as a matter of fact just merely leaving cash in a deposit account can technically be counted towards investment   am i understanding this correctly or am i fundamentally missing something

i work for a hedge fund not wealth management but i assume that client information is treated similarly it is a huge deal the company will probably need to formally investigate it and inform all the clients involved even if they can prove that no one looked at the information it 's going to make clients question the company 's procedures i could see it being a firing offense depending on how many clients were affected and the nature of the data sorry if that 's not what you wanted to hear

this is not your problem and you should not try to fix it if your employer paid money into someone else 's account instead of yours they should ask their bank to reverse it and should pay you your wages while they are waiting for this to be done no bank will let you do anything about money paid by someone else into an account that is not yours or give you details of someone else 's account

there are some good answers about the benefits of diversification but i 'm going to go into what is going on mathematically with what you are attempting i was always under the assumption that as long as two securities are less than perfectly correlated i.e. 1 that the standard deviation risk would be less than if i had put 100 into either of the securities while there does exist a minimum variance portfolio that is a combination of the two with lower vol than 100 of either individually this portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio with highest utility under your metric   your metric includes returns not just volatility variance so the different returns bias the result away from the min vol portfolio using the utility function results in the highest utility of 100 vtsax so here the sharpe ratio risk adjusted return of the u.s. portfolio is so much higher than the international portfolio over the period tracked that the loss of returns from adding more international stocks outweigh the lower risk that you would get from both just adding the lower vol international stocks and the diversification effects from having a correlation less than one the key point in the above is over the period tracked   when you do this type of analysis you implicitly assume that the returns risk observed in the past will be similar to the returns risk in the future    certainly if you had invested 100 in the u.s. recently you would have done better than investing in a mix of us intl   however while the risk and correlations of assets can be somewhat stable over time relative returns can vary wildly this uncertainty of future returns is why most people use a diversified portfolio of assets   what is the exact right amount is a very hard question though
