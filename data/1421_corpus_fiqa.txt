according to regulation t you can make as many day trade round trip stock purchases using a cash account as long as you have the funds to cover each and every round trip sale however the funds generated from the sales can not be used again to purchase new stocks until the settlement period or is over for example say you have $ 10000 dollars in your cash account and no securities you buy 1000 shares of xyz stock in the morning at one dollar per share and you sell the stock 30 minutes later because it went up say by 50 cents according to regulation t you can not use the money generated from the sale of your 1000 shares until after the settlement date however you can use the remaining $ 9000 dollars in your account to execute other trades just as the first trade you can do this as many times as you want as long as you have funds available to pay for the transaction the same day it 's executed the only thing to worry about and that is n't clear is what happens if you perform this action more than 3 times in a week does it mean that your cash account now becomes a margin account subject to margin account rules because you executed more than three round trip trades in a five day rolling period

no you can not   the cash settlement period will lock up your cash depending on the product you trade three business days for stocks 1 business day for options and you would need more than $ 5,000 to trade futures

i know of one practical difference between business checks 8 check and personal checks 6 check dealing with the paper check conversion rule to electronic debit    the national ach association created a rule that allows receivers of checks without an auxiliary on us field to convert your check into an electronic debit via the ach network   by default 6 checks personal checks do not have the on us field and are eligible to be converted to ach debit if you do not want your paper checks converted to ach debits then start using business checks with the on us field populated   you can use business checks for business or personal checking accounts more information can be found below

most important any gains you make from risking this sum of money over the next few years will not be life changing but if you ca n't afford to lose it then losses can be rhetorical question how can you trust what i say you should do with your money answer you ca n't i 'm happy to hear you 're reading about the stock market so please allow me to encourage you to keep learning   and broaden your target to investing or even further to financial planning   you may decide to pay down debt first   you may decide to hold cash since you need it within a couple years least important i suggest a roth ira at any online discount brokerage whose fees to open an account plus 1 transaction fee are the lowest to get you into a broad market index etf or mutual fund

create one account    you can change the beneficiary of the plan even to nieces yourself or your wife as many times as you need so long as you are spending the money on valid educational expenses are you 100 sure both of your kids are going to college   if you are n't really 100 sure a single account that you can move between them is the best bet also having recently looked in 529 plans here are some things you have probably already thought about look up good 529 plans here edit i do n't think you can worry about fairly dividing the money up   i can see your wanting to be fair but what is more important school or fairly dividing the money    a 529 is money only for school   assuming your kids are n't the same age and wo n't go to the same school their expenses will likely be different   the younger kid will benefit from more interest from a longer investment but suffer from having higher costs so if you want to insure both kids got $ 50 k for example from you by the time it is all said and done i think you would have to make that up from your own pocket   if only one child goes to school any money you give the other for starting their own business could n't come from the 529 without big tax penalties depending on your position and finances you could state something like i will cover your college expenses up to $ 50 k and then that is that   just monitor your 529 and shoot for having $ 100 k in the account by the time they are both college age   that runs a risk though because if one child does n't go to school your money is locked up for a while or will have tax issues

note the op does not state whether the employer sponsored retirement savings are pre tax or post tax such as a roth 401(k the following answer assumes the more common case of a pre tax plan this is a bad idea imho irs pub 970 lists exceptions to the 10 early withdrawal penalty for educational expenses this does n't include as far as i can tell student loan payments so withdrawing from your retirement account would incur both income tax and penalties even if there were an exception you 'd still have to pay income taxes which depending on the amount and your income could be at a higher marginal rate than you are currently paying   if you really want the debt gone as soon as possible why not reduce the amount you contribute to the retirement plan but not below the amount that gets you the maximum employer match and use that money to increase your monthly payments to the student loan note that if you do this you will pay taxes on income that would have been tax deferred in order to save money on interest so there 's still a trade off one more thing rather than rolling over to your new company 's plan you could roll over to a self directed traditional ira

he did n't lock in a growth rate of 4 he locked in a yield of 4 that 's the amount the bond pays in interest on his original investment each year if he just spends that money the bond will continue to pay 4 each year but there 's no growth in order to get growth he has to reinvest the interest as it comes in if he puts it into bonds the return on that new money and hence the growth depends on the prevailing interest rate at the time that the interest is paid that interest rate can be higher or lower than the original 4 there 's no connection between the two

the psychology of investing is fascinating i buy a stock that 's out of favor at $ 10 and sell half at a 400 profit $ 50/share then another half at $ 100 figuring you do n't ever lose taking a profit now my apple shares are over $ 500 but i only have 100 the $ 10 purchase was risky as apple pre ipod was n't a company that was guaranteed to survive   the only intelligent advice i can offer is to look at your holdings frequently and ask would i buy this stock today given its fundamentals and price if you would n't buy it you should n't hold it this is in contrast to the company ratings you see of buy hold sell if i should hold it but you should n't buy it to hold that makes no sense to me disclaimer i am old and have decided stock picking is tough most of our retirement accounts are indexed to the s&p. maybe 10 is in individual stocks the amount my stocks lag the index is less than my friends spend going to vegas so i 'm happy with the results most people would be far better off indexing than picking stocks

asset allocation serves many purposes not just mitigating risk via a diversification of asset classes but also allowing you to take a level of risk that is appropriate for a given investor at a given time by how much is allocated to which asset classes a younger investor with a longer timeframe may wish to take a lot more risk investing heavily in equities and perhaps managed funds that are of the aggressive growth variety seeking better than market returns someone a little older may wish to pull back a bit especially after a bull market has brought them substantial gains and begin to take money off the table perhaps by starting to establish some fixed income positions or pulling back to slightly less risky index   value or balanced funds an investor who is near or in retirement will generally want even less risk going to a much more balanced approach with half or more of their investments in fixed income and the remainder often in income producing blue chip type stocks or income funds   this allows them to protect a good amount of their wealth from potential loss at a time when they have to be able to depend on it for a majority of their income an institution such as yale has very different concerns and may always be in a more aggressive long term mode since retirement is not a factor for them   they are willing to invest mostly in very aggressive ways using diversification to protect them from one of those choices tanking but still overall taking a pretty high level of risk much more so than might be appropriate for an individual who will generally need to seek safety and to preserve gains as they get older   for example look at the pdf that linked and observe the overall risk level that yale is taking and in addition observe the large allocations they make to things like private equity with a risk level compared to their very small amount of fixed income with a 10 risk level   yale has a very long time horizon and invests in a way that is atypical of the needs and concerns of an individual investor   they also have as you pointed out the economy of scale with something like in assets to afford to hire proven experts and their own internal phd level experts to watch over the whole thing all of which very few individual investors have for either class of investor diversification is a means to mitigate risk by not having all your eggs in one basket   via having multiple different investments such as picking multiple individual stocks or aggressive funds with different approaches or just an index fund to get multiple stocks you are protected from being wiped out as might happen if a single choice might fail   for example imagine what would have happened if you had in 2005 put all your money into a single stock with a company that had been showing record profits   such as lehman brothers and left it there until 2008 when the stock tanked or even faster collapses such as enron etc that all looked great up until shortly after they failed utterly    being allocated across multiple asset classes provides some diversification all on it 's own but you can also be diversified within a class yale uses the diversification across several asset classes to have lower risk than being invested in a single asset class such as private equity but their allocation places much more of their funds in high risk classes and much less of their funds in the lowest risk classes such as fixed income

i suggest you begin by double checking what kinds of credit products you have and to which credit bureaus your bank reports not all financial institutions report to all bureaus for example if your bank only reports your one and only line of credit to experian transunion still wo n't have a file on you also some lines of credit such as being an authorized user on a credit card are n't tracked by all of the bureaus the other thing to consider is the amount of time that your lines of credit have been open you said it 's been less than one year but if it 's been less than six months you might try waiting six months to try requesting your reports if none of the above solves your problem i would respond to their letter exactly as they instruct you to send everything certified with return receipt and get into the habit of saving all of these records when you send your reply be sure to include all of the requested information a brief summary of your issue and a reference to their previous letter to you if they do n't respond to your letter or they are n't able to help you try calling the credit bureaus directly to inquire about the problem usually the consumer phone lines are automated so try the corporate or business contacts they list on their website on a final note never submit your information on any of the bureaus websites by doing so you agree to binding arbitration agreements which limit your right to sue only communicate with the bureaus by mail or on rare occasions phone

tl;dr my understanding of the rules is that if you are required to register for gst earning more than $ 75k per annum you would be required to pay gst on these items to clarify firstly taxable income and goods and services tax are two different things any income you receive needs to be considered for income tax purposes whether or not it ends up being taxable income would be too much to go into here but generally you would take your expenses and any deductions away from your income to arrive at what would generally be the taxable amount an accountant will help you do this income tax is paid by anyone who earns income over the tax free threshold by contrast goods and services tax is a tax paid by business of which you are running one of course this is passed on to the consumer but it 's the business that the payment to the tax office however gst is n't required to be charged and paid in all cases the key in your situation is first determining whether you need to register for gst or whether indeed you already have if you earn less than $ 75,000 per year no need to register if you do earn more than that through your business or you have registered anyway then the next question is whether your items are gst free the ato says that some education courses and course materials are gst free whether this applies to you or not i 'm obviously not going to be able to comment on so i would advise getting an accountant 's advice on this or at the very least call the ato or browse their legal database thirdly are your sales connected with australia the ato says that a sale of something other than goods or property is connected with australia if the thing is done in australia or the seller makes the sale through a business they carry on in australia both of these appear to be true in your case so in summary if you are required to register for gst you would be required to pay gst on these items i am not a financial advisor or a tax accountant and this is not financial advice

i work in finance and i think the biggest mistake you are making at 15 years old is saying that you specifically want to be a financial advisor   i 'm not trying to say the job is awful but most people who are interested in finance would not at all want this job you will spend 90 of your time trying to find clients most of the time it will be through cold calling people on the phone through some leads you either get through your agency or you paid for online or you have to start annoying friends and family never do this for most people the job is not about finance and it sucks once you finally get a client now you have a conflict of interest in that you want to sell them the high commission products so that you get paid but its often not the best product for them its actually very easy to become a financial planner extremely hard to become a successful one    instead what i would do is consider the wider field of finance there is so much more to finance than being a financial planner do you want to become an expert on stocks consider equity research do you want to help companies fix strategic problems and make a ton of money consider consulting do you want to help companies raise money by going public consider investment banking you can google the different types of careers online

if your counterparty sent money to a correspondent account at another bank then it is completely up to the other bank what to do with the money if the wire transfer completed then the account is not closed if i were your business partner i would immediately contact the bank to which the transfer was made and explain the situation and hopefully they will transfer the money back whenever a wire transfer is made the recipients name address and account number are included if that name address and account do not belong to you then you have a problem because you have no legal right to the money in a court of law for this reason you should be avoid any situation where you are wiring money to anyone except the intended recipient

if you look at a trade grid you can see how this happens if there are enough bids to cover all shares currently on the sell side at a certain price those shares will be bought and increased price quotes will be shown for the bids and ask if there are enough bids to cover this price those will get bought and higher prices will be shown and this process will repeat until the sell side has more power than the buy side it seems like this process is going on all day long with momentum either on the upside or downside but i think that much of this bidding and selling is automatic and is being done by large trading firms and high tech computers i also feel that many of these bids and asks are already programmed to appear once there is a price change so once one price gets bought computers will put in higher bids to take over asks it 's like a virtual war between trading firms and their computers when more money is on the buy side the stock will go up and vice versa i sort of feel like this high frequency trading is detrimental to the markets and does n't really give everyone a fair shot retail investors do not have the resources and knowledge in order to do this sort of high frequency trading it also seems to go against certain free market principles in my opinion

i am going to assume your location is the us from what i am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing   you are a poor risk at 7k month you have above average household income   the fact that all of your income is being washed off somewhere is a behavior problem not a mathematical one   for example why do you have a car payment   you should purchase a car for cash failing that given reasonable rent 1100 reasonable car payment 400 insurances 300 other expenses 1000 you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow   where is that money going   here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend   figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them by cutting back and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months   that is not a very long time    similarly we can discuss the grocery store   had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash   this would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this venture 's success   if you had started this one year ago you could have gone in with a significant down payment   the bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk   you spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question   if you can not handle the cash flows of regular employment well how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business   it is far more complex and there is far less room for error    so how do you get a loan   i would start with learning on how to manage your personal finance well prior to into the world of business

you say that one property is 65 of the value of the two properties and the other is 35   but how much of that do the two of you actually own   if you have co signed mortgages on both properties then your equity is going to be lower   if you sold both properties then your take away would be just half of that equity   and while the 35 property may be less valuable if you bought it first it may actually have more equity    it 's the equity that matters here not the value of the property   with a mortgage the bank is more of an owner than you are until you 've paid down most of the loan    you may find that the bank wo n't agree to a single owner refinance   a co signed mortgage is a lot easier for them to collect as they can hold either of you responsible for the entire loan    if you sell the 65 property then you can pay off any mortgage on that property and use the equity payout from that to buy out your relative on the 35 property   if you currently have no mortgage you 'd even have cash back   this is your strings option    let 's say that you have no mortgage now   so this mortgage would be the only mortgage on the property   it 's not so much as is or of the value of the property   that 's more of a home equity loan than a mortgage   you should be able to get a good rate   it might reduce your short term profit but it should be if you have other income    if you do n't have other income then seriously consider selling the 65 property and diversifying the payout into something else   e.g. stocks and bonds    perhaps your relative would be willing to float you the loan   that would save you bank fees and closing costs   write up a contract and agree to take assignment of the title at payoff   you 'll need to pay a lawyer to write up the contract paying a modest amount now to cover the various future possibilities but that should still be cheaper    there 's a certain amount of trust required on both sides but this gives you some separation   and of course it takes your relative out of the day to day management entirely   perhaps the steady flow of cash would provide what they need    if your relative is willing to remain that involved that can work   note that they may not want to do this so do n't get too attached to the idea   be prepared for a no   this would be a great option for you as you pretty much get everything you have now   they get back the time meeting with you to make decisions but they also give up control over those decisions   some people would not like that tradeoff    the one time i was involved with a professional managing a property for me the fee was around 7 of the rent   if that fits your area you might reasonably charge 5   that gives a discount for family and not being a professional    there 's a relatively easy way to find out what fits your area   look around and see what companies offer multiple listings   call until you find a couple that will do management for you   get quotes for managing your properties   now you 'll know the amounts    the big failing though is that this may not describe the issue that your relative has   if the real problem is that the two of you have different approaches to property management then making you the only decision maker may be the wrong direction   this is certainly financially feasible but it still may not be the right solution for your relationship    if you get a no on this i 'd recommend moving on to other solutions immediately   this may simply be too favorable to you

i believe the answer to your question boils down to a discussion of tax strategies and personal situation both now and in the future   as a result it 's pretty hard to give a concrete example to the question as asked right now for example if your tax rate now is likely to be higher than your tax rate at retirement it is for most people than putting the higher growth etf in a retirement fund makes some sense   but even then there are other considerations however if the opposite is true which could happen if your income is growing so fast that your retirement income looks like it will be higher than your current income than you might want the flexibility of holding all your etfs in your non tax advantaged brokerage account so that if you do incur capital gains they are paid at prevailing presumably lower tax rates    i assume you meant a brokerage account rather than a savings account since you usually ca n't hold etfs in a savings account i also want to mention that a holding in a corp account is n't necessarily taxed twice   it depends on the corporation type and the type of distribution   for example s corps pay no federal income tax themselves instead the owners pay taxes when money is distributed to them as personal income   which means you could trickle out the earnings from an holdings there such that it keeps you under any given federal tax bracket assuming it 's your only personal income    this might come in handy when retired for example    also distribution of the holdings as dividends would incur cap gains tax rates rather than personal income tax rates one thing i would definitely say any holdings in a roth account ira 401k will have no future taxes on earnings or distributions unless the gov't changes its mind   thus putting your highest total return etf there would always be the right move
# 458529
though mentioned it in a comment i would like to emphasize the point that the financial planner cfp you talked to said that he was a fiduciary   a fiduciary has an obligation to act in your best interests   according to when one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter   so any of these stack exchange community members may or may not have your best interest at heart but the financial advisor you talked to is obligated to you have to decide for yourself is it worth 1 of your investment to have someone legally obligated to have your best financial interest in mind versus for example someone who might steer you to an overpriced insurance product in the guise of an investment just so they can make a buck off of you   or versus wandering the internet trying to make sense of conflicting advice   in my opinion a fiduciary registered cfp is probably the best person to answer your questions

it 's probably a scam or maybe some amateur agency trying to put pressure on their target normal garnishment goes through the court system just ignore it tell your employer they obviously have the wrong person since the ss is wrong   suing clowns like this is not worth it just to clarify this some more for you trying to collect on a random person with the same name is called tagging in the collection industry before 2010 it was common because it was actually easier to legally bully the wrong person who had money than the right person who does not have money that was then this is now various federal and state laws have been passed since that time to prevent identity theft and these laws create big liabilities for debt collectors that try to bully the wrong person therefore it rarely happens anymore though of course sometimes agencies will still call you if they think they have a soft target that 's what the call to your employer is just a test a pro collector like a law firm would never call an employer because they could get sued for doing that but some amateur working out of his basement might that 's what you are dealing with some in a basement such people never sue they just buy old debt for pennies on the dollar and try random harassing phone calls ignore it and he will move on to the next john smith on his list a lot of lawyers will advise you to talk to the collector correcting their misinformation blah blah lawyers like talking because the more talk there is the more money they make in the real legal world never talk to your enemy or give them information the way real courts and judges work is that they do n't like plaintiffs who sue the wrong person in fact they do not like it very much very bad things happen in to people who sue the wrong person judges have very short patience in general and they do not like it when somebody wastes their time by suing the wrong person basically what this means is ignore the guy and he will go away

i will start with the assumption that you will never have any late payments and will fully pay off the loan this may be a big assumption but if you ca n't assume that then you would n't have asked the question in the first place the answer depends on your income you should calculate how much student loan interest you can deduct before and after the switch and adjust the interest rate accordingly to compensate for any difference

to directly answer your question the best choice is to pay cash and place the rest on your student loan this is saving you from paying more interest   to offer some advise consider purchasing a cheaper car to place more money towards your student loan debt this will be the best financial decision in the long term   i suspect the reason you are considering financing this vehicle is that the cash payment feels like a lot trust your instinct here this vehicle sounds like large splurge considering your current debt and your gut is telling you as much be patient use your liquid funds to get a more affordable vehicle and attack the debt that is setting yourself up for financial success

stock index funds are likely but not certainly to be a good long term investment   in countries other than the usa there have been 30 + year periods where stocks either underperformed compared to bonds or even lost value in absolute terms   this suggests that it may be an to assume that they always do well in the long term   furthermore it may suggest that they are persistently overvalued for the risk and perhaps due for a long term correction   if everybody assumes they 're safe the equity risk premium is likely to be eaten up putting all of your money into them would for most people be taking an unnecessary risk   you should cover some other asset classes too   if stocks do very well a portfolio with some allocation to more stable assets will still do fairly well   if they crash a portfolio with less risky assets will have a better chance of being at least adequate

the biggest reason why one might want to leave 401k money invested in an ex employer 's plan is that the plan offers some superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere e.g. some mutual funds that are not open to individual investors such as s&p index funds for institutional investors these have expense ratios even smaller than the already low expense ratios of good s&p index funds or hot funds that are usually temporarily closed to new investors etc the biggest reason to roll over 401k money from an ex employer 's plan to the 401k plan of a new employer is essentially the same the new employer 's plan offers superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere of course the new employer 's   401k plan must accept such roll overs i do not believe that it is a requirement that a 401k plan must accept rollovers but rather an option that a plan can be set up to allow   for or not   another reason to roll over 401k money from one plan to another   rather than into an ira is to keep it safe from creditors if you are   sued and found liable for damages in a court proceeding the plaintiff can come after ira assets but not after 401k money   also you can take a loan from the 401k money subject to various rules about how much can be borrowed payment requirements etc which you can not from an ira that being said the benefits of keeping 401k money as 401k money must be weighed against the usually higher administrative costs and usually poorer and more limited choices of investment opportunities   available in most 401k plans as muro has said already

of course it can this is a time value of money calculation if i knew the maturity date or current yield to maturity i 'd be able to calculate the other number and advise how much rates need to rise to cause the value to drop from 18 to 17 for a 10 year bond a rise today of .1 will cause the bond to drop about 1 in value this is a back of napkin calculation finance calculators offer precision edit when i calculate present value with 34 years to go and yield to maturity i get $ at the value drops to $ a drop of 3.1   edit geo asked me to show calculations here it goes a the simplest way to calculate present value for a zero coupon bond is to take the rate convert it to and divide into the face value $ 100 i offer this as the four function calculator approach so one enters $ 100 divided by and repeat for the number of years left a bit of precision is lost if there 's a fractional year involved but it 's close the bid ask will be wider than this error introduced   b next if you 've never read my open declaration of love for my texas instruments ba-35 calculator here it is again one enters for the years fv = 100 rate = and then pv it will give the result $   c here is how to do it in excel   the numbers in lines 1 3 are self evident the equation in cell is = please note there are tiny differences in the way to calculate in excel vs a calculator excel wants the rate to be so i divided by 100 in the equation cell   that 's the best 3 ways i know to calculate present value geo if you 've not noticed the time value of money is near and dear to me it comes into play for bonds mortgages and many aspect of investing the equations get more complex if there are payments each year but both the ba-35 and excel are up to it

you do realize that the fund will have management expenses that are likely already factored into the nav and that when you sell the nav will not yet be known right there are often fees to run a mutual fund that may be taken as part of managing the fund that are already factored into the net asset of the shares that would be my caution as well as possible fee changes as dilip sarwate notes in a comment expense ratios are standard for mutual funds yes individual stocks that represent corporations not structured as a mutual fund do n't declare a ratio of how much are their costs e.g. apple or google may well invest in numerous other companies but the costs of making those investments wo n't be well detailed though these companies do have non investment operations of course do n't forget to read the fund 's prospectus as sometimes a fund will have other fees like account maintenance fees that may be taken out of distributions as well as being aware of how taxes will be handled as you do n't specify what kind of account these purchases are being done using

budgeting is really about planning your spending many programs and most advice will tell you that budgeting is tracking your expenses that 's only the first part track your expenses for about a month to figure out what you plan to spend in the future   your budget is then just a list of things you 're going to buy or pay for with the money you have at the moment i recommend creating a budget every time you get some money keeping an eye out for future expenses you may need to save for the envelopes are for those expense that you are going to use cash for the envelopes make you plan to spend a specific amount of money the money you put in them and no more envelopes protect you from overspending i use envelopes that is or sticky notes or different sections of my wallet to organize my cash i use cash for things i 'm going to buy in person gasoline groceries eating out the movies home improvement stuff buying birthday presents these are my envelope expenses i use one check a month to pay rent i use my online banking to pay most of my bills automatically like school loan and netflix and i use the actual websites of those companies who i want to pay manually like utilities b c those change every month does that help family budgets for both of us

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

because your friend is n't going to like the ~2 charge they have to pay to the credit card company on the $ 10,000 purchase credit card companies make money off of transactions the cardholder normally does n't pay any transaction fees and in fact can make a profit via rewards but the merchant has to pay a certain amount of money to the credit card company for the transaction in this case the apartment owners ate the charge likely because it was easier for them to send a check than to refund the cost of the fee through the credit card company if you started doing this a lot to take advantage of this i would imagine they would get smart and refuse your business it 'll be pretty obvious what you 're doing if you 're not signing any leases

well yes you 've implicitly made many assumptions such as that the embedded option has longer maturity the important thing to consider is when this option pays out the premium will obviously be adjusted   for a concrete example consider an equity option on an option the outer option has strike 110 the inner option has strike 100 spot = forward = 100 then the inner strike pays out when gt 100 but the outer option has zero value there the overall option only pays out if gt 110 reducing the structure to a call option with strike 110

with student loans at 2 i would n't pay a dime over minimum on that and i certainly would n't sell an investment property to pay them off you can get cd 's that beat 2 interest with the rentals you could sell the one that is n't performing as well and pay no capital gains tax if you lived in it 2 of the last 5 years counting 5 years back from sale date that 'd be a nice chunk of money for your down payment the risk of using proceeds to buy a different rental property is that you may find you do n't like being a distance landlord and then you 'd lose money selling or be stuck doing something you do n't enjoy for a while until you can sell without a loss like you mentioned the risk of selling either both rental properties is that if the arizona housing rental markets do well you 'd have given up your position and missed out ultimately i think it 's about your desired timeline if you are content to wait a while to buy in san diego you could have a handsome down payment will know whether or not you like being a distance landlord and can sell keep the rentals accordingly alternatively if you want to get a house in san diego sooner then selling one or both rentals gets you there faster if i was in your position i 'd probably sell the rental that i lived in and put that toward a down payment on a primary residence keeping the other rental for now and trying my hand at being a distance landlord

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy

my theory if you must be in debit own it at the least expense possible the interest you will pay by the end combined with the future value of money example the future value of $ 3000 at an effective interest rate of 5 after 3 years = $ present value of $ 3000 at 5 over 3 years = $ you will need more money in the future to pay for the same item

because 401k 's are also used by self employed a person who has a schedule c profitable income can open a 401k and match in whatever ratio he wants up to 25 of the net profits or the limits you stated this allows self employed to defer more income taxes to the future why only self employed good question ask your congressman my explanation would be that since they 're self employed they 're in much more danger of not having income especially later in life if their business go south thus they need a bigger cushion than an average w2 employee who can just find another job

your calculations are correct if you use the same mortgage rate for both the 15 and 30 year mortgages   however generally when you apply for a 15 year mortgage the interest rate is significantly less than the 30 year rate   the rate is lower for a number of reasons but mainly there is less risk for the bank on a 15 year payoff plan

you do n't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending budget account   there are a couple of reasons   first investment account balances change daily based on the market   if you set it up as a budget account then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes   second because you are investing for retirement this money will be untouchable for many years there is no need to include that in your spending budget instead enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction not a transfer to another budget account   if for example you are sending $ 400 per month to your retirement account just enter that as a monthly $ 400 expense out of your checking account assigning it to a retirement category   that money then leaves your budget if you want to see the value of your investment account in ynab so that your net worth is accurate add the account as an investment account   the value will not affect your budget categories but it will affect the net worth on the all accounts page   either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement

term life insurance is just that life insurance that pays out if you die just like car insurance pays out if you have an accident like car insurance it 's easy to compare amongst term life insurance policies you can even compare quotes online   whole life insurance is life insurance plus an investment component the money that you pay goes to pay for your life insurance and it also is invested by the insurance company insurance companies love whole life because it is not a commodity they can come up with a large variety of variants and that fact plus the fact that it combines insurance and investment means that is very difficult to compare policies not to mention that fact that none of the companies as far as i can tell publish their whole life insurance rates so it is very difficult to shop around

this may be relevant it suggests that irs is lenient with the attachment of the form with 1040 to paraphrase the ruling involved a taxpayer who timely filed the election with the irs within 30 days of the property transfer but who did not attach a copy of the election to his or her form 1040 for the year of the transfer   fortunately for the taxpayer in question the ruling indicated that the submission of the election to the irs within 30 days of the property transfer fulfilled the requirements for a valid election and the failure to attach the copy to the tax return did not affect the validity of the election   the irs requested that the taxpayer forward a copy of the election to the irs to be associated with the processing of the tax return see more at if someone wants to the irs ruling and this is the article where i saw the above referenced

when you start at a new job here in the u.s. the default means of payment is usually a paper check most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check   even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies a counter example is a self employed contractor perhaps a carpenter or house painter   these folks are paid by their customers homeowners and such   many larger well established now accept credit card payments from customers but smaller may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments   3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins   in such cases these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments there are a few folks here who do n't trust direct deposit or more specifically do n't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time   some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account in my experience the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash   they may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash i operate in a manner similar to you i use a debit card or credit card i only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life i use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage and i receive my paycheck by direct deposit   there have been periods where i have n't written or received paper checks for so long that i have to hunt for where i put my checkbook even though i use a debit card for most store purchases the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank   again the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc   direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week i do n't think this is all that unique to the us   there are people in every city and country who do n't have long term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments    i 'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet actually

you want to buy when the stock market is at an all time low for that day unfortunately you do n't know the lowest time until the end of the day and then you uh ca n't buy the stock now the stock market is not random but for your case we can say that effectively it is so when should you buy the stock to hopefully get the lowest price for the day you should wait for 37 of the day and then buy when it is lower than it has been for all of that day here is a quick example with fake data we have 18 points and 37 of 18 is close to 7 so we discard the first 7 points and just remember the lowest of those 7 we bear in mind that the lowest for the first 37 was 5 now we wait until we find a stock which is lower than 5 and we buy at that point this system is optimal for buying the stock at the lowest price for the day why we want to find the   best position to stop automatically ignoring why 37 we know the answer to in position n it 's as there are n toilets and we can select just 1 now what is the chance we select them given we 're in position n the chance of selecting any of the toilets from 0 to k is 0 remember we 're never going to buy then so let 's move on to the toilets from and onwards if is better than all before it we have this but might not be the best price from all past and future prices maybe is better let 's look at for we have k for we have k so we have this is a close approximation of the area under especially as x    so 0 + 0 + + k n x + + + ≈ k n x k and so ≈ k n x k now to simplify say that x = k n we can graph this and find the maximum point so we know the maximum or we can use calculus here 's the graph   here 's the calculus to apply this back to your situation with the stocks if your stock updates every 30 seconds and is open between and we have 6.5 hours = 390 minutes = 780 you should keep track of the lowest price for the first and then buy your stock on the next best price because x = k n the chance of you choosing the best price is 37 however the chance of you choosing better than the average stock is above 50 for the day remember this method just tries to mean you do n't loose money within the day if you want to try to minimise losses within the whole trading period you should scale this up so you wait 37 of the trading period e.g. 37 of 3 months and then select the maths is taken from mathematical way to choose a toilet finally one way to lose money a little slower and do some good is with giving loans to people is developing countries it 's like a bank account with a -1 interest which is only 1 lower than a lot of banks and you do some good i have no affiliation with them

most financial advisors are actually financial product salesmen   their job is to sweet talk you into parting with as much money as possible either in management fees or in commissions kickbacks on high fee investment products which come from fees charged to you inside the investment   this is a cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves   realistically that is how they feed their family and i empathize but i ca n't afford to buy their product   i wish they would sell something else these people prey on people 's financial lack of knowledge   for instance you put too much importance on returns   why   because the salesman told you that 's important   it 's not   the market goes up and down that 's normal   the question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees   how do you tell that and generally if you 're invested well   you compare your money 's performance to an index that 's relevant to you   you 've heard of   the s&p 500 that 's an index relevant to us investors   take 2015 the s&p 500 was $ on january 2 2015   it was $ on december 31 2015   so it was flat   it dropped 0.7 if your us investments dropped 0.7 you broke even   if you made less that was lost to the expenses within the investment or the investment performing worse than the s&p 500 index   i lost 0.8 in 2015 the extra 0.1 being expenses of the investment try 2013 s&p 500 was $ on december 28 2012 and $ on dec. 27 2013 that 's growth   that 's amazing but it also means is holding even with the market   if your salesman proudly announced that you made 18 problem all this to say when you say the investments performed poorly do n't go by absolute numbers find a suitable index and compare to the index   a lot of markets were down in 2015 16 and that is not your investment 's fault   you want to know if were down compared to your index    because that reflects either a lousy funds manager or high fees    this may leave you wondering where can i invest that is safe and has sensible fees   i do n't know your market but here we have discount brokers which allow self selection of investments charge no custodial fees and simply charge by the trade commonly $ 10   many mutual funds and etfs are index funds with very low annual fees 0.20 1 in 500 or even less     how do you pick investments look at any of numerous books starting with john bogle 's classic common sense on mutual funds book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low   if you need the cool confident professional to hand hold you through the process a fee only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest   they honestly recommend what 's best for you but beware many commission driven salespeople pretend to be fee only advisors   the good advisor will be happy to advise investment types and let you pick the brand fidelity vs vanguard and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you do n't share frankly finance is not that hard   but it 's made hard by impossibly complex products that do n't need to exist and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees   avoid those products   you just do n't need them   now you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is like i say they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing and i am confused   although it does n't seem like much of a question to me   1.5 a quarter is 6 a year or 60 in 10 years to ignore compounding if the market grows 6 a year on average so growth just pays the fees they will consume 60 of the $ 220,000 or $   as far as the $ 60,000 for that kind of money it 's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place   put some legal pressure on them that $ 60k penalty might get a lot smaller    for instance they 'll recommend which has a 5.25 buy in fee front end load and a 1.23 per year fee expense ratio compare to with zero load and a 0.20 fee   that front end load is kicked back to your broker as commission so he literally ca n't recommend there 's no commission his company would and should fire him for doing so

this is n't super specific to your question but i 'd recommend that you invest a ton of time in practice questions then review the answers to the ones you got wrong this is a good strategy for most exams but it 's particularly true for the series 7 as the is notorious for using questions on the actual exam that are almost identical to practice questions i was amazed at how many questions i recognized almost word for word when i took it    i recently took my cfp test so i 'm pretty up on testing concepts and that sort of thing right now if you are running into anything in particular feel free to pm me

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

you buy stocks for dividends over the long term   if a share of stock pays $ 1.00 in dividends every quarter that 's four dollars a year   if you bought it for $ 40 it pays out $ 4 in a year and it 's still worth roughly $ 40 at the end of the year you 're $ 4 richer   people will often invest large amounts of money in stable stocks not planning to sell it but only collect the dividends which are either re invested or pulled out as income

to me this is a tax structure that is working as it should the tax code is providing strong incentives for starbucks to expand during the initial breakthrough period they are incurring significant expenses these huge costs are being offset somewhat by the provisions in the tax code the government in this case has provided a system by which starbucks is encouraged to grow their volume of future taxable revenue    simple    edit   after further review of the article it 's not quite as simple as i made it out to be in my above comment i think the point is still valid however

that is the best part everyone is brick and mortar stores are dead bandwagon reminds of the .com bubble the customer base that walmart is and will continue to be is the vast majority of not only the us but the world the thing is these people like going to the store and browsing around and entertaining the physical aspect of buying shit rather than just point and clicking the thing walmart is doing is playing on what think makes america they have heavy plans on american manufacturing and production which will be sold in their own stores which they will charge a slightly lower price for and make a stupid amount of money while at the same time buying up advanced auto parts and taking over their 5000 plus stores and capabilities and then diving in which is a prediction buying blue apron type operation and then simply taking over walmart does not need to get into the area of netflix or any of the like because they can simply buy out down the road a company they can make compete in that field to hold onto the market share   amazon is the single most inflated outrageously high stock that has ever existed because of peoples ignorance of what the internet brings they are rightfully and smartly playing on that but it wo n't pan out   walmart is smart by pushing partnerships with fed ex and ups which are 2 of the largest carries in the world and employee well payed middle class people that look for dedication and respect no matter what generation you belong to not to mention they contract out with multiple trucking companies

my personal rule is to not loan money or co sign for any amount that i am not willing to give away   it can go wrong in so many ways and having a family or friend involved means making a business decision is difficult if a bank wo n't loan the person the money why should i   being a co signer is the same as borrowing the money in my name and giving it right over to the borrower there might be great reasons to do it   i would probably sign a loan to keep my family alive or healthy but no other reason   there are many ways to help without signing a loan   give a room and a place to live loan a car the other thing is if you really truly believe in the borrower it wo n't do long term damage to your credit or your financial goals and you are the only resort go ahead   i am thinking about helping a teenager afford their first car or student loans

gt;it certainly was n't a priority for the government to oversee account opening operations at the branch level   finance protection bureau   what the hell are they supposed to be doing then there are already multiple organizations for the institutional level this group was created specifically for consumer level products and they missed one of the most blatant and widespread abuses in recent history   dodd frank is like if my kid crashed my car so i broke his arm to make sure it never happened again making sure he can never crash cause he ca n't even get behind the wheel but failing to consider the greater consequences among those of us who chose to leave big banks for smaller banks who now have carte to gamble in order to compete with the big guys looks to me like a strategy to discredit smaller banks in the end   please explain this one to me because i do n't understand what you mean at all you know most of the bulge bracket banks are against this rule while many community banks have expressed support and what are you talking about freedom to compete against the big guys what are you even talking about and how is that freedom threatened   since you brought up republicans it seems to me like you are a liberal who hears republican regulation and immediately think you have to be against it there are a number of reasons this bill should receive bipartisan support   the guy who sponsored this bill was against the bail outs of 08 and wanted the banks to just fail   the compliance costs under dodd are massive and smaller banks ca n't afford to pay them and they should n't have to because if they fail to meet compliance they will just go bankrupt and wo n't bring the economy down with them    more overhead for compliance = lower deposit rates for clients = ca n't compete with bulge brackets on a side note this is a general rule anyways and why i think its stupid to be using a community bank ever    it removes the orderly liquidation authority and leaves big banks to die instead of getting bailed out   other than the stigma of voting for gop backed repealing of regulation the only real counter argument seems to be elizabeth warren trickle down wall street 1

this is similar to your tfsa question while the s in rrsp or tfsa stands for savings it does not stipulate exactly what instruments you use to build up those savings with few exceptions you can hold any type of investment in either an rrsp or tfsa thus do not think of them as savings accounts per se but more like umbrella accounts or plans it 's actually the financial industry that creates these of so called rrsps which are usually gics or balanced mutual funds held inside an rrsp plan or tfsas which are literally savings accounts held inside a tfsa plan the most versatile accounts are the self directed rrsp or tfsa accounts usually through a discount broker where you can purchase many different types of investments inside your registered accounts including stocks bonds mutual funds gics gold etc thus a share purchase plan held inside an rrsp is completely eligible and may be a sensible investment for retirement savings

you have interpreted the instructions correctly the issue with two jobs at the same time is that that second job will be taxed at the highest rate but the second employer has no idea what the other position is paying you   if you make enough to be in the 15 tax bracket for your main job that means some of the money from each paycheck is   taxed zero some is taxed at 10 and the last dollars are taxed at 15 but the second job should withhold for taxes to cover all the income at 15 to avoid problems you should look at the tax form you are filling out this year look at the total tax you paid not the refund or the amount you owed when you filed but your total tax paid the government allows a safe harbor if you make sure that in 2016 you have the same amount withheld this calendar year if that is n't enough you will owe money in april 2017 but you will not have to pay a penalty after you have a couple of paycheck from your main employer check to see that if you work the rest of the year at that same rate that the federal withholding will make the safe harbor if you will make it   you do n't have to worry about the penalty if you will fall short adjust the w-4 accordingly

yes this is possible in the most liquid securities but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount there are also position size limits set by the occ and other self regulatory organizations that attempt to prevent people from a market through the options market getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming although this is still very very possible so for your example of an option of $ 1.00 per contract then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened by one person account that is realistically you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates stock indexes are some very liquid examples so for the standard poors you can open options contracts on the spy etf as well as the s&p 500 futures as well as many other s&p 500 products that only trade options and do not have the ability to be traded as the underlying shares and there is also the saying liquidity liquidity meaning that because you are making the market more liquid other large market participants will also see the liquidity and want to participate where they previously thought it was too illiquid and impossible to close a large position quickly

reading irs regulations section more closely i see that this was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price therefore at the time of filing prior years there was no way of knowing the final contingent payment would not be reached and thus the prior years were filed correctly and should not be amended those regulations go on to give an example of a sale with a stated maximum selling price where the maximum was not reached due to contingency and states that in such cases when the maximum payment amount is subsequently reduced the gross profit ratio will be with respect to payments received in or after the taxable year in which an event requiring reduction occurs however in this case that would result in a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form which turbo tax reports should be a non negative number   looking further in the regulations i found an example which relates to bankruptcy and a resulting loss in a subsequent year for 1992 a will report a loss of $ 5 million attributable to the sale taken at the time determined to be appropriate under the rules generally applicable to worthless debts therefore i used a gross profit ratio of zero on line 19 and entered a separate stock sale not reported on a 1099-b as a worthless stock on form 8949 as a capital loss based upon the remaining basis in the stock sold in an installment sale   i also included an explanatory statement with my return to the irs stating in 2008 i entered into an installment sale of stock the sale was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price the sales price did not reach the agreed upon maximum sales price due to some contingencies not being met according to the irs    regulations section my basis in the stock remains at $ 500 in 2012 after the final payment rather than using a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form i 'm using a zero ratio and treating the remaining basis as a schedule d loss similar to worthless stock since the sale is now complete and my remaining basis is no longer recoverable

you 're looking for the amortization calculation this calculation is essentially solving for the series of cash flows that will yield a zero balance after the specified term at the given rate for a loan amount once you have solved for the payment amount you can add additional principal amount to each payment period and see the interest payments and time to zero balance drop

there are people whose strategy revolves around putting orders at the bid and ask and making money off people who cross the spread   if you put an order in between the current bid ask people running that type of strategy will usually pick it off viewing it as a discount to the orders that they already have on the bid ask   often these people are trading by computer so your limit order may get hit so quickly that it appears instantaneous to you   in reality you were probably hit by a limit order placed specifically to fill against yours

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

that gives their competition time to take market share   except total actual market is decreasing the pool of market share is going down so what 's happening is companies are slashing margins to even maintain market share much less increase it look at what 's happening in computers dell hp acer lenovo apple 's sales numbers dropped for as well but because they did nt drop as much as hp or lenovo their market share went up this is the new normal less than stellar sales   gt;as long as there is money on the table someone is going to reach for it markets are n't known for their patience   problem is there is less and less money on the table big companies are squeezing little companies know what you just described wal mart puts the little guy out of they 're    tax burdens cause tax avoidance they do n't touch production as long as profits are still available   yes some but you can only avoid it if you are multi national businesses with completely domestic operations can not avoid liabilities in the same way but as i said above the markets are shrinking there is less money on the table and the players that are left are fighting over the last scraps that is obviously a bit extreme but i personally deal with a lot of retailers and and there is not the wiggle room you describe i get beat up for a few dollars    i am not talking about banks or energy companies or healthcare companies i am talking about the thousands of small and medium businesses that are already squeezed these entities are the of the larger economy one or two go out of business and nobody notices but hundreds and thousands of these companies have closed now a healthy company is not made up of only wal mart exxon and apple

wikipedia talks about the chinese currency scholarly studies suggest that the yuan is undervalued on the basis of purchasing power parity analysis so despite it appearing cheaper due to the official exchange rate the price in china might actually be fair there are also restrictions on foreign exchange purportedly to prevent inflows of hot money which in concert with any other legal obstacles to owning or trading on the chinese exchange may also explain why the high frequency traders are n't tripping over each other to arbitrage away the difference

fico is a financial services company whose customers are financial services companies   their products are for the benefit of their customers not consumers the purpose of the credit score system is two fold   first the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions fico 's customers to assess the risk of loans that they make   this is probably based on science although the fico studies and even the fico score formula are proprietary secrets the second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money   and they have done a great job of that   if you think you might need a loan in the future perhaps a mortgage or a car loan you need a credit score   and the only way to get a credit score is to start borrowing money now that you do n't need    yes someone with a good income and a long history of paying utility bills on time would be a great credit risk for a mortgage   however that person will have no credit score and therefore be declared by fico as a bad credit risk   on the other hand someone with a low income who struggles but succeeds to make the minimum payment on their credit card would have a better credit score   the advice offered to the first person is start borrowing money now even though you do n't need it i 'm not anti credit card   i use a credit card responsibly paying it off in full every month   i use it for the convenience   i do n't worry at all about my credit score but i 've been told it is great   however there are some people that can not use a credit card responsibly   the temptation is too great   perhaps they are like problem gamblers i do n't know   but fico and the financial services industry have created a system that makes a credit card a necessity in many ways   these are the people that get hurt in the current system

apparently it is up to the credit card company on how they want to report your available balance another disadvantage to the no limit    credit card may not be apparent to    most people but it is something noted    by organizations like the motley fool    which is expert in many issues of    finance and investment part of your    credit   score about 30 considers    the amount of money you have borrowed    and the limit on your present credit    cards a no limit credit card company    may report your limit as $ 0 if you    have not used the card or they may    report   a maximum limit available to    you they may not nor are they    obligated to report times when you    put tons of expenses on a credit   card    and then paid them off while some companies will report your    timely payments and paid off amounts    others simply report an extremely low    limit for instance if you spent $ 100    us dollars usd your limit might be    considered $ 100 usd or it may merely    be reported as zero you ’ll need to    check with a credit card company on    how they report payments and limits on    a no limit credit card before you    obtain one some people who are    are paying off their cards    at the end of each month suffer major    losses to their credit score without    even realizing it if their spending    ability is rated at zero or their    payments do n’t count toward showing    credit worthiness source

typically you can use credit card balance transfers to consolidate some or all of your other loan balances in one place   the interest rate might be lower   some prefer to make one payment rather than multiple payments   there is typically a fee that is imposed by the card that is originating or creating the loan   this would be the credit card you are transferring the balances   that fee is typically in the 3 to 5 range    while tempting and attractive on the surface this plan typically leads to a worse situation then you are now    it 's a tough pill to swallow but your problem is that you spend too much money   transferring money will not change this problem it is your behavior that has to change in order to not accumulate more debt   it has to change further if you want to get rid of the debt in a timely fashion    you would be far better served to forget about this transfer and get your life into control   spend a lot less earn more   pay off the cards you have now and cut them up   make a goal to be done in a year and figure out how to earn enough money to make that happen btw i am a reformed over spender that now owes nothing   yep my house cars and rental property are all paid for   you can get there too

if you are already invested in a particular stock i like joetaxpayer 's answer think about it as if you are re buying the stocks you own every day you decide to keep them and do n't set emotional anchor points about what you paid for them or what they might be worth tomorrow these lead to two major logical fallacies that investor 's commonly fall prey to loss aversion and sunk cost both of which can be bad for your portfolio in the long run to avert these natural tendencies i suggest having a game plan before you purchase a stock based on on your investment goals for that stock for example a combination of one or more of the following i 'm investing for the long term and i expect this stock to appreciate and will hold it until specific event time at which point i will sell it all sell it gradually over a fixed time period right around the time i need the money i 'm going to bail on this stock if it falls more than x from my purchase price i 'm going to cash out all half some of this investment if it gains more than x from my purchase price to lock in my returns the important thing is to arrive at a strategy before you are invested and are likely to be more emotional than rational   otherwise it can be very hard to sell a hot stock that has suddenly jumped in price 25 because it has momentum gambler 's fallacy conversely it can be hard to sell a stock when it drops by 25 because i know it will bounce back eventually sunk cost loss aversion fallacy   also remember that there is opportunity cost from sticking with a losing investment because your brain is saying i really have n't lost money until i give up and sell it when logically you should be thinking if i move my money to a more promising investment i could get a better return than i am likely to on what i 'm holding

unless you suffer from the illusion that you can time the market it honestly does n't matter much the difference is lost in the noise that may be true even if you do suffer from that illusion   also as discussed here previously the drop in a stock 's price right after the dividend has been paid just reflects the fact that you are n't about to get an immediate refund in the form of a dividend if you look at the real cost per share it 's meaningless and can should be ignored buying after the dividend is paid may save you a tiny fraction of a cent of short term income tax but that 's meaningless in real terms

question   so basically the money created in this globalized digital world where capital is free to   it is referring to digital money and not actual physical cash   so the that talk about america becoming weimar republic is delusional since there is n't enough physical cash in relations to how big the economy is     and it is actually the debt lending that acts as a derivative of cash money that goes around posing as the money supply or the blood supply of an economy and that feels like inflation but when the debt is defaulted on or destroyed underwritten or even paid back closing the circuit then it 's deflationary    but does defaulting on ones debt create inflation since that money is still in the system and not being paid off   you know when debts are paid off they are taken out of the system

if it was me i would sell the house and use the proceeds to work on pay off the second    you do n't speak to your income but it must be pretty darn healthy to convince someone to lend you k on two homes   given this situation i am not sure what income i would have to have to feel comfortable   i am thinking around 500k year would start to make me feel okay but i would probably want it higher than that think i can rent out the 1st house for $ 1500 and after property management fees take home about $ 435 per month that is not including any additional taxes on that income or deductions based on repair work etc so this is why   given that your income is probably pretty high would something less than $ 435 really move your net worth needle   no   it is worth the reduction in risk to give up that amount of passive income   keeping the home opens you up to all kinds of risk   your $ 435 per month could easily evaporate into something negative given taxes likely rise in insurance rates and repairs   you have a great shovel to build wealth there is no reason to assume this kind of exposure   you will become wealthy if you invest and work to reduce your debt

as pointed out in a comment it would be more natural to get a regular mortgage on the second house which is essentially using the second house as collateral for its own loan   if you are to use the first house either mortgage it or get a home equity line of credit on it and use that money to buy the second house the relative merits of the options may depend in part on where you live whether or not you live in the homes and the relative cost of the two properties   for example in the us first and second homes get preferred tax treatment in addition to rates that are typically better than commercial loans including mortgages for investment properties   if you 're going to get a better rate and pay less taxes on one option and not on the others that 's definitely something to weigh

owing taxes to two or more levels of government is n't double taxation it 's a feature of the american union i 'm not for this bill in general mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it by owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid there 's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with usually artificially low local taxes and fewer state programs usually republican

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

the basic idea is that the average person ca n't deduct health care costs unless they 're really onerous but a business can and as a self employed person you can deduct those costs from the businesses earnings as long as the business is really generating enough profit to cover the health insurance costs that 's why most people get their health insurance from their employer actually the relevant irs rules say you may be able to deduct premiums paid for medical and dental insurance and qualified long term care insurance for you your spouse and your dependents if you are a self employed individual with a net profit reported on schedule c form 1040 for 2010 thanks to the small business jobs act of 2010 you can even deduct the premium from your income before deducting the self employment tax source i 'm sure that when you get your tax returns and instructions for 2010 this will all be spelled out

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

as others have pointed out the theoretical prices in each exchange rate are identical however the cost to you may vary you need to work out the opportunity cost of using each of the three currencies because you lose money every time you convert between two currencies let 's supposed for example that you live in canada and earn and spend cad there but also happen to have some hkd to keep this simple i 'll ignore the usd but you can apply the same reasoning to that if you 're not planning on visiting hong kong for a while then your holdings of hkd are just gathering dust so your choices are to convert them to cad and make the gbp purchase in cad or to spend the hkd directly on the gbp purchase probably the first option will end up costing you more in conversion fees than the second but you need to look at the precise costs to verify this if you are planning on visiting hong kong soon and will need the hkd then the choices are somewhat different you can either spend cad on the gbp purchase or you can spend the hkd on the gbp purchase and then soon convert some cad into more hkd for your trip in this case the first option will probably end up costing you less in conversion fees

that stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business when you put cabs on the road there are only a few models to work with the lease model where the company puts as many cabs on the road as possible the commission model where they balance fleet size and demand and the medallion model where you have a lot of individual operators    the lease model sounds nice for the customers because there 's excess cabs compared to demand but drivers are n't going to pay $ 160 300 a shift to not make any money so even still the cab company has limit the number of cabs they put on the road   in any case once you add up all your costs for gas maintenance licensing and insurance you 're left with a very small margin sure a cab company could 3x the number of cabs it normally does at night during the bar rush but the other 16 hours of the day they 're sitting on the lot not doing anything because there is n't as high of demand during the day that costs money and if the cabs are n't working they 're not paying for themselves   thus the market finds a balance between what supply there is depending on time of day and how much it costs to support a fleet of that size the only outside effect on the market equilibrium is how many taxis a city will license i really do n't like the medallion model because of this the medallion owners love it because they 're sitting on upwards of $ 500k asset in some cities

one approach is to control your budget more effectively for example work out your essential living expenses things like food rent and other bills you are committed to and compare this to your regular income   then you can set up a regular automatic payment to a savings account so you limit the disposable income in your current account if you keep a regular check on this balance it should make you feel like you have less spare money and so less temptation to spend on impulse purchases   similarly    it may help to set a savings goal for something you really do want even if this is itself   a bit frivolous it will at least help you to discipline yourself   equally it may be useful to set a fixed budget for luxuries then you have a sense that when it 's gone it 's gone but you do n't have to completely deny yourself

i can answer this question for my jurisdiction florida usa because i lived through it my dad alice passed away in 2008 just as the housing crisis was starting to heat up what happened to the mortgage my dad had a will in place   it was an old will from the 1980 's but never the less a will   we had to provide paperwork to the court that my mom had already passed away and my oldest brother was living out of state he would have been the executor otherwise   with the proper paperwork i became the executor and the property passed in to probate   at this point the estate was responsible for the house and the mortgage on it meaning me as i was the executor we decided to sell the house so we hired a realtor and set an asking price about $ 40k over what was owed on it   as we waited for it to sell i had to make monthly mortgage payments and payments to the hoa otherwise the hoa could put a lien on the property making it more difficult to sell should we find a buyer is it automatically transferred in most jurisdictions i would say not automatic   i definitely had get an estate lawyer and file the proper legal paperwork with the local county courthouse   some states have an easier probate process summary administration in florida that the requirements for small estates is bob expected to pay it off all at once no the mortgage holder was happy for me to make payments out of other estate assets in lieu of my dad   the were earning interest after all   this is probably true in most cases can the house be foreclosed on yes   in our case being 2008 we had a hard time selling the property   the asking price quickly went from $ 40k over what was owed to $ 20k over to $ 10k over then to being equal to the mortgage value   finally i approached the bank about options   they suggested a deed in lieu of foreclosure process   it was easier for us and the bank had to pay less lawyers and such   otherwise a deed in lieu is effectively the same as a foreclosure   at that point we stopped making payments   eventually me and all my siblings the heirs had to sign the proper paperwork giving the house over to the bank in our case the bank did not pursue us or rather the estate for the difference between final auction sale price and the mortgage balance it was an fha loan so the us government wound up picking up the difference   from what i understand this could have happened and we would have wound up with basically nothing out of the estate can the lender force the sale i ca n't give a definite answer on this but it probably depends   if you do n't pay   yes they sure can it 's usually part of the standard mortgage contract   i see 2 other options

the trade off seems to be quite simple how much are you going to get if you sell it against how much are you going to get if you rent it out several people already hinted that the rental revenue may be optimistic i do n't have anything to add to this but keep in mind that if someone pays 45k for your apartment the net gains for you will likely be lower as well another consideration would be that the value of your apartment can change if you expect it to rise steadily you may want to think twice before selling now assuming you have calculated your numbers properly and a near 0 opportunity cost 45,000 right now per year the given numbers imply a return on investment of 14 years or 7.1 personal conclusion i would be surprised if you can actually get a expected net profit for an apartment that rents out at 6k per year but if you are confident the reward seems to be quite nice

if i am interpreting the information in your post correctly then you are completely correct that nycers is by no means worth it there is no dilemma here   in fact i think nycers a worse deal than you are giving it credit for nycers contribution costs you 6.2 of your total income because of the tax implication   the value of contributing to it is only the difference between what you can earn there and what you would earn in your 403(b   it 's not clear whether that is even a positive number   even if it is it is only some small percentage times your contribution amount which is 4.5 of your total income   the benefit of contributing to nycers is minuscule or even nonexistent   there is no way on earth that it makes up for your tax loss remember the 5 interest you get in nycers is that annually or total is compensation for the time value of money   it 's not as valuable as an immediate 5 gain on your contributions and nothing near as valuable as a 5 increase in your income   if you keep your money out of nycers then you can earn capital gains on it elsewhere like in your 403(b or in an ira when it comes to investing legally avoiding taxes is pretty much always top priority   choosing among investments is also important but not nearly as much   in your case the answer seems quite clear   stop contributing to nycers immediately

it is difficult to become a millionaire in the short term a few years working at a job unless you get lucky win the lottery inheritance gambling at a casino etc however if you max out your employer 's retirement plan 401k 403b for the next 30 years and you average a 5 rate of return on your investment you will reach millionaire status   many people would consider this easy and automatic of course this assumes you are able to max our your retirement savings at the start of your career and keep it going   the idea is that if you get in the habit of saving early in your career and live modestly it becomes an automatic thing unfortunately the value of $ 1 million after 30 years of inflation will be eroded somewhat   sorry if you do n't want to wait 30 years then you need to look at a different strategy   work harder or take risks   some options

before the internet there were these things called bulletin board system they were usually privately operated the software ran on a single personal computer and most of the time they had 1 phone line connected to them there were thousands of these systems in every state   visitors would call the phone number and connect in a 1 to 1 conversation the user would then be presented with all sorts of menus and interactive experiences usually with colored text the primary feature of any was the forum called a bulletin board at the time but many also had other things file sharing sections games etc basically everything that the larger internet is used for today   possibly the worst thing that happened to the internet was the dot com boom as a result of a tiny few people getting filthy rich it has created a different landscape where large corporations are kings and it 's very difficult for smaller community projects to find the sort of success they would otherwise enjoy   if the internet were not so ruled by media giants like google and facebook you would see a lot more smaller sites and communities similar to the of old they would have more personality and the experience would probably be better   so no soundcloud does n't matter that much soundcloud started as a small website and they deserve to exist as much as anyone but every time a media giant on the internet collapses we see dozens of small startups take it 's place and the result is often better   there is definitely value in having a central repository i wonder if something like soundcloud could exist decentralized a lot of smaller music sites with preview and purchase features that form a sort of meta network

if you have wage income that is reported on a w2 form you can contribute the maximum of your wages what you can afford or $ 5500 in a roth ira    one advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences so a roth ira can be a deep emergency fund i.e. if the choice is $ 2000 in cash as emergency fund or $ 2000 in cash in a 2015 roth ira contribution choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return   if you let april 15 2016 pass by without making a roth ira contribution you lose the 2015 limit forever   if you are presently a student and partially employed you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades which utilizes the roth tax game effectively    if you 're estimating a few hundred then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions   that is you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose call it $ or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all   at some point you need to understand your emotions around volatility and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have   no reason not to learn this on a few hundred   while it 's not ideal to have losses in a roth a few hundred is not consequential in the long run    if you 're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all or will need the money within a year or few as your edit suggests keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more   can you contribute another $ 100   you will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return

i agree with that you may be well advised to pay off your loans first and go from there   even though you may not be required to make payments on your own loan based on your income that debt will play a large factor in your borrowing ability until it is gone which hinders your ability to move toward home ownership    if you are in a fortunate enough position to totally pay off both your loan and hers from cash on hand then you should   it would still leave you with more than $ and no debt which is a big priority and advantage for a young couple mind you this does n't keep you from starting an investment plan with some portion of the remaining funds the advice to keep six months income in the bank is very wise through perhaps a mutual fund if you do n't want to directly manage the investments yourself   the advantage of mutual funds is the ability to choose the level of risk you 're willing to take and let professionals manage how to achieve your goals for you   you can always make adjustments to your funds as your circumstances change again i 'd emphasize yourself of the student loan debt as the first move then looking at how to invest the remainder

here 's what you do without on the negative side just for balance a bill when i last had comprehensive insurance it cost something like 3 4 of the value of the car per annum   obviously ymmv enormously but i think that 's somewhere near the middle of the range and i 'm not especially risky   so compared to the total depreciation and running costs of the car it 's actually fairly substantial   over the say 10 years i might keep that car it adds up to a fair slice of what it will take to buy a replacement financial crisis costs i do n't know about you but my insurance went up something like 30 in recent years despite the value insured and the risk going down said by the insurer to be due to market turmoil   so at least hundreds of dollars is just kind of loss and i 'd rather not pay it with the insurer if you have insurance and a loss you have to persuade them to pay out perhaps document the original conditions or the fault perhaps argue about whether their payment is fair   i 've done this for small non automotive claims and it added up to more hassle than the incident itself   obviously all insurers will claim they 're friendly to deal with but until you actually have a big claim you never know moral hazard i know i 'm solely responsible for not having my car crashed or stolen   somehow that just feels better free riders i 've seen people fudge their insurance claims so that things that should n't have been covered were claimed to be   you might have too   buy insurance and you 're paying for them choice insurers are typically going to make the decision for you about whether a claim is or not and in my experience are reluctant or refuse to just give you the cash amount of the claim see also moral hazard   do it yourself and you can choose whether to live with it make a smaller or larger repair or replace the whole vehicle with a second hand one or a brand new one or indeed perhaps do without a vehicle a distraction hopefully by the time you 've been working for a while a vehicle is not a really large fraction of your net worth   if you lose 10 of your net worth it 's not really nice but well you could easily have lost that off the value of your house or your retirement portfolio in recent years   what you actually need to insure is genuinely serious risks that would seriously change your life if they were lost such as your ability to work   for about the same cost as insuring a $ x car you can insure against $ x income every year for the rest of your life and i think it 's far more important if i have a write off accident but walk away i 'll be perfectly happy and obviously liability insurance is important because being hit for $ millions of liabilities could also have a serious impact    coverage for mechanical failures if your car needs a new transmission insurance is n't going to help yet it may cost more than the typical minor collision   save the money yourself and you can manage those costs out of the same bucket flexibility if you save up to replace your car but some other crisis occurs you can choose to put the money towards that   if you have car insurance but you have a family medical thing it 's no help i think the bottom line is insure against costs you could n't cope with by yourself   there are people who need a car but can just barely afford it but if you 're fortunate enough not to be in that case you do n't really need comprehensive insurance

they 're wrong and it 's easy to show that if you pay the same in taxes then you end up the same either way if you have an initial investment of 10k an effective tax rate of 25 and gains of 10 a year here are the numbers you invest 10k into a traditional after 50 years you have $   after paying taxes you end up with $ you invest 10k into a roth after paying the taxes your initial investment is $ 7500 after 50 years you have $ the same you have with the traditional the advantage from the roth comes from two things the assumption that taxes are lower now for you than they will be in the future a good bet given that taxes are relatively low in the us and the ability to have a mix of taxable and non taxable income to draw from in retirement to lower your effective tax rate draw down the taxable up to a certain tax bracket then use your non taxable above that

bp holdings management on taxes and thier original intents is designed to generate enough revenue to sustain essential public service such as public safety civil infrastructure for communication and transportation and basic health services when you see a government hospital you know your taxes support the upkeep of that institution and when you see soldiers fighting in you can be sure tax went into training them and keeping them fit and equipped to preserve our national security    as essential as tax is to our national existence many do not know the true value of what taxes can do other than what we have mentioned above here are some generally unknown facts about taxes and what you need to do to make full use of their benefits    1 taxes should not favour one group over another   taxes are intended to be neutral and must not cater to any one sector or group of people over another neither should it impose or interfere with individual decision making    what this signifies is that taxes as they were originally conceived had an altruistic purpose meant to benefit people equally without favoring any individual or any societal unit it is a fund to provide services and public amenities for all people alike so whether you earn only so much or make millions you walk or drive over the same road or bridge that taxes helped to build we can not discount the goodwill and welfare taxes have brought to both ancient and modern societies   pay your taxes so you can enjoy them    2 taxes must be predictable    in order for a government to function well it must have some stability in terms of its fiscal health without the necessary funds to run a government chaos would ensue and so taxes must flow into a state ’s coffers at a regular schedule and at a reasonably predictable amount or the oil will run out at a time when the engine of progress badly needs it    now we understand why the state imposes and does not merely request that taxes be paid at a particular time of the year why april for many countries it is the time of the year when people have probably paid off last year ’s debts or recovered from the expenses of the holiday season in the previous year it is also the time when most parents have extra cash because their children are on school vacation unfortunately it is also the time when many people want to spend a vacation so it is either you pay your tax or spend a nice vacation during spring for most people    3 taxes must be simple   assessment and computation of tax and determination should be easily understood by the average taxpayer but this has been forgotten by tax officials in recent years it has not only become more complex in terms of schedule as the tax calendar seems to nowadays it has also become so hard to decipher through the many pages now incorporated in the tax return the best thing to do if you have extra cash is to let an accountant do your tax    4 taxes must not be forced but enforced to encourage voluntary compliance   the key is convenience as much as possible it is the tax duty to encourage voluntary compliance among taxpayers through creative implementation without making people feel they are being harassed or unduly burdened ordinary taxpayers have to go through a lot of stress figuring out forms and lining up to pay their tax perhaps a more convenient way can be implemented using modern technology and the banking system if we can pay bills in malls or online now why can not tax be paid in the same way    5 taxes earmarked for specific purposes must result in direct benefits   certain taxes such as gasoline tax for road maintenance must be dedicated to the particular purpose they were intended based on a direct cost benefit link today much of the corruption in government circles arise from taxes or diverting them from their intended purposes thus losing sight of the original intent of the tax    what can the taxpayer do to prevent these things from happening aside from joining protest rallies or talking to your congress representative you can actually form or join small groups that could create awareness among people through the media or internet this is already being done on facebook and twitter how effective it is may be hard to measure but time will come when a critical mass of concerned people will have a force of a virtual army that can change the tide of events in a society    inevitable as taxes may be enjoying their ultimate benefits can be a much better motivation that spending our time looking for ways to avoid them

boiler feed are an important part of any boiler operation they control the amount of water fed to the boiler and the manner in which it is fed   continuous intermittent   in order to properly select a boiler feed pump five key points must be considered   will the pumps operation be continuous or intermittent   this is an operational question and is often answered by the type of level control found on the boiler that the pump will be servicing as a general rule of thumb boilers with a capacity of 10,000 or less utilize a float type switch that starts and stops the boiler feed pump to satisfy a predetermined water level within the boiler this is a classic intermittent operation   boilers with capacities exceeding 10,000 typically employs a feed water regulator and will continuously feed water to the boiler at various rates depending upon the water level in the boiler    by knowing which operation you are to satisfy you can determine which pump design is best suited for your application as a general rule of thumb a pump is used in an on off situation and a pump is used for continuous operation but remember this is a general rule and is some cases a could be used for an on off application and a for continuous    what is the temperature of the water being pumped   it is also important to know the temperature of water you intend to pump most pumps can usually handle of to f other pumps are available that can handle higher temperatures by using external water cooling keep in mind that a pump must be able to handle higher temperatures because they operate a 5 or f.    what is the required capacity   how much water you intend to pump is dependent upon the evaporation rate of the boiler the pump will service a safe figure for an on off application would be 2 times the evaporation rate of the boiler with a level control a factor of 1.3 times the evaporation rate plus is recommended    what is the desired discharge pressure   when you pump directly into the boiler you will need to overcome the pressure in the boiler as well as any piping losses you can chose the right pump by looking at the pump curves to determine which will accomplish this task should you have a valve in the discharge line the minimum you will need to add to the boiler operating pressure will be 20 to 25 lbs make sure that the pump can handle the pressure along with the flow rate needed with an on off level control the pumps should be designed for the relief valve pressure   what is the or net positive head required   this is the last piece of information that you will need this is the minimum absolute pressure at the at which the pump can operate to avoid pump the of the system must be greater than the of the pump in other words the available must be higher than the required we have always sized our stands to be two feet higher than the needed for the pump selection remember the water level in the storage tank adds to the safety margin

you have a lack of credit history   lending is still tight since the recession and companies are n't as willing to take a gamble on people with no history the secured credit card is the most direct route to building credit right now i do n't think you 're going to be applicable for a department store card pointless anyways and encourages wasteful spending nor the gas card gas cards are credit cards funded through a bank just like any ordinary credit card only you are limited to gas purchases at a particular retailer although gas cards department store cards and other limited usage types of credit cards have less requirements in this post financial crisis economy credit is still stringent and a no history file is too risky for banks to take on having multiple hard inquiries wo n't help either you do have a full time job that pays well so the $ 500 deposit should n't be a problem for the secured credit card after 6 months you 'll get it back anyways just remember to pay off in full every month after 6 months you 'll be upgraded to a regular credit card and you will have established credit history

options can have a negligible time premium for calls the time premium is never negative if it had a negative premium it would be profitable to exercise it immediately a deep in the money call has a delta of exactly one that is it 's price movements completely mirror the price movements of the underlying stock that means an option seller can buy stock and completely hedge his short option position the seller of the option may be in an position to buy with very little margin and take your money and invest it for example consider a stock trading at $ 7.50 with its january 2014    $ 4 call option trading at $ 3.50 for one option representing 100 shares a trader could take your 350 dollars and invest it and only use a small portion of the money to buy the stock on margin market makers can typically borrow money at very low interest rates if you have high borrowing costs or are unable to buy on margin then buying deep in the money calls can be a good strategy long story short option sellers are making money off selling these deep in the money calls even with almost zero time premium so in general there 's no way to make money by buying them 1 an american call is a call that can be exercised at any time up to and including its expiration date

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

by your own logic this may not work tax cuts which are matched by government spending cuts will have an immediate negative effect on the economy as government spending contributes a very sizeable chunk of the gdp and employs a not at all insignificant workforce   thus for the net total economic growth to compensate at the very least that entire tax cuts has to be spent in the economy preferably in sectors where the income velocity of money is the highest income velocity has often been proven to be the highest among the low income sections while the lowest among the high income sections for example if the corporate tax cuts is just invested as share buybacks the net velocity is tiny even though share prices will increase   what proof do you really have that this will not be case let alone 35 years even recent data has shown that increasing the monetary supply to corporate america does not really translate to sustained gdp growth as the money velocity remains abysmal this has been demonstrated both on a state level in kansas and in a slightly different way at the federal level through our experience with quantitative easing

i gather from your mention of stamp duty that you 're in britain   i 'm only familiar with us cards but for them i ca n't see that there is any reason other than a lack of self discipline not to use a credit card wherever possible especially these days 1 there are plenty of cards with no annual fee 2 you get anywhere from 1 5 discount cash back on purchases 3 many will give you sign up bonuses and a year or more of zero interest   so you put that money in your investment account and odds are you make a profit on it 4 even after the introductory 0 interest period you get on average about a month of 0 interest between purchase and due date during which period the money can be earning interest for you i 've made a good many thousands of dollars over the years doing this   again the only drawback i can see is that you may not have the self discipline to pay off the accounts before they start charging interest

short selling can be a good strategy to hedge but you have almost unlimited downside   if a stock price skyrockets you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital a smarter strategy to hedge that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down   your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more another way to hedge is to sell calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to   you might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you did n't want to sell your shares right now   that way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option you 'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that

this is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point   first google and others essentially have in house investment banking departments that are vetting valuing negotiating and sealing these deals these m&amp;a guys are mostly former bankers    so while they may not be using investment banks they are certainly using bankers google has $ in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year it 's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in house    second certain tech companies like google and facebook and zynga have unique corporate structures where the ceo founders retain majority voting control of their companies    this means guys like zuckerberg page brin et al control over 50 of all voting shares and they can not be ousted by the board of directors nor can they be on any matter via a proxy battle this gives these founders far reaching control over m&amp;a and thus you see deals like the $ cash + stock whatsapp acquisition and instagram both of these deals were reportedly driven by zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals but determined the price    most ceos do not have this kind of latitude    third within silicon valley the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other the ceos founders vcs etc they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire   it 's not like zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out snapchat

you 'd have to check the terms of your contract on most installment loans i think they calculate interest monthly not daily that is if you make 3 payments of $ 96 over the course of the month instead of one payment of $ at the end of the month but before the due date it makes absolutely zero difference to their interest calculation they just total up your payments for the month that 's how my mortgage works and how some past loans i 've had worked all you 'd accomplish is to cost yourself some time postage if you 're mailing payments and waste the bank 's time processing multiple payments if the loan allows you to make pre payments which i think most loans today do then what does work is to make an extra payment or an overpayment if you have a few hundred extra dollars make an extra payment this reduces your principle and reduces the amount of interest you pay every month for the remainder of the loan and if you 're paying $ 1 less in interest then that extra dollar goes against principle which further reduces the amount you pay in interest the next month this and can save you a lot in the long run better still instead of paying $ each month pay say $ 300 then every month you 're away at the principle faster and faster for example i calculate that if you 're paying $ per month you 'll pay the loan off in 72 months and pay a total of $ in interest pay $ 300 per month and you 'll pay it off in 67 months with a total of $ interest okay not a huge deal pay $ 350 per month and you pay it off in 55 months with $ interest i just did quick calculations with a spreadsheet not accurate to the penny but close enough for comparison ps this is different from revolving credit like credit cards where interest is calculated on the average daily balance with a credit card making multiple payments would indeed reduce your interest but not by much if you pay $ 100 every 10 days instead of $ 300 at the end then you 're saving the interest on 20 days x $ 100 + 10 days x $ 100 so 12.5 = 0.03 per day so 0.03 x $ = 90 cents if you 're mailing your payments the postage is 49 cents x 2 extra payments = 98 cents you 're losing 8 cents per month by doing this

you 'll need to check paypal 's terms of service for that first question i would imagine you could as my wife and i both have personal paypal accounts listed at the same address when you receive money the will only see the full name on your account the amount and the transaction id if you set up a business account the name on your account will be replaced with the company name your mailing address will not be made visible yes paypal provides an export option of your transaction history for reference if your volume greater than $ 20,000 across 200 or more transactions then they 'll be issuing a 1099-k form anyway that depends on the payment method bank transfers are instant where cards require a settlement delay paypal provides buyer protection so i 'd be very in logging all of your work done to provide proof of completion in case someone disputes a payment disputes can take place up to 45 days from the date of the transaction chargebacks can take place 120 days or more after the transaction depends on the card network

i have n't heard 30-year mortgages called unwise as said the shorter terms often will be cheaper if you are going to pay off within that term anyway but the extra cost of the 30 may still be justified because it gives you the safety net of being able to fall back to the lower payment if money gets tight cheap insurance if you might need that insurance that was n't something i was worried about so i took a 20-year later refinanced as 15-year and got a slightly better rate by doing so consider how long you expect to own this house and shop for the best deal you can find remember to figure points into the real cost the loan there are calculators on many bank credit union websites that can help you do this comparison

i too was very confused when i tried to be tricky and paid down my balance before the bill date i thought this would be a great thing because it would show my utilization near zero percent the opposite happen it dropped my credit score from to here is the best example i can come up with when it comes to utilization lets pretend you are an insurance company and you trying to figure out who are the best risk drivers the people that drive 10 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 50 of the day the people that drive 50 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 90 of the day here is the rub when people drive 0 when you look at the people at 0 they appear to be walking or flying what they are not doing is driving since they are not driving using credit they are viewed as poor drivers since they are not keeping up on their driving skills paying bills watching how they spend and managing their debt so now before the billing date i pay down my balance to something between 5 to 10 of my utilization after the bill is issued i pay it off in full i am not going to pay these crazy interest rates what shows up on my credit report is a person that is driving his credit between 5 and 10 utilization it shows i know i how to manage my revolving accounts i know it 's dumb you would think they reward people that have zero debt i do n't hate banks i hate the game i do love me some reward points =)

you have several questions in your post so i 'll deal with them individually is taking small sums from your ira really that detrimental i mean as far as tax is concerned percentage wise you pay the tax on the amount plus a 10 penalty plus the opportunity cost of the gains that the money would have gotten   at 6 growth annually in 5 years that 's more than a 34 loss   there are much cheaper ways to get funds than tapping your ira is n't the 10 penalty really to cover ss and the medicare tax that you did not pay before putting money into your retirement no you still pay ss and medicare on your gross income 401(k contributions just reduce how much you pay in income tax   the 10 penalty is to dissuade you from using retirement money before you retire if i contributed that to my ira before taxes including ss and medicare tax that money would gain 6 interest again you would still pay ss and medicare and like you say there 's no guarantee that you 'll earn 6 on your money   i do n't think you can pay taxes up front when making an early withdrawal from an ira can you   this one you got right   when you file your taxes your ira contributions for the year are totaled up and are deducted from your gross income for tax purposes there 's no tax effect when you make the contribution would it not be better to contribute that $ 5500 to my ira and if i did n't need it great let it grow but if i did need it toward the end of the year do an early withdrawal so what do you plan your tax withholdings against   do you plan on keeping it there reducing your withholdings and pay a big tax bill plus possibly penalties if you need it   or do you plan to take it out and have a big refund when you file your taxes you might be better off saving that up in a savings account during the year and if at the end of the year you did n't use it then make an ira contribution which will lower the taxes you pay   do n't use your ira as a hopeful savings account so if i needed to withdrawal $ 5500 and i am in the 25 tax bracket i would owe the government $ 1925 in 10 penalty so if i withdrew $ to cover the tax and penalty i would then be taxed $ 2600 an additional $ 675 sounds like a cat chasing it 's tail trying to cover the tax yes if you take a withdrawal to pay the taxes if you pay the tax with non retirement money then the cycle stops how can i make a withdrawal from an ira without having to pay tax on tax pay cash for the tax and penalty rather then taking another withdrawal to pay the tax   if you ca n't afford the tax and penalty in cash then do n't withdraw at all based on this year 's w-2 form i had an accountant do my taxes and the $ 27 k loan was added as earned income then in another block there was the $ 2700 amount for the penalty so you paid 25 in income tax for the earned income and an additional 10 penalty   so in your case it was a 35 overall tax instead of the 40 rule of thumb since many people are in 28 and 35 tax brackets the bottom line is it sounds like you are completely unorganized and have absolutely no margin to cover any unexpected expenses   i would stop contributing to retirement today until you can get control of your spending get on a budget and stop trying to use your ira as a piggy bank   if you do n't plan on using the money for retirement then do n't put it in an ira   stop borrowing from it and getting into further binds that force you to make bad financial decisions you do n't go into detail about any other aspects mortgage car loans consumer debt to even begin to know where the real problem is   so you need to write everything down that you own and you owe write out your monthly expenses and income and figure out what you can cut if needed in order to build up some cash savings until then you 're driving across country in a car with no tires worrying about which highway will give you the best gas mileage

these government mandates of minimum wage will cause more problems than they will solve i do n't know how many of you own a small business but i can give you a real world example here in the city of chicago on july 1st 2017 the minimum wage will increase to $ while at the same time they 're introducing a .01 per oz sugar tax   the amount of additional work needed to keep track of sugar consumption will be burdensome for small businesses who will have to raise prices to accommodate the new labor costs and tax customers are price sensitive so they will usually go for the cheaper option which can be provided only by corporate big business who have the ability to automate certain positions in the labor supply chain which is currently happening i would n't be surprised if the timeline for kiosks self service robot implementation is on par with the $ 15.00 minimum wage deadline in 2019 to sum up big business wins and labor loses but i guess results do n't matter when your intentions are good

paying off your student loan is an investment and a completely risk free one   every payment of your loan is a purchase of debt at the interest rate of the loan    it would be extremely unusual to be able to find a cd bond or other low risk play at a better rate   any investment in a risky asset such as stocks is just leveraging up your personal balance sheet which is strictly a personal decision based on your risk appetite but would nearly universally be regarded as a mistake by a financial advisor   the only exception i can think of here would be taking out a home mortgage and even that would be debatable unless your loan interest rate is in the range of corporate or government bonds and i 'm sure it is n't do n't think twice about paying them off with any free cash you have

in summary in long form spreads and shorts are not allowed in cash accounts except for covered options brokers will allow clients to roll option positions in a single transaction which look like spreads but these are not actually sell to open transactions sell to open is forbidden in cash accounts short positions from closing the long half of a covered trade are day trading is allowed in both margin and cash accounts however pattern day trading only applies to margin accounts and requires a minimum account balance of $ 25,000 cash accounts are free to buy and sell the same security on the same day over and over provided that there is sufficient buying power to pay for opening a new position since proceeds are held for both stock and option sales in a cash account that means buying power available at the start of the day will drop with each purchase and not rise again until settlement unsettled funds are available immediately within margin accounts without restriction in cash accounts using unsettled funds to purchase securities will require you to hold the new position until funds settle otherwise your account will be blocked for free riding legally you can buy securities in a cash account without available cash on deposit with the broker but most brokers do n't allow this and some will aggressively liquidate any position that you are somehow able to enter for which you did n't have available cash already on deposit in a margin account margin can help gloss over the few days between purchase and deposit allowing you to be somewhat more aggressive in investing funds a margin account will allow you to make an investment if you feel the opportunity is right before requiring you to deposit the funds see a great opportunity with sufficient margin you can open the trade immediately and then run to the bank to deposit funds rather than being stuck waiting for funds to be credited to your account margin accounts might show up on your credit report the possibility of losing more than you invested having positions liquidated when you least expect it your broker doing possibly stupid things in order to close out an over account and other consequences are all very serious risks of margin accounts although you mentioned awareness of this issue any answer is not complete with mentioning those risks

i think your analysis is very clear it 's a sensible approach and the numbers sound about right to me a few other things you might want to think about tax in some jurisdictions you can deduct mortgage interest against your income tax i see from your profile that you 're in texas but i do n't know the exact situation there and i think it 's better to keep this answer general anyway if that 's the case for you then you should re run your numbers taking that into account you may also be able to make your investments tax advantaged for example if you save them in a retirement account you 'll need to apply the appropriate limits for your specific situation and take an educated guess as to how that might change over the next 30 years liquidity the money you 're not spending on your mortgage is money that 's available to you for other spending or emergencies i.e. even though your default assumption is to invest it and that 's a sensible way to compare with the mortgage you might still place some extra value on having more free access to it overpayments would you have the option to pay extra on the mortgage that 's another way of investing your money that gets you a guaranteed return of the mortgage rate you might want to consider if you 'd want to send some of your excess money that way

i recommend you take a look at this lecture really the whole series is enlightening from swenson he identifies 3 sources of returns diversification timing and selection he appears to discard timing and selection as impossible a student kinda calls him out on this diversification reduces risk not increase returns it turns out they did time the market by shorting .com 's before the bubble and real estate just before the downturn in 1990 yale started a absolute return unit and allocated like 15 percent to it mostly by selling us equities that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves as for why you might employ managers for specific areas consider that the expense ratio wall street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in yale 's portfolio so they hire internally to reduce expenses and i 'm sure they 're kept busy they also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge finally in some areas you functionally can not invest without management for example yale has a substantial allocation in private equity and by definition that does n't trade on the open market the other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009 for a technique that 's supposed to reduce volatility they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years

would love to see it happen but unfortunately agree with you there is already demand for a non cable isp but telecoms have dug in for the long fight and are actively fighting these out of existence   combine this with the fact that new media still needs to get it 's content from somewhere and a ton of this content is owned by cable providers they were willing to experiment with these new media sources when they were a tiny slice of the pie but now that new media is gaining mass market appeal they want to massively overcharge for content to either a drive the companies out of business or b continue reaping their insane profits the telecoms essentially have a monopoly and are using that to prolong the existence of dying businesses   i see this playing out in one of several ways   1 the government up and either breaks up the monopolies or allows internet to become available through other means as a public utility or allowing these mom and pop isp 's to exist do n't know about the rest of the world but it will be a while before this happens in the us   2 new media providers find way to distribute and market independent content and rid themselves of at least one factor holding them back unfortunately most people do n't seem to be interested in independent content i would suspect this is largely due to these companies owning the vertical and telling you what you should watch as well   3 these companies die a long slow and painful death at the hands of piracy at which point a sane and legal way of getting content is free to exist without being out of existence

the idea behind investing in index funds is that you will not under perform the market but also at the same time not over perform against the market either it is meant for those majority of the investing population who do not or can not invest more time in actively researching different investment options so even considering for a moment that the yields on the index funds will drop significantly in the future since the fund is supposed to be replication of the whole market itself the market too can be assumed to be giving significantly lower future yields in my opinion the question that you ask is confusing contradictory because its like pegging the fund performance to an avg and then asking if it will be higher or lower in the future but rather its always going to be exactly the average even if the absolute yields turn higher or lower

it 's always hard to know the exact policy terms but as a general rule there are two main contributions to insurance payouts the first part covers expenses aimed at restoring the situation to its previous state pre incident this may include repair work and materials etcetera the second part kicks in when it 's not reasonably possible to repair the damage or at least not in a financially efficient way in this case the insurer can decide to pay out the decrease in value this is in fact very common in car accidents where the car is a total loss   in your case it 's quite possible that your roof even with the two partial repairs is in a worse condition than it was before the storm for instance the new shingles may not match the old ones exactly thus the value of your home has decreased despite the reasonable repair attempt and as mhoran_psprep points out there can be hidden damage as well which is a liability if you 've accepted the cash payment in lieu of a full repair you also accept the roof in its new condition

first you will need a plan stating three main points you will have to decide what criteria you will use to answer these points you might use fundamental analysis to find what to buy and technical analysis to decide when to buy and when to sell your buy and sell triggers once you have a trading plan in place you would need to find a broker with conditional orders you can place conditional buy orders to get in a trade for example if the price moves above or below a target price you can place conditional stop loss orders if your trade goes against you and you can also place conditional profit target stops to automatically get out if rises to your desired profit target you can place one two or many conditional orders after hours which will enable you to trade without being in front of your screen all day long

if you do n't have a good knowledge of finance maybe you should not put too much money in individual stocks but if you really want to invest you can just compare the rate of return of the most known stocks available to you like the one from the s&p for the us the rate of return is very simple to compute it 's share price for example a company with a current share price of usd that delivered a dividend of usd last year would have a rate of return of 100 now if you only invest in the most known stocks since they are already covered by nearly all financial institutions and analysts if you are looking for lower risk dividend companies take a sample of companies and invest those with the lowest rates of return but avoid extreme values of course since the stock prices are changing all the time you have to compare them with a price taken at the same time like the closing price of a specific day and for the dividend they can be on several basis yearly etc so you have to be sure to take the same basis you can also find the p e ratio which is the opposite indicator (= share price dividend so an higher p e ratio means a lower risk most of the time you can find the p e ratio or the rate of return already computed on specialized website or brokers

gt no the main difference is dividends do n't take shares out of the marketplace to artificially inflate a quarters eps because buyback decreases shares outstanding it also decreases the company 's total future dividend payouts as well   you have no idea what you are talking about   buybacks are almost exclusively better for shareholders than dividends because they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   the fact that corporate buybacks have increased so much lately at the expense of dividends is a sign of good management by insiders

it is possible to consolidate mortgages with nationwide in some circumstances quote from their website it is possible to consolidate different mortgages and other debts such as personal loans and credit cards however it does depend on your individual circumstances including the exact type of loans you want to consolidate and whether you are still in a special deal period i personally would be amazed if you could n't get them all in one mortgage without changing provider but i would n't be at all surprised if they forced you to have this one mortgage as a new mortgage rather than adding balances to an existing one my reasoning is as follows coming at it from a different angle whatever there was that required your further borrowing to be in new mortgages rather than added to your existing mortgage will also preclude your multiple mortgages being added to one of your existing mortgages

has mentioned this in a comment but i think it ought to be expanded upon companies that are n't already penny stocks really do n't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest   short selling does not inherently lower the stock price not any more so than any other kind of selling   when somebody shorts a stock it 's simply borrowed from another investor 's margin as long as it 's not a naked short resulting in an failure to deliver then it does not add any artificial selling pressure in fact shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls   not a guarantee of course but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short squeeze resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest   many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal compare with margin buying essentially the opposite of short selling which has the opposite effect   if investors buy stocks on margin then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction   shorting is in a sense evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits bottom line is that aside from illegal insider trading it does n't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity   yes a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they 'd be able to raise because it does n't change the actual market cap and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price   if a company 's market cap is $ 1 billion then it does n't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $ 50.00 each or 10 million shares at $ 5.00 each either way it nets them $ 50 million from the sale and causes a 5 dilution to which the market will react accordingly they do n't do it because there 'd be no point

to me it depends on things like your net worth debt and how other assets are invested    currently you have 25 k invested in the company you work for    if you have 100 k in student loans are a renter and 12 k in your 401 k then i would recommend exercising almost all of your options   in that case you have a much to large part of your world wrapped up in your company if you have 250 k in your 401 k own a home and have an emergency fund with no debt then you are fine with letting it ride   you can afford to absorb a loss of 25 k without wrecking your net worth more than likely you are somewhere in between just statistics speaking there   so why not exercise some of them now with the purpose of improving your financial situation   say do a 1/3 now and when they come available    when 401ks were first invented people put almost all of their money in their company stock   they lost just about everything when the company went down in value and were often a victim of layoffs the issue   this is akin to the same situation   most financial advisers recommend against putting any 401 k money to company stock or at least limiting the amount

before you are married i recommend keeping your finances separate   however once you are married i recommend combining your finances completely in my opinion marriage works best when you work together as a team a single unit   you no longer have his money and her money or his income and her income   nor is there his debt and her debt   there is only our money our income our debt and our budget    indeed if you are the one with less debt is n't it in your household 's best interest to help eliminate your spouse 's debt as fast as possible   if you are the one with more income employment how do you quantify the monetary value of the spouse who stays at home more and manages the household   you ca n't and it is best not to try   instead pool together all income and expenses and work together to meet common goals to do this open up a joint bank account and close your individual accounts meet on a regular basis to decide your household budget   if you do that it does n't matter who is responsible for the mechanics of paying the bills or balancing the budget   these tasks just get assigned to someone just like any other household chore usually one of you will be more financially minded than the other and that person will take the lead in setting the budget paying the bills balancing the checkbook etc   however it is important that both people are aware of what is going on and have access to the financial information    in our house i am the one who takes the lead on financial matters   i pay the bills out of our joint accounts and set the monthly budget using ynab software   however my wife has the ability to look at ynab at any time to see the budget and she can log into the bank website to see the transactions there as well   no secrets to be clear we each have a small amount of cash fun money that we can spend without worrying about checking in with the spouse on every little thing   but this is a small percentage of our budget and we talk to each other before spending any significant amount of money

if you are in a position to have information that will impact the shares of a stock or index fund and you use that information for either personal gain or to mitigate the losses that you would have felt then it is insider trading   even if in the end your quiet period passes with little or no movement of the stocks in question   it is the attempt to benefit from or the appearance of the attempt to benefit from inside information that creates the crime   this is the reason for the quiet periods to attempt to shield the majority of the companies employees from the appearance of as well as any actual with an index you are running a double edged sword because anything that is likely to cause apple to drop 10 is likely to give a bump to motorola google and its competitors   so you could end up in jail for insider trading and lose your shirt on a poor decision to short a tech   etf on knowledge that will cause apple to take a hit   it is certainly going to be harder to find the trade but the sec is good at looking around for activity that is inconsistent with normal trading patterns of individuals in a position to have knowledge with the type of market impact you are talking about
