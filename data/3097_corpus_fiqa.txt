i compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends hard to find however managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard   after discussing with many in the real estate world i counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 8 on real estate after taxes   this does not include anything else like dilip mentions maintenance insurance etc   for those who want to avoid that route you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or reit funds like dilip mentions   however they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this in terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed   we wo n't our need for real estate but we wo n't our need for food or tangible goods either   you can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund finally one of your best investments is your career field software   do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start up it 's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set or create a site which generates passive revenue again not that hard   one software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation think of a smart phone application that you build once yet continues to generate revenue   this was right before the crash and after it everyone talked about another lost decade   while it does require extra work initially like all things software related you 'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications meaning your first one may be the most difficult all it takes in this case is one really good idea

if you 're looking for a well rounded view into what it 's like to actually own manage real estate investments plus how you can scale things up keep the management workload relatively low have a look at the bigger pockets community   there are blogs podcasts interviews there from both full time part time real estate investors it 's been a great resource for me in my investments more generally your goal of retiring within 20 years is very attainable even without getting extravagant investment returns   a very underrated determinant in how quickly you build wealth is how much of your income you are contributing to investments have a look at this article the shockingly simple math behind early retirement

real estate investment is a proven creator of wealth   check into the history of the rich and you will find real estate investment starting your investment in multi family is a great idea   it is a good way to gain experience in real estate while exponentially increasing cash flow if you turn the properties over to a reputable property management company your cash flow will be a little less but so will your headaches expect to pay 8 10 of gross income you could start investing now by looking into discounted real estate such as foreclosures tax sales short sales etc while the market is still depressed   this way your return on investment should be higher from there you could expand into land development i.e. or commercial investments commercial properties with triple net leases can be a great low stress investment opportunity but they take more cash upfront attending some local real estate investment classes would be a great idea for starters

your post seems to read as if you want to invest only in real estate rental properties as a start because they will be a reliable investment guaranteed to generate profits that you will be plowing back into buying even more rental properties but you are willing to consider possibly in later years other forms of investment in real estate that will not require active   participation in the management of the rental properties while many participants here do own rental real estate and even manage it entirely for most people that is only a small part of their investment portfolio and i suspect that hardly any will recommend real estate as the only investment the way you seem to want to do also you might want to look more closely at the realities of rental real estate   operations before jumping in things are not necessarily as rosy as they appear to you now   not all your units will be rented all the time and the rental income might not always be enough to cover the mortgage payments and the property taxes and the insurance payments and the repairs and maintenance and depreciation of the property is another matter that you might not have thought about that being said you can invest in real estate through real estate investment trusts reits or through limited partnerships where you have only a passive role   there are even mutual funds that invest in reits or in reit indexes

investment banks do n't have to buy anything if they do n't think the stock is worth buying they wo n't if they think it is others on the secondary market will probably think so too initial public offering is offering to the public i.e. theoretically anyone can participate and purchase stocks the major investment firms are not buying the stocks for themselves but for their clients who are participating in this ipo i for example receive email notifications from my brokerage firm each time there 's another ipo that they have access to and i can ask the brokerage to buy stocks from the ipo on my behalf when that happens they do n't buy the stocks themselves and then sell to me no what happens is that i buy a stock through them and they charge me a commission for the service usually ipo participation commissions are higher than regular trading commissions most of the time those who purchase stocks at ipo are institutional investors i.e. mutual funds pension plans investment banks for their managed accounts etc retail investors would probably not participate in the ipo because of the costs limited access not all the brokerage firms have access to all the ipos and the uncertainty and rather purchase the stocks later on a secondary market

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

you 're losing money and a lot of it consider this the inflation is 2 4 a year officially depending on your spending pattern your own rate might be quite higher you earn about 1/2 i.e. you 're losing 3 a year guaranteed you can do much better without any additional risk 0.1 on savings account why not 0.9 on line savings account ally american express e*trade etc give much higher rates than what you have current ally rates are 0.9 on a regular savings account 9 times more than what you have with no additional risk its a fdic insured deposit you can get a slightly higher rate with cds at the same bank for 12 months deposit ira why is it in cd 's its the longest term investment you have that 's where you can and should take risks to maximize your compounding returns not doing that is actually more risky to you because you 're guaranteeing compounding loss of the said 3 a year on average more volatile stock investments have shown to be not losing money over periods of decades even if they do lose money over shorter periods rental if you can buy a property that you would pay the same amount of money for as for a comparable rental you should definitely buy your debt will be secured by the property and since you 're paying the same amount or less you 're earning the equity there 's no risk here just benefits which again you chose to forgo in the worst case if you default and walk away from the property you lost exactly or less what you would have paid for a rental anyway 14 years old car may be cheaper than 4 years old to buy but consider the maintenance licensing and repairs will it not some up to more than the difference in my experience it is likely to bottom line you think you 're risk averse but you 're exactly the opposite of that

i 'll add this to others having non deductible portion in your ira requires additional tax forms to be attached to your tax return and tracking if you plan to have long term investments in your non deductible ira such as say target funds or long term stock positions that you expect to hold till retirement it may be better to keep them in a non ira account this is because the income tax on the withdrawals from the ira is at ordinary rates and from the regular investment account is at capital gains rate while the rates can definitely change traditionally capital gains rates are significantly lower than the ordinary income bracket rates so generally i think that having non deductible ira deposits is only useful if you 're planning a roth conversion in a near future

note   this is not professional tax advice   if you think you need professional tax advice find a licensed professional in your local area what are the expected earnings year us$ 100 us$ 1,000   us$ 100,000   i would say if this is for us$ 1,000 or less that registering an ein and consulting a cpa to file a partnership tax return is not going to be a profitable exercise all the earnings perhaps more will go to paying someone to do or help do the tax filings the simplest taxes are for a business that you completely own   corporations and partnerships involve additional forms and get more and more and complex and even more so when it involves foreign participation   partnerships are often not formal partnerships but can be more easily thought of as independent businesses that each participants owns that are simply doing some business with each other schedule c is the irs form you fill out for any businesses that you own on schedule c you would list the income from advertising   also on schedule c there is a place for all of the business expenses such as ads that you buy a server that you rent supplies employees and independent contractors   amounts paid to an independent contractor certainly need not be based on hours but could be a fixed fee or based on profit earned    finally if you pay anyone in the usa over a certain amount you have to tell the irs about that with a form 1099 at the beginning of the next year so they can fill out their taxes   but according to an article in international tax blog you might not have to file form 1099 with the irs for foreign contractors if they are not us persons not a us citizen or a resident visa holder

short answer yes but this is not done through the deductions on schedule a. this can happen if the employer creates a flexible spending account fsa for its employees this can be created for certain approved uses like medical and transportation expenses a separate account for each category you can contribute amounts within certain limits to these accounts e.g. $ 255 a month for transportation with pre tax income deduct the contributions and then withdraw these funds to cover your transportation or medical expenses they work like a deductible ira except that these are spending and not retirement accounts basically the employer the role of ira fsa actually trustee and does the supporting paperwork

one common rule of thumb you can probably get 4 or better returns on your investments typical market rate of return is 8 to allow for inflation and off years figure out what kind of income you will want in retirement and divide by 0.04 to get the savings you need to accumulate to support that    this does n't allow for the fact that your needs are also going to increase with inflation you can make a guess at that and use an inflated needs estimate   not sophisticated   not precise but it 's a quick and dirty ballpark estimate and sometimes it 's surprisingly close to what a proper model would say

you would need to check with bank as it varies from bank to bank   you can break the fd 's generally you do n't loose the interest you have earned for 1 years however the rate of interest will be reduced i.e. if the rate was 7 for 1 year fd and 8 for 2 years fd when you break after a year you will get only 7 generally this can happen in few hours but definitely in 2 days you can get a loan against fd 's generally the rate of interest is 2 higher than fd rate there is also initial processing fee etc check with the bank it may take few days to set things up

as you alluded to in your question there is not one answer that will be true for all mutual funds   in fact i would argue the question is not specific to mutual funds but can be applied to almost anyone who must make an investment decision a mutual fund manager hedge fund manager or an individual investor even though money going into a company 401(k retirement savings plan is typically automatically allocated to different funds as we have specified this is generally not the case for other investment accounts for example i also have a roth ira in which i have some money from each paycheck direct deposited and it 's up to me to decide whether to leave that money in cash or to invest it somewhere else   every time you invest more money into a mutual fund the fund manager has the same decision to make there are two commonly used mutual fund figures that relate to your question turnover rate and cash reserves turnover rate measures the percent of a fund 's portfolio that changes every year   for example a turnover rate of 100 indicates that a fund replaces every asset it held at the beginning of the year with something else at the end of the year funds with turnover rates greater than 100 average a holding period for a given asset of less than one year and funds with turnover rates less than 100 average a holding period for a given asset of more than one year cash reserves simply measure the amount of money funds choose to keep as cash instead of investing in other assets another important distinction to make is between actively managed funds and passively managed funds passively managed funds are often referred to as index funds and have as their goal only to match the returns of a given index or some other benchmark   actively managed funds on the other hand try to beat the market by exploiting so called market inefficiencies e.g. buying undervalued assets selling overvalued assets timing the market etc to answer your question for a specific fund i would encourage you to look at the fund 's prospectus i take as one example of a passively managed fund the vanguard 500 index fund vfinx a mutual fund that was created to track the s&p 500   in its prospectus the fund states that to track its target index as closely as possible the fund attempts to remain fully invested in stocks furthermore the prospectus states that the fund 's daily cash balance may be invested in one or more vanguard funds which are very low cost money market funds   therefore we would expect both this fund 's turnover rate and cash reserves to be extremely low when we look at its portfolio composition we see this is true it is currently at a 4.8 turnover rate and holds in short term reserves   therefore we can assume this fund is regularly purchasing shares similar to a dollar cost averaging strategy instead of holding on to cash and purchasing shares together at a specific time for actively managed funds the picture will tend to look a little different   for example if we look at the fund 's portfolio composition we can see it has a turnover rate of 42 and holds around in cash short term reserves   in this case we can safely guess that trading activity may not be as regular as a passively managed fund as an active manager attempts to time the market   you may find mutual funds that have much higher cash reserves perhaps 10 or even more granted it is impossible to know the exact trading strategy of a mutual fund and for good reason if we knew for example that a fund purchases shares every day at in order to with the s&p 500 then sellers of s&p components could up the prices at that time to exploit the mutual fund 's trade strategy   large traders are constantly trying to find ways to conceal their actual trading activity in order to avoid these exact problems finally i feel obligated to note that it is important to keep in mind that trade frequency is linked to transactions costs in general the more frequently an investment manager whether it be you or a mutual fund manager executes trades the more that manager will lose in transactions costs

the simple answer might just be that the increased credit score you mentioned was enough to suddenly make you eligible for this lenders better rate so maybe that 's why you were n't able to get that low a rate before another option i can think of is that this particular bank offers these loans as a teaser rate to hopefully get more of your business later on it 's not exactly a loss leader i would think given the non existing deposit rates they 're probably still able to make money on the spread but they might be able to undercut other banks enough to get their into you figuratively speaking of course of course in order to evaluate if it 's worth switching to this deal you 'll also have to look at prepayment penalties and fees on your current loan these extra costs might be enough to make the switch

a few of the answers are spot on but here 's another thing to consider the type of trade for example i sometimes day trade stocks with momentum where the stock price is spiking relatively fast a limit order in this situation may never get filled and you will miss out on the trade a market order will get you filled but you mostly likely pay more than your limit order however you are now catching the wave up   overall using a limit or market is relative to your trading style and the type of trade i always prefer to use a limit buy order

just to comment on this i against the iraq war but i do understand why they went in and took the decisions they took even   afghanistan was a month after 911 there was strong public demand and support for it few protests   unfortunately that administration became obsessed with iraq and abandoned afghanistan to a skeleton force which had disastrous consequences for the country   but there was no specific intention in either case more a gross misread of the situation   there were intelligence failures they are n't infallible plus heavy political pressure on those agencies from a quite administration   the malaysian tribunal had no real legitimacy and was basically formed by a controversial pm who was quite anti western

not necessarily especially if your business model is founded on a free internet    take netflix in the short term they might make enough in tax breaks to pay for the fast lanes that isps want to charge but what happens when the isp decides to just bar netflix entirely because they are a competitor   they do n't even have to block them they could just intentionally throttle netflix to a degree where the service is unusable    so consumers are sitting there with crappy quality coming from netflix but that spectrum app is expanding and streams just swell    that 's where it is headed if net neutrality is killed if netflix does n't see this then they are blind and it is n't just netflix either it 's any service that competes with an isp 's other companies    in order for these tech companies to continue to enjoy success they need net neutrality or failing that a legal requirement that all isps can not have other businesses besides being an isp or true competition in all marketplaces for high speed internet

i wondered about this problem too so i looked into the maths and made this app it uses the free document format player if you try it out you can see what conditions favour renting vs buying   my own conclusion was to aim to buy a property outright upon reaching retirement age if not sooner example this example compares buying a £ 400,000 house with renting for £ 1,000 a month while depositing equivalent amounts in savings to total the same monthly outgoings as the buyer   mortgage rate deposit rate property appreciation and rent inflation can be specified   the example mortgage term is 20 years   as you can see the buyer and renter come out about even after the mortgage term but the buyer comes off better after that having no more mortgage to pay   of course the rent to live in a £ 400,000 house would probably be more than £ 1,000 but this case shows an equivalence point

hey just letting you know that i 've sort of felt the same as you before i 'm not 29 yet only a few years younger and i too am in alberta knowing that many trades can be quite lucrative here i too dipped my hand in them namely the hvac and plumbing trades and after a bit i felt that they were n't for me and this was after using a year looking for any ins during the recession since nobody was hiring first years during that whole year in the times i was n't looking for a job i was researching and looking up videos of the trades and was thinking how after some career counseling soul searching all that jazz i 'm about to head back to school next week if things go well by the time i graduate i will almost be 30 with my first and probably only degree     i would n't consider the years from the time i graduated high school to today where i think i 've figured out what i want to do a waste but instead i look at them as years where i grew as an adult and gaining real world experience in a few areas i 've in a future employer may look at them as wasted years but it is up to me to spin them in a positive way as my story just know that you are n't alone in this situation and i 'm sure there 's plenty of people worldwide in their 20 's and 30 's who are still trying to figure out what they want to do keep your head up and good luck

why would anyone listen to someone else 's advice because they believe that the person advising them knows better than they do it 's as simple as that   the fact that you 're doing any research at all indeed the fact that you know about a site on the internet where personal finance questions get asked and answered puts you way ahead of the average member of the population when it comes to pensions   if you think you know better than the adviser and i do n't mean that aggressively just as a matter of fact then by all means do your own thing but remember about unknown unknowns you do n't know everything the adviser might say depending on your circumstances and changes to them over time

if you are a permanent resident and it was n't taken away or abandoned then you are a resident alien for u.s. tax purposes one of the two tests for being a resident alien is the green card test being a resident alien means all your worldwide income is subject to u.s. taxes regardless of where you live or work that does n't necessarily mean you need to actually pay taxes on your income again if you 've already paid it you may be able to use the foreign tax credit to reduce your taxes by the amount already paid to a foreign government but you need to report it on u.s. tax forms just like income from the u.s. and you can then apply any tax credits that you may qualify for as a resident alien you file taxes using form 1040 you are required to file taxes if your income for a particular year is above a certain threshold this threshold is described in the first few pages of the 1040 instructions for each year for 2013 for single filing status under 65 it is $ 10000 the only way you can legally not file is if your income the whole year was below this amount you should go back and file taxes if you were required to but failed to having filed taxes when required is very important if you want to later on it is also one component of demonstrating you 're maintaining residency in the u.s. which you 're required to do as a permanent resident being outside the u.s. for a long time or else you 'll lose your permanent residency even filing taxes might not be enough as your description of your presence in the u.s. shows you only go there for brief periods each year not really living there you 're lucky you have n't lost your green card already any time you go there you run a great risk of them noticing and taking it away

but the flat would be occupied all the time famous last words are you prepared to have a tenant move in and stop paying rent in the us it can take 6 months to get a tenant out of the apartment and little chance of collecting back rent i do n't know how your laws work but here they do not favor the landlord   the tiny sub 1 profit you make while funding principal payments is a risky proposition it seems to me that even normal repairs heater appliances etc will put you to the negative   on the other hand if this property has bottomed in terms of price and it rises in value you may have a nice profit but if you are just renting it out it feels like it 's too close to call   by the way if you can go with a 30yr fixed i 'd suggest that this would get you to a better cash flow sooner a shorter mortgage simply means more money to principal each month   edit as far as equity goes at the beginning it seems the equity build up is really from your pocket definitely so by switching from the 30 to the 15 what is your goal the assumption i may have made is you wish to be a real estate investor with multiple properties doing so means saving up for the next down payment given the payoff time even if the property ran a high profit i imagine you 'd want to focus on cash flow minimize the monthly expense maximize what you can take each month to save for the next down payment it 's your choice years from now to have one paid property or 3 properties each with that 30 down payment and let time be your friend

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

you are very correct rebalancing is basically selling off winners to buy losers of course the thinking is that selling a winner that has already increased 100 on the basis that it has doubled so it is likely to go down in the near future however just look at apple as an example if you bought apple in june 2009 for $ 20 adjusted price and sold it as part of rebalancing when it rose to $ 40 adjusted price in september 2010 you would have missed out on it reaching over $ 95 2 years later similarly you look to rebalance by buying assets which have been say dropped by 50 on the basis that it has dropped so much that it should start increasing in the near future but many times the price can fall even further a better method would be to sell your winners when they stop being winners i.e. their uptrend ends and replace them with assets that are just starting their winning ways i.e. their downtrend has ended and are now starting to uptrend this can be achieved by looking at price action and referring to the definitions of an uptrend and a downtrend definition of an uptrend higher highs and higher lows definition of a downtrend lower lows and lower highs

when considering such a major life decision with such high potential costs and high potential rewards i encourage you to consider multiple different potential options even if loans were available they might not be the best option less debt and an engineering degree is better than more debt and an engineering degree both of which are likely better than your current debt and no engineering degree i encourage you to consider revisit your aid which is not just loans cut expenses consider alternative aid sources use your engineering student status to get a better paying job including more profitable summer employment check for methods to cut down the cost of your degree and double check your plans to make sure you have a long term plan that makes sense   the first issue raised in the comments is whether or not you are getting appropriate financial aid this does not just mean loans it includes grants and other forms of assistance   you should be getting in state tuition and by searching the tuition of unc i believe you are but for future readers you should make sure you are getting in state rates and it not there are options to return to a state where you would get in state tuition rates or look into the possibility of your study for one year until you meet in state funding requirements you should also ensure your fafsa information is correct including your income family situation whether or not you are an independent study as it sounds like you probably are etc this effects how many grants you get and if you are independent this changes maximum federal loan amounts see website for details   while you do n't say what your pay is the fact that you are working two jobs and having trouble making ends meet suggests either that you have a spending issue or that your jobs pay sucks and possibly both i 've been in both situations and there are methods for dealing with both if your spending is not very carefully controlled that 's a big issue i wo n't try to rehash all the personal finance advice about this but i will just warn that when you are desperate and you know there is n't enough money even if you spend perfectly there is a strong tendency to just give up and not even try because what 's the point learned is hell but it can be overcome with effort and tightly holding on to any of hope you find to do better each day if you are in a field like engineering or computing and some other fields though i am less personally familiar with the current employment climate in those there are usually companies who want to hire you as a paid intern or part time employee in the hopes of getting you when you graduate those last two semesters of undergrad are a technicality to employers they know it does n't really change your skill set much many companies are actually more interesting in hiring someone on who has n't finished the degree yet than getting someone recently post degree because they can get you cheaper and learn if this is a good match before they have to take the big risk of full time hiring you need to use this system to your advantage its hard when you feel destitute but talk with career councilors in your school your department advisor and/or main administrative staff in your main academic department make sure you are on the right mailing lists to see the job offers many schools require you to subscribe to one because at a school like unc it easily gets way too much traffic each day you need field relevant experience not just to finish the degree but to be able to really open up your job opportunities and earning potential do not be shy about directly calling emailing a contact who reaches out to your school looking for recent graduates and especially any mention of flexibility on early start for those who are almost finished you can say you are in your final year you are and even ask if they are open to working around a light school schedule while you finish up most can end up to be no but it does n't matter the recruiting contacts want to hire people so just reaching out early means you can follow up later once you get your degree and finances sorted out and you will have an even easier time getting that opportunity in technology and engineering the importance of summer internships can not be understated especially as you are now technically at the end of your degree in engineering and tech fields internships pay often very well do n't worry about it being the job of your dreams depending on your set of skills apply to insurance companies it departments in hospitals and banks even if you thought your coding skills in engineering were minimal and of course any paying position that might be more directly in your field of interest consider ones outside your immediate area or even the more national internships from the bigger name companies where possible it is not at all uncommon for tech and engineering internships for undergraduate students to pay $ + per hour even where most non degree jobs might only pay $ 8 and i 've seen as high as $ 40 per in the high cost of living markets depending on your skill set i know many people who were paid more as a student intern than they were previously paid as a full time professional employee many schools including unc charge different tuition for distance learning and satellite campuses and often also offer university approved online classes while this is not always a possibility for every student you should consider the options it could be that one of the final classes you need towards your degree can be taken at one of these other options with reduced tuition this is not always possible with all courses but is certainly true if you have any of those general education requirements to knock out also consider if any of those final requirements have test out options such as test alternatives again not always available but sometimes you can get class credit for a general education class for    finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money attend part time while working look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted inquire about scholarships and school emergency assistance while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options student loan forbearance while in school if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in skip a semester if necessary to save money if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet double check on credit expiration and degree requirements make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't inquire about other government and community based assistance being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you make sure your long term goal makes sense finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment at all   good luck on your journey and best wishes towards better days regardless of what path you choose   finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they

so betas are not found on a company 's financial statements beta is essentially a measure of the covariance of an asset and the overall market return in relation to the variance of the market 's return   a beta of 1 is to describe an asset whose daily returns mimic the returns of the overall market a beta of gt;1 describes an asset whose returns are greater than the market return and a beta describes an asset whose returns are less than the market return   to the extent that the asset you are comparing to the market index is a share of common stock the beta you are looking at is levered if the company has debt or preferred stock   the technique your professor is alluding to is the process of betas of two different companies that may have similar underlying operating assets but because of different capital structures have different betas when using their common stock returns this adjustment makes comparing different betas between companies agnostic of the capital structure used

just to add the 20 apr is the annualized interest rate but applied monthly so you 'd be charged $ 0.50 of interest on your $ 30 balance which gets capitalized on the next month so if you were to miss the next payment for some reason your new interest charge would be on $ instead of $ 30 actually it 'd be much more since there would be a fee for the late payment but discounting that to illustrate the point

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

points are significant levels technical analysts can use to determine directional movement support and resistance pivot points use the prior period 's high low and close to formulate future support and resistance in this regard pivot points are predictive or leading indicators there are at least five different versions of pivot points i will focus on standard pivot points here as they are the simplest if you are looking to trade off daily charts you would work out your pivot points from the prior month 's data for example pivot points for first trading day of february would be based on the high low and close for january they remain the same for the entire month of february new pivot points would then be calculated on the first trading day of march using the high low and close for february to work out the standard pivot points you use the high low and close from the previous period i.e. for daily charts it would be from the previous month in the following formulas you will now have 5 horizontal lines p r2 s1 and s2 which will set the general tone for price action over the next month a move above the pivot point p suggests strength with a target to the first resistance a break above first resistance shows even more strength with a target to the second resistance level r2 the converse is true on the downside a move below the pivot point p suggests weakness with a target to the first support level s1 a break below the first support level shows even more weakness with a target to the second support level s2 the second resistance and support levels r2 s2 can also be used to identify potentially overbought and oversold situations a move above the second resistance level r2 would show strength but it would also indicate an overbought situation that could give way to a similarly a move below the second support level s2 would show weakness but would also suggest a short term oversold condition that could give way to a bounce this could be used together with a momentum indicator such as rsi or stochastic to confirm overbought or oversold conditions   pivot points offer a methodology to determine price direction and then set support and resistance levels however it is important to confirm pivot point signals with other technical analysis indicators such as candle stick reversal patterns stochastic and general support and resistance levels in the price action these pivot points can be handy but i actually have n’t used them for trade setups and entries myself i prefer to use candle sticks together with stochastic to determine potential turning points and then take out trades based on these you can then use the pivot points resistance and support levels to help you estimate profit targets or areas to start becoming cautious and start tightening your stops say for example you have gone long from a signal you got a few days ago you are now in profit and the price is now approaching r2 whilst the stochastic is approaching overbought you might want to start tightening your stop loss as you might expect some weakness in the price in the near future if prices continue up you keep increasing your profits if prices do reverse then you keep the majority of your existing profits this would become part of your trade management if you are after finding potential market turning points and take out trades based on these then i would suggest using candlestick charting reversal patterns for your trade setups the patterns i like to use most in my trading can be described as either the hammer or one white soldier for bullish reversals and shooting star or one black for bearish reversals below are diagrams of where to place your entries and exits on both bullish and bearish reversal patterns bullish reversal pattern    so after some period of weakness in the price you would look for a bullish day where the price closes above the previous day ’s high you place your buy order here just before market close and place your initial stop just below the low of the day you would apply this either for an uptrending stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the support line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the oversold and crossing back upwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the down days and the market as a whole is moving up as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bullish move up at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves up you would move your stop loss to just below the low of each day alternative bullish reversal entry   an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop buy order to buy at the open of next trading day just above the high of the bullish green candle your stop is placed exactly the same just below the low of the green bullish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bullish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap up at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps up then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage bearish reversal pattern    so after some short period of strength in the price you would look for a bearish day where the price closes below the previous day ’s low you place your sell short order here just before market close and place your initial stop just above the high of the day you would apply this either for an stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the resistance line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the overbought and crossing back downwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the up days and the market as a whole is moving down as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bearish move down at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves down you would move your stop loss to just above the high of each day alternative bearish reversal entry    an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop sell short order to sell at the open of next trading day just below the low of the bearish red candle your stop is placed exactly the same just above the high of the red bearish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bearish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap down at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps down then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage you could also trade other candle stick patterns is similar ways and with the long entries you can also use them to get into the market with longer term trend following strategies you would usually just use a larger stop for longer term trading to determine the size of your order you would use the price difference between your entry and your stop you should not be risking more than 1 of your trading capital on any one trade so if your trading capital is $ 20,000 your risk per trade should be $ 200 if you were looking to place your buy at 5.00 and had your initial stop at $ you would divide $ 200 by $ 0.40 to get 500 stocks to buy using this form of money management you keep your losses down to a maximum of $ 200 some trades may be a bit higher due to some slippage which you should allow for in your trading plan which becomes your r multiple your aim is to have your average win at or higher 3 x your average loss which will give you a positive expectancy even with a win ratio under 50 once you have written down your trading rules you can search stock charts for potential setups when you find one you can backtest the chart for similar setup over the past few years for each setup in the past down the prices you would have entered at where you would have set your stop work out your r and go day by day moving your stop as you go and see where you would have been stopped out work out your profit or loss in terms of r for each setup and then add them up if you get a positive r multiple then this may be a good stock to trade on this setup if you get a negative r multiple then maybe give this stock a miss and look for the next setup you can setup watch lists of stocks that perform well for both long setups and short setups and then trade these stocks when you get a new signal it can take some time starting off but once you have got your watch lists for a particular setup you just need to keep monitoring those stocks you can create other watch lists for other type of setups you have backtested as well

benefit from lower interest rates because it decreases the rate at which they can borrow from the federal reserve from   but what matters is the spread if rates on the borrowing and lending side go down the spread shrinks which makes banks less profitable that 's why bank stocks go up when higher rates are anticipated you can think of a bank stock as being long interest rates   that 's why bank stocks have lagged the rest of the market during this long bull market   's assets are n't all debt   the vast majority is for most banks gs and ms are the rare exceptions

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

there are lots of good points here already but something that has n't been mentioned yet is what would happen if the purchased items break or are somehow defective depending on the warranty and how trustworthy the company is there could be an advantage to not having fully paid for the item yet when a defect is discovered as it might incentivize the company to be more attentive to your warranty claim since they are faced with knowing that you could stop making payments if they do n't act in a timely manner note i 'm not suggesting you stop making payments in this case just that companies and banks are oftentimes more willing to work with you when you owe them money

building out infrastructure is time consuming and labor intensive you also have no guarantee that because you put fiber to every house in a neighborhood that every person will sign up for your service building out infrastructure requires permits from the municipality and underground wiring on new poles on existing poles etc it requires tying into existing networks more infrastructure permitting and commercial contracts   if you want to offer telephone services that requires more network and permitting and has additional requirements as phone service has legacy legal requirements if you want to offer tv services you need more infrastructure and commercial contracts with the tv channels   in many municipalities existing providers ie comcast twc have exclusive contracts with the city that say no one else can come in and build a network   tldr legal contracts commercial contracts and the expense of building out the actual infrastructure make it pretty much impossible to create your own isp unless you have regular money like google does

yes the distinction between how your funds are applied to principal vs interest is very important the interest amount charged each period probably monthly is not just one fixed sum calculated at the origination but rather is a dynamically calculated amount that changes each period relative to how much principal is remaining amount you owe   the picture you posted showing principal and interest assumes the payer always paid their minimum payment and never made any extra payments of principal take a look at the following graph and play around with the extra payment fields you will see some pretty drastic differences in the total interest paid green lines when extra payments are made

it 's not usually a good idea to buy a house as an investment buy a house because you want the house not for an investment your money will make more money invested somewhere other than a house additionally based on talking about renting rooms to pay the mortgage and the gi bill i assume you are planning on going to school and not working i am not that familiar with va loans but i imagine they will require you show some form of income before they are willing to give you a loan 14 returns over the long run are very good but last year the market was up almost 30 if you were only at 14 for last year you left quite a bit on the table i would advise against   individual stocks for investments except as a hobby put the majority of your investments into low fee mutual funds and keep a smaller amount that you can afford to lose in stocks

since these indices only try to follow vix and do n't have the underlying constituents as the constituents do n't really exist in most meaningful senses they will always deviate from the exact numbers but should follow the general pattern you 're right however in stating that the graphs that you have presented are substantially different and look like the indices other than vix are always decreasing the problem with this analysis is that the basis of your graphs is different they all start at different dates we can fix this by putting them all on the same graph   this shows that the funds did broadly follow vix over the period 5 years and this also encompasses a time when some of the funds started the funds do decline faster than vix from the beginning of 2012 onward and i had a theory for why so i grabbed a graph for that period my theory was that since volatility had fallen massively after the of the financial crisis there was less money to be made from betting on investing in volatility and so the assets invested in the funds had fallen making them smaller in comparison to their 2011 2012 basis   here we see that the funds are again closely following vix until the beginning of 2016 where they again lower as volatility fell probably again as a result of withdrawals of capital as vix returns fell a tighter graph may show this again as the gap seems to be narrowing as people look to bet on volatility due to recent events so if the funds are basically following vix why has vix been falling consistently over this time increased certainty in the markets and a return to growth or at least lower negative growth in most economies particularly western economies where the majority of market investment occurs and a reduction in the risk of european countries defaulting particularly portugal ireland greece and spain the pigs countries has resulted in lower volatility and a return to market conditions in summary the funds are basically following vix but their values are based on their underlying capital this underlying capital has been falling as returns on volatility have been falling resulting in their diverging from vix whilst broadly following it on the new basis

in a word budgeting in order to have money left over at the end of the month you need to be intentional about how you spend it that is all a budget is a plan for spending your money   few people have the discipline and abundance of income necessary to just wing it and not overspend by making a plan at home ahead of time you can decide how much you will spend on food entertainment etc and ensure you have enough money left over for things like rent mortgage and utility bills and still have enough for longer term savings goals like a car purchase or retirement   if you do n't have a plan it 's simply not reasonable to expect yourself to know if you have enough money for a cup as you drive past the starbucks a good plan will allow you to spend on things that are important to you while ensuring that you have enough to meet your obligations and long term goals   another thing a budget will do for you is highlight where your problem is if your problem is that you are spending too much money on luxuries the budget will show you that it might also reveal to you that your rent is too high or your energy consumption is too great on the other hand you might realize after budgeting that your spending is reasonable but your income is too low in that case you should focus on spending more of your time working or looking for a better paying job

speaking from stock market point of view ta is similarly applicable to day trading short term medium term and long term you may use different indicators in fx compared to the stock market but i would expect they are largely the same types of things direction indicators momentum indicators spread indicators divergence indicators the key thing with ta or even when trading anything is that when you have developed a system that you back test it to prove that it will work in bear bull and stagnant markets i have simple systems that are fine in strong bull markets but really poor in stagnant markets also have a trading plan know when you are going to exit and enter your trades what criteria and what position size understand how much you are risking on each trade and actively manage your risk i urge caution over your statement one weakened by parting the political union but ought to bounce back we my uk based it business have already lost two potential clients due to brexit these companies are in and have no idea of what is going to happen so i would respectfully suggest that you may have less knowledge than professionals who deal in currency and property but one premise of ta is that you let the chart tell you what is happening in any case trade well and with a plan

it basically only affects the company 's dealings with its own stock not with operational concerns   if the company were to offer more stock for sale it would get less cash   if it had a stock buy back program it could buy more shares for the same money   if it was to offer to acquire another company in exchange for its own stock the terms would be less attractive to the other company 's owners   employee stock remuneration stock options and so forth would be affected so there might be considerations and tax consequences for the company

i was active in prosper when it started up it was very easy to get attracted to the high risk loans with big interest rates and i lost about 14 after all my loans ran their course there 's 10 still active but it wo n't change the figure by much prosper has wider standards than lending club so more borrowers with worse credit scores could ask for loans lenders could also set interest rates far lower so they could end up having loans with rates lower than the risk implied   this was set up with the idea of a free market where anyone could ask to borrow and anyone could loan money at whatever interest rate they wanted   it turns out a lot of lenders were not as smart as they thought they were aside it 's funny how people will for a free market but when they lose money will suddenly be against the free market they said they wanted this seems to apply to both individual p2p lenders up to massive multinational banks   since then prosper has tightened their standards on who can borrow and the interest rates are now fixed so i expect going forward it will be less easy to lose a bunch of money   the key is that one bad loan will erase the return of many good ones so it 's best to examine the loans carefully and stick with the high quality   simplified example if you have 10 1 yr loans of $ 100 each paying 10 interest year you get 10 return at the end of the year so $ 100 10 of $ 1000 but if one loan goes bad at the start you have lost money so a 90 success rate in picking borrowers leads to a loss you want to diversity over quite a few loans and you want to fund quality loans   i think really enjoyed investing through prosper because it gave me an insight into lending and loss ratios that i had not had before it also caused me to look at the banks with even more when the case of the no doc loans and am loans came to light

putting chris 's comment as an answer it 's your income not your spouse 's income you can give her the money but you 'll still be paying tax on it to elaborate more the general principle of income taxation is that income is taxed when received and specific expenditures can be deducted if you giving the money to your spouse is not one of this specific deductibles then it is not deductible your income nevertheless is still taxed to you as you 're the one to receive it

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

if the investments are in a non retirement taxable account there 's not much you can do to avoid short term capital gains if you sell now ways to limit short term capital gains taxes donate you can donate some of the stock to charity before selling it transfer you can give some of the stock to say a family member in a lower tax bracket but there are tons of rules gift limits and wo n't work for little kids or full time students they would still pay taxes at their own rate protect your gains by buying puts wait it out until the long term capital gains rate kicks in this allows you to lock in your gains now but you wo n't benefit from potential future appreciation buying puts also costs $ so do the roi calculation you could also sell a call and buy a put at the same time and lock in your gains for certain but the irs often looks at that as locking in the short term capital gain so be careful and talk to a tax professional if you are considering that method die there 's a step up basis on capital gains for estates source

this does n't sound very legal to me real estate losses can not generally be deducted unless you have other real estate income so the only case when this would work is when that person has bunch of other buildings that do produce income and he reduces that income for tax purposes by deducting the expenses depreciation taxes for the buildings that do not however depreciation does n't really reduce taxes only defers them to the sale as mhoran_psprep said all the rest of the expenses will be minimal

place your savings into safe interest bearing accounts take out the loans   keep constant track of your net worth having 100,000 $ and 80,000 $ in interest free debt is better than having   you can always convert money + debt into less money and less debt but you can not always convert less money and less debt into more money and more debt now there are risks that is why you want an interest bearing account to place your savings in to offset the debt   this minimizes the risk   it also reduces the return it is arguable that you should be at your most financially risky at a young age   i 'd argue that your future earnings are your by far largest asset at this point and as a high school student going into college those future earnings have extremely high variability your financial situation is extremely unpredictable being conservative about your high leverage student loan + education investments is probably justified   the fact you can manage arbitrage here means you should and if you are careful you can eliminate risk and get almost risk free profit from the maneuver if your money is in less than perfectly safe accounts you are now doing leveraged investing and magnifying the risk and return of said investments if your money must be spent on college or you 'll be financially punished then you may want to consider pulling it out before the last possible legal point just in case something goes wrong apparently 529 plans may not treat paying off student loans as a valid way to spend the money   you may need to talk to a lawyer or accountant about the legality of using these plans to pay off student loans and the tax penalties involved

if you have a public company and shareholder a owns 25 and shareholder b owns 25 and lets say the remaining 50 is owned by various funds small investors    say profits are and a dividend is payed say 50 mil worth is payed out as dividend and 30 mil is kept as retained earnings for future investment can the remaining 20 mil be distributed to shareholders a and b so that they both get each can certain shareholders be favored and get a bigger cut of profits than the dividends pay out is my question basically

i 'm not asking if i should carry a balance to the end of the billing period and accrue interest typically i say typically because there may be some fringe outlier exception product that begins accruing interest immediately if you 're not carrying a balance already you will not be charged interest for carrying a balance during the billing period    you accrue a balance you 're issued a statement if you pay the statement before the due date indicated you do n't pay interest even if your statement balance is less than the current actual balance on the account   if you carry a balance through that due date you begin to accrue interest   not only on the balance carried but on all new charges as well   but as long as you consistently pay your statement balance before the statement due date you will not be charged any interest as for a reason why you may want to take advantage of this simply to ease the administration of your finances   you just do n't need to touch the accounts that frequently to avoid interest charges   sure you can let your money sit in an interest bearing account and earn a couple dollars a year but really you just do n't need to focus on your cc charges this frequently

looking at your numbers i would definitively consider selling the car and use the public transportation instead you could easily save $ 450 month plus gas and maintenance as you mentioned public transportation will be only a fraction of this amount so you might end up saving around $ 400 monthly if you decide to keep the car the amount that you will spent monthly is easily a payment for a brand new car what if god forbid for any kind of reason you get a traffic ticket that can increase your insurance premium what if the engine stops working and you will need to spent thousands of dollars fixing the car with this and all of the other expenses up you might be unable to afford all this at some point if you decide to sell the car the money that you will save monthly can be put in a savings account or in any other sort of safe investment instrument in this way if your situation changes where you need a car again you will be able to easily afford a new car regarding your need to visit your friends on the suburbs every other weekend i think you can just talk with them and meet on places where public transportation is available or ask them to pick you up in the nearest station to the suburbs   in conclusion based on what you said i do not think the little convenience that you get in owning the car outweighs the big savings that you get monthly if you decide to sell the car

i had about $ 16k in student loans i defaulted on the loans and they got   > passed to a collection type agency   these guys are as legitimate as a collection agency can be one thing that i feel is very sketchy is when they were verifying my identity they said does your social security number end in is your birthday month day year   that is not sketchy it would be sketchy for a caller to ask you to give that information that 's a common scheme for identity theft are following the rules on this one my mom suggested i should consider applying for bankruptcy wo n't help student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy you have the bankruptcy reform act passed during the bush 43 regime for that the loan itself is from school what school contact them and ask for help they may have washed their hands of your case when they turned over your file to then again they may not it 's worth finding out    also name and shame the school future applicants should be warned that they will do this   what can i do to aid in my negotiations with this company do n't negotiate on the phone you 've discovered that they wo n't honor such negotiations ask for written communications sent by postal mail keep copies of everything including both sides of the canceled checks you use to make payments during the six months and in the future keep making the payments you agreed to in the conversation six months ago do not ever ignore a letter from them do not ever skip going to court if they send you a summons to appear they count on people doing this they can get a default judgement if you do n't show up then you 're well and truly screwed what do you want you want the $ 4 k fee removed if you want something else figure out   what it is here 's what to do write them a polite letter explaining what you said here the conversation you had with their telephone agent where they said they would remove the $ 4 k fee if you made payments   the later conversation if possible give the dates of both conversations and the names of the both agents    explain the situation completely do n't assume the recipient of your letter knows anything about your case include evidence that you made payments as agreed during the six months if you were late or something do n't withhold that   ask them to remove the extra $ 4 k from your account and ask for whatever else you want send the letter to them with a return receipt requested or even registered mail that will prevent them from claiming they did n't get it and it will show them you 're serious write a cover letter admitting your default saying you relied on their negotiation to set things straight and saying you 're they are n't sticking to their word the cover letter should ask for help sorting this out send copies of the letter with the cover letter to be sure to mark your letter to cc all these folks so they know you are asking for help it ca n't hurt to call your congressional representative 's office and ask to whom you should send the letter and then address it by name this is called constituent service and they take pride in it if you send this letter with copies you 're letting them know you intend to fight   the collection agency may decide it 's not worth the fight to get the $ 4 k and decide to let it go    again if they call to pressure you say you 'd rather communicate in writing and that they are not to call you by telephone then hang up   should i hire a lawyer   yes but only if you get a court summons or if you do n't get anywhere with this you can give the lawyer all this paperwork i 've suggested here and it will help her come up to speed on your case this is the kind of stuff the lawyer would do for you at well over $ 100 per hour is bankruptcy really an option certainly not unfortunately never forget that student lenders and their collection agencies are dangerous and clever predators you are their lawful prey they look at you lick their chops and think food watch john oliver 's of that industry   good luck and stay safe

there 's no reason for the employer not to deduct the whole amount before you leave the fsa salary deduction has to be periodical but it does n't have to be calculated over a year it just means that an equal amount will be deducted from your every paycheck and if the employer and you know that your last paycheck is on june 30th even before the year starts there 's nothing to stop the employer from calculating the periodic payments so that it will cover your full fsa amount before you leave that is of course other than mere convenience it may be easier cheaper to just give you the extra $ than to deal with the special case deduction calculation this is different from unexpected termination resignation where the employer could n't have made such an assumption and thus the periodic payments were calculated over a year see pub 969 the selection is annual the deductions are periodical

yes as long as you write a call against your stock with a strike price greater than or equal to the previous day 's closing price with 30 or more days till there will be no effect on the holding period of your stock like you mentioned unqualified covered calls suspend the holding period of your stock   for example you sell a deep in the money call sometimes called the last write on a stock you have held for 5 years the covered call is classified as unqualified the holding period is and the gain or loss on the stock will be treated as short term selling out of the money calls or trading in an ira account keeps things simple the details below have been summarized from an article i found at   the article also talks about the implications of rolling a call forward and tax situations where it may be advantageous to write unqualified covered calls basically when you have a large deferred long term loss two criterion must be met for a covered call to be considered a qualified covered call 1 days to expiration must be greater than 30 2 strike price must be greater than or equal to the first available in the money strike price below the previous day 's closing price for a particular stock   additionally if the previous day 's closing price is $ 25 or less the strike price of the call being sold must be greater than 85 of yesterday 's closing price 2a if the previous day 's closing price is greater than and less than or equal to $ 150 days to is between 60 90 as long as the strike price of the call is greater than 85 of the previous days close and less than 10 points in the money you can write a covered call two strikes in the money 2c if the previous day 's closing price is greater than $ 150 and days till expiration is greater than 90 you can write a covered call two strikes in the money

it 's probably important to understand what a credit score is    a credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back   it is supplemented by your age time at current residence time at previous residences time at your job etc a person with zero debt history can still have a decent score provided they are well established a little older and have a good job   the top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an appropriate amount of debt and are well established   in other words you 're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community   after all creditors do n't normally like being the first one you try out being young and having recently moved you are basically a flight risk   meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much so you have a couple options   the first is to simply wait   keep going to work keep living where you are etc   as you establish yourself you become less of a risk    the second is to start incurring debt   personally i am not a fan of this one   some people do well by getting a small credit card using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately   others do n't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before if i were in your position i 'd likely do one of two things   either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan or take the cheaper phone for a couple years

it is very difficult in new york city to evict a tenant the tenant landlord laws require that the tenant be taken to housing court the time between filing a case for eviction and having the case heard is often five to six months during this time the tenant is allowed to live in the rental property note that this situation is independent of any rent stabilization or rent control aspects of the lease if either of those issues are involved there may be additional complications i know that this is true based on first hand experience i was the in my apartment and rented out the extra room to a woman who worked with me even though we did not have a formal lease agreement i was still considered her landlord i consulted with a real estate attorney in manhattan who told me that the situation was no different whether i was a property owner and rented to tenants or whether it was a roommate situation such as what i was doing regardless the entire process of filing and having a hearing in housing court was necessary for eviction in florida as else where laws vary by county or even at a more local level i know that the landlord files a notice and arranges for the 's office to remove the tenant procedures and law in miami county need to be checked on the official county website

i am also confused by what he says the djia has not been at 900 for decades however a $ 36 dividend is 4 per unit if you get $ 9 per unit per quarter 2/3 of 4 is that is inside his 7.5 to 5.5 how much you have in dividend paying stocks vs. bonds most often is a function of your age for example i have heard the advice of subtracting your age in years from 110 and that would be the percent you hold in dividend paying stocks at age 30 you would have 80 in stocks at age 60 you would be 50 in stocks there are retirement funds that do this for you   but the bottom line all depends on your risk tolerance i have a large tolerance for risk so even though i am currently retired i only have 10 of my money in a safe investment ticker = pgf it pays 5.5 per year   the rest is in a leveraged junk bond fund that pays 15.5 per year

retirement accounts often can be invested with pretax money with the exception of roth accounts that use post tax and have tax free growth if you follow the rules rather than after tax money as well as provide a shelter so that you are n't having to pay annual taxes on dividends and other possible distributions another point would be to consider how much money you 'd be investing as some funds may have institutional versions that can be much cheaper than others e.g. compare vanguard 's index funds that the 500 index in investor shares admiral shares and institutional forms where the tickers would be vfinx vfiax viiix to consider some companies may have access to the institutional funds that are n't what you 'd have unless you are investing millions of dollars upfront lastly if there is n't an employer plan and you make a ton of cash you may not qualify for a deductible ira or roth ira contribution for something else that may happen if you want to start playing with what if

an important point yet to be mentioned is that with a standard investment the most you can lose of your £ 100 stake is £ 100 if the company literally goes bust say with shorting on the other hand your downside is not limited to your initial stake   you could invest £ 100 but end up owing £ 200 £ 500 or well the sky 's the limit shorting is dangerous even for experienced investors   for a beginner it is about the worst possible investment strategy i can think of

note that we do not comment on specific stocks here and have no place doing so if your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic i have not tried to answer that part below the key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a company 's cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the company 's cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits losses etc are priced into the stock price since future cash flows profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in the price of a stock should n't move at all on an earnings statement this begs the question why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings the models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and can not take into account everything an unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows this goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses this means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value in the end if people 's expectation of the company 's performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement if the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement

if someone gains access to these data he could use social engineering approach to you i.e. call the american express and ask tell he he is you and he lost the access to the account and he needs the access to be reset and sent to certain email and if they doubt it 's you he would send them the statement data even on company letterhead which he would be able to fake since he has the data from the statements and ae has no idea how the authentic letterhead looks like he could also do the opposite trick like calling your assistant or even yourself and saying something like i 'm from american express calling about the transaction at this and this date and this and this time this amount please confirm you are your name and your address is your address i need to confirm something which would make it appear as he is really from ae since he knows all these details and then ask you some detail he 's missing for security like your birth date or last digits of or anything like that and then use these details to you to ae   so putting all this info together where it can be accessed by strangers does have risks it may not work out if both you and ae personnel are vigilant and follow instructions to the letter but we know it not always so

the papers you would need to buy are called futures and they give you the right to buy or sell a certain amount of oil at a certain location some large harbor typically for a certain price on a certain day you can typically sell these futures anytime if you find someone that buys them and depending on the direction you bought you will make or lose money according to oil rice changes if you have the future to get oil for 50 $ and the market price is 60 this paper is obviously worth 10 $ note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it which might not be very useful to you as most traders do n't want really any oil that might happen automatically or by default but you need to make sure of that note also that worst case you could lose a lot more money than you put in if you buy a future to deliver oil for 50 $ and the oil price runs you will have to procure the oil for new price meaning pay the current price for it there is no theoretical limit so depending on what you trade you could lose ten times or a thousand times what you invested i worded that without technical lingo so it is clear for beginners this is the concept not the full technical explanation

voluntarily assuming a loan is a bad idea especially for a non investment purpose it would be one thing to take on a loan to operate a business or buy a piece of capital equipment like a machine that would make you money borrowing money to have a more luxurious house is foolish the smart move is to buy a good quality home that will meet your needs for as little as possible having $ 800,000 leaves a quit a bit of leeway in that department you do n't say where you live but if this occurred in my area eastern massachusetts i would buy a house for $ 500,000 and then invest the remaining $ 300,000 if i lived in the california bay area it might be necessary to spend the whole $ 800,000 either way there should be no need to borrow money also if you buy a house for cash often you can get a substantially better deal than if you have to involve a bank not owing anyone money is a huge psychological advantage in business and in life in general view being debt free as a to success and happiness

robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the vix index for two reasons   1 the vix index is for s&p500 options only if you are trading other options it is less useful 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the vix index   so please look at the right implied volatility   in terms of strategy i do n't think that not doing anything is a good strategy i accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view   so you are long 1 call suppose strike 10 suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money now it 's 9   1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10 this way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations   2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9 this way you end up with a bear call spread again you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9 this way you end up with a call butterfly you are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional at that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional   these are just some opportunities you have there is no reason for you to wait options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk   it 's true that buying a call does n't make you loose more than the premium you paid but it 's better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment is n't it   hope that helps

you are entirely correct that it is an assumption so i will not argue the point any further other than to say that i do n't think it 's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin economy and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility it seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices ca n't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal it 's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a over typical government backed fiat currencies when we utilize this advantage real people will use the technology and a genuine economy could flourish    as a caveat to this i 'm not 100 convinced that bitcoins are the answer to me bitcoins are one particular brand of free as in speech decentralized crypto currencies when i speak of bitcoins i 'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation although i do believe the exact software you can download and run at this moment have the potential for tremendously more use than they 're currently being used for

i ca n't find the underlying legislation but a few online resources suggest that if you contact a lender about a payment plan they should put repayments on hold temporarily we do n’t think it ’s fair if your lender does n’t help you    get on top of things if you ask for help or breathing space to sort    things out if you 've had problems repaying the loan you can complain if your payday lender did not offer to freeze interest and charges if you are able to make payments under a reasonable repayment plan by law they must suspend recovery of the debt for a reasonable period if you ’re developing a repayment plan with a debt adviser or on your own i 'd start by making an immediate complaint to the lender make them aware that you 're unable to meet basic living expenses because of the money they took and ask for them to suspend collection temporarily and for the money to be returned i would also dispute the charge with your bank on the grounds that it should not have been taken given the circumstances and ask for them to credit your account while they investigate the dispute they may not be too keen given it 'll leave you overdrawn if they later reject the dispute but it 's worth asking in parallel with that contact citizens advice and/or the financial ombudsman details in the links and see if there 's anything they can do or suggest

one interesting part of this history that is often forgotten was how absolutely close we came to a universal basic income under nixon fap went through the democratic dominated house without much trouble in late 1970 it carried a very decisive margin absent a of rather unique circumstances in 1970 high among them the cambodian campaign for a host of reasons that created a chill between nixon and the senate from which their relations would never truly recover it is not at all hard to imagine it being passed    one wonders how welfare policy would have developed with that keep in mind fap was meant to help both the working poor and working class as well as really more than the underclass which was part of how knew how to appeal to nixon    other factors in fap 's downfall include   1 the of the finance committees these things often were passed down by generation by strongly conservative southern democrats whose states being largely still the poorest the new south was only getting started would have disproportionately effected by fap largely against their own political interests unlike the great society fap would have given recipients direct cash payouts and would have largely gone over their heads so to speak and after the cambodian campaign nixon could ill afford to alienate them    2 nixon 's shift in attention in the summer of 1970 to other areas prominent among them national security and foreign policy for the former the violently illegal to the point where j. edgar hoover no shrinking when it came to treating the civil rights of certain us citizens with some flexibility objected plan would be created in the summer of 70 as for the latter this was when the china initiative was just beginning to take off and getting into high gear following the destruction of the absent both of these nixon would have his hands full at any rate that autumn with the dual crisis of the black september and right at the moment fap was in its death in front of the aforementioned finance committees   nixon would take a subsequent conservative turn for the 1970 elections following a very strategy with little to no success which shaped his 1972 strategy    3 the strong resistance of the senate gop to the measure especially in the wake of the great society some libertarians did support the fap but intended it to replace the welfare state as opposed to nixon wishing to supplement it it into something more fiscally feasible the gop were strongly resistant in general to nixon 's attempts to transform the gop into something they fundamentally did n't wish to be    the ultimate of this was had nixon had his way his vp and eventual successor would have been john former texas governor and 's de facto right hand man top fixer who the kind of conservative democrat that nixon wanted to transform the gop with into what would have essentially been a style party this was not the same vision the people who dominated the gop at the local level had in mind to say the least and was a contributing factor into why nixon did n't invest a lot of energy into for the gop during the 72 and why the party returned the favor during    4 the resistance of a lot of senate liberals to anything that would have given nixon a domestic success especially after cambodia and before the 70 merely the clinton wars in reverse in a sense clinton 's strategy in 1995 after the democratic slaughter in the of 1994 was ironically off of nixon 's in 1971 following the disappointing results of the 1970 for the gop   the fap would be attempted again twice but it never really had the same chance of passing that it did the first time as for cheney and i 'm not terribly shocked both of them belong to the heavily influenced wing of the party that historically has n't had much attachment to small government style thinking found in the congressional part of the gop they both have a knack for thinking politically too cheney defended bush senior 's decision to not boot the out of in the early 90s when few in the gop were the next decade would dramatically change things as the dominant foreign policy ideology of the part transformed to the ideology of democratic that came over to the basement in the reagan years and in 92 against bush the who along with the old style nixon realist foreign policy school of the party cheney knew where his bread was and where the winds were going   was also a dove on vietnam by 71 believe it or not to the point where it somewhat alienated nixon and eventually incurred the of hr a very unwise move in the nixon white house to the point where he got kicked upstairs to a post in brussels dealing with nato the reason i emphasized normally is because this let escape completely unscathed had that not happened there 's no way he 'd have had the clout to pull off the halloween in 75 at that age

you are expecting that if you pay off a 30 mortgage after 16 years you should be charged the same amount of interest as someone who had a 16 year mortgage for the same amount and with the same interest rate this is n't correct and here 's why the person with the 16 year mortgage paid it off faster than you they paid more each month and the size of their loan shrunk faster than yours after 15 years they had paid off a lot more than you you paid a lump sum after 16 years but at this point the extra money which they had paid had been in the banks hands for a long time you caught up with them then but you had been behind them for all of the previous years on the other hand you owed the same amount in each of those years as the person who took out a 30 year mortgage and did n't prepay therefore you paid the same amount of interest as this person not the first person if you could arrange in advance a loan where you made the same payment as you did for 16 years then paid the balance in a lump sum then you would have paid exactly what you did

congratulations on a solid start here are my thoughts based on your situation asset classes i would recommend against a long term savings account as an investment vehicle while very safe the yields will almost always be well below inflation since you have a long time horizon most likely at least 30 years to retirement you have enough time to take on more risk as long as it 's not more than you can live with if you are looking for safer alternatives to stocks for part of your investments you can also consider investment grade bonds bond funds or even a stable value fund later when you are much closer to retirement you may also want to consider an annuity depending on the interest rate on your loan you may also be able to get a better return from paying down your loan than from putting more in a savings account i would recommend that you only keep in a savings account what you expect to need in the next few years cushion for regular expenses emergency fund etc on stocks stocks are riskier but have the best chance to outperform versus inflation over the long term i tend to favor funds over individual stocks mostly for a few practical reasons first one of the goals of investing is to diversify your risk which produces a more efficient risk reward ratio than a group of stocks that are highly correlated diversification is easier to achieve via an index fund but it is possible for a well educated investor to stay diversified via individual stocks also since most investors do n't actually want to take physical possession of their shares funds will manage the shares for you as well as offering additional services such as the automatic of dividends and tax management asset allocation it 's very important that you are comfortable with the amount of risk you take on investment salespeople will prefer to sell you stocks as they make more commission on stocks than bonds or other investments but unless you 're able to stay in the market for the long term it 's unlikely you 'll be able to get the market return over the long term make sure to take one or more risk tolerance assessments to understand how often you 're willing to accept significant losses as well as what the optimal asset allocation is for you given the level of risk you can live with generally speaking for someone with a long investment horizon and a medium risk tolerance even the most conservative allocations will have at least 60 in stocks total of us and international with the rest in bonds other and up to 80 or even 100 for a more aggressive investor owning more bonds will result in a lower expected return but will also dramatically reduce your portfolio 's risk and volatility pension with so many companies deciding that they do n't feel like keeping the promises they made to yesterday 's workers or simply ca n't afford to the pension is nice but like social security i would n't bank on all of this money being there for you in the future this is where a fee only financial planner can really be helpful they can run a bunch of scenarios in planning software that will show you different retirement scenarios based on a variety of assumptions ie what if you only get 60 of the promised pension etc   this is probably not as much of an issue if you are an equity partner or if the company fully funds the pension in a segregated account or if the pension is defined contribution but most corporate pensions are just a general promise to pay you later in the future with no real money actually set aside for that purpose so i 'd discount this in my planning somewhat fund stock selection generally speaking most investment literature agrees that you 're most likely to get the best risk adjusted returns over the long term by owning the entire market rather than betting on individual winners and losers since no one can predict the future including professional money managers as such i 'd recommend owning a low cost index fund over holding specific sectors or specific companies only remember that even if one sector is more profitable than another the stock prices already tend to reflect this concentration in it consultancy i am concerned that one third of your investable assets are currently in one company the it consultancy it 's very possible that you are right that it will continue to do well that is not my concern my concern is the risk you 're carrying that things will not go well again you are taking on risks not just over the next few years but over the next 30 or so years until you retire and even if it seems unlikely that this company will experience a downturn in the next few years it 's very possible that could change over a longer period of time please just be aware that there is a risk one way to mitigate that risk would be to work with an advisor or a fund to structure and investment plan where you invest in a variety of sector funds except for technology that way your overall portfolio including the single company will be closer to the market as a whole rather than over weighted in it tech however if this it consultancy happens to be the company that you work for i would strongly recommend yourself of those shares as soon as reasonably possible in my opinion the risk of having your salary pension and much of your investments tied up in the fortunes of one company would simply be a much larger risk than i 'd be comfortable with last make sure to keep learning so that you are making decisions that you 're comfortable with with the amount of savings you have most investment firms will consider you a high net worth client so make sure you are making decisions that are in your best financial interests not theirs again this is where a fee only financial advisor may be helpful you can find a local advisor at best of luck with your decisions

i have an idea let 's make home loans for people who traditionally would n't have been able to afford them package them up into large packages of many loans then sell as a super safe investment a portion of that package designed to absorb the least of the default risk   the big investors will have a safe place to put their money people will get houses they could n't otherwise afford and we 'll get management fees from the former and high returns from the latter paying back their high interest mortgages satisfying the more risky portion of the mortgage package that we 're not selling assuming not too many of them default but that 's unlikely given that the housing market can only go up from here everyone wins

a letter of credit is commonly used by importers who want to ensure that their product is shipped before paying the exporter the exporter has a guarantee that the payment for the goods will be received once the shipment has been made   it is used to resolve a game theory type situation for example you are buying a car from china for $ 40,000 usd the exporter of the car asks for the money before he will ship the car but if you give him the money then he has no incentive aside from legal pressures to ship the car instead you sign a letter of credit for the transaction which basically sends your payment to the exporters bank but puts a hold on it until the exporter proves that he has shipped the car and proved that he has insured the shipment against damages

one of the main advantages is that duplication from a few sources is no longer a vector   the two big examples the lesser first card skimming and breaches like target 's   the chip essentially generates a unique transaction code and that is generated inside the chip   so even if you installed a chip you 'd have to beat the merchant to using the code and it would only be good once   the same is true if you get something like the target breach   instead of a giant dump of card numbers you get a giant dump of used codes which are n't very useful for getting money   even if the risk of stolen cards goes up it should be a huge advantage for the banks    additionally a number of the banks are now implementing quick and short term freezes like the discover it card app   you simply click freeze in the app if you are n't sure where your card is and unfreeze it when you do   the assumption here is that people are more likely to freeze it and do so sooner than if they have to wait for a new card in the mail   theoretically there 's nothing stopping a consumer from keeping the card frozen all the time and it when they walk into a store except the of it

you will owe tax on all but the deposit that was not taxed   e.g. you deposited $ for 3 years and deducted $ 5 k for each of 2 years the third $ 5 k   deposit was a nondeductible ira contribution which you reported to the irs by filing form 8606 with your tax return for that year now you convert the total balance of $ 18 k $ 15 k of contributions plus $ 3 k of interest gains in this case $ 5 k is not taxable income while the $ 13 k is taxable income this calculation is done on form 8606 for the year of the rollover edit in response to op 's comment the roth conversion is text based on the value of a day it was   converted one thing to be aware of is that you can re characterize up until the time you file your taxes for 2017 in april 2018 or with extension up until october   this offers you the opportunity to undo the conversion if for whatever reason the value is lower at the time you do your taxes or if the converted amount will put you into a higher tax bracket you do n't need to give the irs a reason it 's up to your discretion as dave note in a comment the conversion is n't all or none the recharacterization along with this fact help you to fine tune exactly how much in converted in hindsight

sorry i did n't mean to knock your post   i do think you have valid points   i think it 's great to see discussions on the pros and cons on the vc start up world   my previous work experience was at a start up that made it big sold 90 to news corp at $ 400 mm valuation but was funded by angel investors so it was a different situation   i 'm currently getting my mba now so am looking at the space from both the vc perspective and the start up perspective   vcs can provide real value to start ups and they can also harm them   however no one is forcing the start ups to take vc money most do because it provides a higher probability for a faster path to success   the investment does n't come free obviously as you pointed out   the hours are horrible and you lose significant control   in many situations founders are taken away from the main leadership role   that does n't seem fair   however if someone sold the voting shares of their company they are opting in for that risk   the truth of the matter is that a lot of the people who are amazing at the ideas that birth the start ups are horrible at the day to day management   sometimes vcs step in and make the necessary changes to ensure the best chance at company profitability   is it fair yes   does it suck for the person ousted absolutely   it 's an oversimplification to say this is all bad or all good   it all depends on the situation   however yes there are vcs who are predatory and use their superior knowledge of how business financing and whatever else work to extract as much as they can from their portfolio companies   yet there are also some who honestly love the industry and want to help companies grow     your article 's stance is good because it prompts a discussion   however as i originally felt it does not do it as effectively as it could in my opinion   that 's awesome you got a ton of re tweets but as you say on your blog it 's about substance not the glitter and     edit voting do n't count as glitter and

a lot depends on whether your mortgage payments are interest only or repayment and what the remaining term is on each of the mortgages   either way i suspect that the best value for the money you put in will be had by making payments to the larger newer mortgage   this is because the quicker you reduce the capital owed the less interest you will pay over the whole term of the mortgage and you 've already had the older mortgage for sometime unless you so the benefit you can get from an arbitrary reduction in the capital is inevitably less than you will get from the same reduction in the capital of the newer mortgage   even if the two mortgages are the same age then the benefit of putting money into the one on the new house is greater due to the greater interest charged on it

money is money because people believe it is money by believe it is money i mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services food rent houses full of iron ore mining equipment at the spa helicopter rides ipads income streams to support your future retirement etc foreign exchange rates change because people 's ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change for example if the zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist you probably could n't use that money to buy as much food at the zimbabwe mart so you would n't be willing to give people as many us dollars which can buy food at the us mart for a zimbabwe dollar as you used to be able to it 's not exactly that easy because for instance food in the us is more useful to me than food in zimbabwe but people still move around all sorts of things like oil or agricultural products or minerals or electronics components the two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that it 's tied to how much stuff there is to get and how much of the currency there is how fast it 's moving around the economy which tells you how much money there is to get it with so most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in people 's expectations for a regional economy or the size of a money supply also zimbabwe is doing much better now that it 's their own currency they kept printing trillions of dollars worth and just trade in us dollars their economy still needs some work but better

many people have provided very good answers to this question and all the answers provide sound advice and justification below are some of my thoughts on the questions that you have put forward 1 the investment manager question the returns on your capital for a half year has been quite low having said that some investments do take more than half year to show some growth you could try talking to your investment manager and ask where your money has been deployed and why the returns are low if there are no real explanation given forth which would be more likely as you have mentioned your investment manager does not like to discuss your money with you you should pete 's advice and take all your money from investment manager and park it in the bank till you figure out what to do next with it 2 finances are not my forte at 22 finance is forte it takes longer than that however having said that how do you know finance is actually not your forte being a computer science graduate you would be more than comfortable with the mathematics required for finance you may not have looked seriously at finance till now i assume by your statement once way to be certain about this would be self learning some good books have been above and there are online information courses and articles on the internet for example here you could give some spare time and explore if finance interests you or not 3 if finance interests you then consider the 30 k as your seed fund and take a small portion of it say 2 k and try out your hand at investing on your own in the instruments that you feel most comfortable and see how you fare you are young enough to take the risk rest of the money you could put in other low risk instruments that you have identified through self study 4 if finance does not interest you the probably you are better off with an investment manager as observed above it will take some time for you to identify him her 5 on returns as mentioned above different instruments produce returns differently however one question that is universally asked is how much return on an one expect you were expecting more than $ 12 on your investment it is a difficult question to answer as returns and investment needs depend on a persons financial goals and risk taking profile one way to have some measure is to take 15 20 years cagr of the stock index return and reduce it by 2 3 that is in many cases not all a reasonable return expectation in medium long term

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

assuming united states rules may be wildly different elsewhere the family loan trick essentially lets you amortize a gift over multiple years of gift allowance and hopefully dodge gift tax at the cost of having to pay income tax on the interest you must charge on the loan the main advantage is that it lets you transfer all the money up front rather than in $ year per person per person chunks let 's take the normal case first any one person can give any one person up to a specified amount currently $ 17k i believe without incurring gift tax note that this is counted per person not per household you and your spouse could each give $ 17k per year to each of your son and his spouse under this rule adding up to $ per year total   the family loan dodge consists of making them a loan of the money at the mandated minimum interest rate to make it a legal loan something like 0.3 apr last time i looked setting the repayment schedule so their payments each year including interest come out to less than you can gift them with tax free and then making that gift by paying yourself those payments on their behalf you do need to pay income tax on the portion of those payments that represents interest income but at that low rate this is a minor cost for the convenience you 'd also want to set up your will to cover what happens if you die with them still owing money on the loan and this i believe is where you will really need expert advice if you go this route to minimize the government 's cut at that time there may be better answers if you are talking about this much money you owe it to yourself to purchase expert advice from someone who has training and experience n this area rather than taking free advice from the internet that is likely to cost you much more in the long run this is a situation where you ca n't afford not to hire a pro for example i have no idea how trusts might or might not fit your needs

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

no not deductible but if you work more than one job you run the risk of having too much ss withheld each employer does n't know what the others pays you tax time this   and much thanks to dilip for the following clarification not only does each employer not know what the others pays you but even if you tell him he will not care he is required to withhold social security tax on the wages he pays you and send in an equal amount as his contribution regardless of what anyone else pays you if the sum of your taxable wages from all employers exceed the maximum wages subject to social security the excess withholding is credited towards the income tax due and thus reduces the amount to be paid or increases the refund you are owed but the employer 's excess contribution that he sent in is not returned to him also there is no such things as excess medicare tax having been withheld because there is no maximum wage beyond which medicare tax does not apply

you 're getting paid by the job not by the hour so i do n't see why you think the employer is obligated to pay you for the drive time   the only way that might be true as far as i can see is if he were avoiding paying you minimum wage by structuring your employment this way   it looks like to me you 're over the minimum wage based on what you wrote   at maximum unpaid drive time 59 min each way and maximum length of job 4 hours as you stated it gives your minimum hourly rate of $ the federal minimum wage is currently $ so you 're over that   a quick search online suggests that nv does have a higher minimum at $ under some conditions but you 're still over that too the fact that you 're required to pick up the and that you have a company car at home probably does mean that you 're on the clock from the moment that you leave your house but again you 're not actually being paid by the clock   as long as no other law is being broken and it appears from your telling that there is n't then the employer can set any policy for how to compute the compensation that he wants regarding taxes the employer probably has no discretion there   you 're making what you 're making and the employer needs to tax it in total   since you 're driving a company vehicle from home i do n't think that you 're entitled to any reimbursement vs. wages that would not be taxed unless maybe you pay for gas yourself   the gas money if applicable should be reimbursable as a business expense and that generally would not be taxed

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

largely because stock markets are efficient markets at least mostly if not entirely while the efficient market hypothesis is not necessarily 100 correct for the majority of traders it 's unlikely that you could on the long term find significant market inefficiencies with the tools available to an individual of normal wealth say < $ 500k that 's what frequent trading intends to do find market inefficiencies   if the market is efficient then a stock is priced exactly at what it should be worth based on risk and future returns   if it is inefficient then you can make more money trading on that inefficiency versus simply holding it long   but in stating that a stock is inefficient you are stating that you know something the rest of the market does n't or some condition is different for you than the other million or so people in the market   that 's including a lot of folks who do this for a living and have very expensive modelling software and hardware to run it on   i like to think that i 'm smarter than the far majority of people but i 'm probably not the smartest guy in the room and i certainly do n't have that kind of equipment especially with high frequency trading nowadays as such it 's certainly possible to make a bit of money as a trader versus as a long term investor but on the whole it 's similar to playing poker for a living   if you 're smarter than most of the people in the room you might be able to make a bit of money but the overhead in the case of poker the money the house charges for the game in the case of stocks the exchange fees and broker commissions means that it 's a losing game for the group as a whole and not very many people can actually make money   add to that the computer based trading so imagine a poker game where four of the eight players are computer models that are really good and actively maintained by very smart traders and you can see where it gets to be very difficult to trade at a profit versus long term investments which take advantage of the growth in value in the company finally the risk because of leverage and option trading which is necessary to really take advantage of inefficiencies makes it not only hard to make a profit but easy to lose everything   again to the poker analogy the guys i 've known playing poker for a living do it by playing 10 20 games at once because one game is n't efficient enough you would n't make enough money   in poker you can do that fairly safely especially in limit games but in the market if you 're leveraging your money you risk losing a lot   every action you take to make it safer removes some of your profit

credit unions are mutually owned i.e. customer owned financial institutions that provide banking services   they take deposits from their members customers and loan them to other members   members vote on a board of directors who manage operations    they are considered not for profit but they pay interest on deposits   they get some preferential tax treatment and regulation and their deposits are insured by a separate organization if federally accredited   state chartered credit unions do n't have to maintain deposit insurance at all    their charters specify who can join   they can be based employer based or based on some other group with common interests   regulators restrict them so that they do n't interfere too much with banks   otherwise their preferential tax and regulatory treatment would leave banks uncompetitive    other organizations with similar limits have gone on to be competitive when the limits were released   for example there used to be an insurance company just for government employees the government employees insurance company   you may know it better as geico yes the one with the advertisements   now they offer life and auto insurance all over    credit unions would like looser limitations or no limitations at all but not enough to give up their preferential tax treatment   banks oppose looser limitations and have as much political clout as credit unions

many individual states counties and cities have their own income taxes payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes etc you will need to consult your state and local government websites for information about additional taxes that apply based on your locale wages salaries tips cash bonuses and other taxable employee pay strike benefits long term disability earnings from self employment earned income is subject to payroll taxes such as earned income is also subject to income taxes which are progressively higher depending on the amount earned minus tax credits exemptions and/or deductions depending on how you file there are 7 tax rates that get progressively larger as your income rises but only applies to the income in each bracket 10 for the first 2017 through 39.6 for any income above the full list of rates is in the above linked article about payroll taxes earned income is required for contributions to an ira you can not contribute more to an ira than you have earned in a given year interest ordinary dividends short term capital gains retirement income pensions distributions from tax deferred accounts social security unemployment benefits worker 's compensation alimony child support income earned while in prison non taxable military pay most rental income and s corp passthrough income ordinary income is taxed the same as earned income with the exception that social security taxes do not apply this is the pure taxable income referred to in the other linked question dividends paid by us corporations and qualified foreign corporations to stock holders that are held for a certain period of time before the dividend is paid are taxed at the long term capital gains rate explained below ordinary dividends like the interest earned in your bank account are included with ordinary income   stocks bonds real estate carried interest held for more than a year income from assets that increase in value while being held for over a year long term capital gains justified by the idea that they encourage people to hold stock and make long term investments rather than buying and then quickly reselling for a short term profit   the lower tax rates also reflect the fact that many of these assets are already taxed as they are appreciating in value real estate is usually taxed through local property taxes equity in us corporations realized by rising stock prices and dividends that are returned to stock holders reflect earnings from a corporation that are already taxed at the 35 corporate tax rate taxing capital gains as ordinary income would be a second tax on those same profits another problem with long term capital gains tax is that a big portion of the gains for assets held for multiple decades are not real gains inflation increases the price of assets held for longer periods but you are still taxed on the full gain even if it would be a loss when inflation is calculated capital gains are also taxed differently depending on your income level if you are in the 10 or 15 brackets then long term capital gains are assessed at 0 if you are in the 25 28 33 or 35 brackets they are assessed at 15 only those in the 39.6 bracket pay 20 capital assets sold at a profit held for less than a year income from buying and selling any assets such as real estate stock bonds etc that you hold for less than a year before selling after adding up all gains and losses during the year the net gain is taxed as ordinary income collectibles held for more than a year are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates

this has to do with the type of plan offered is it a 401(k plan or a profit sharing plan or both if it 's 401(k i believe the irs will see this distribution as elective and count towards the employee 's annual elective contribution limit if it 's profit sharing the distribution would be counted toward the employer 's portion of the limit however profit sharing plans have a formula that 's standard across the board and applied to all employees i.e. 3 of company profits given equally to all employees one of the benefits of the profit sharing plans is also that you can use a vesting schedule i 'd consult your accountant to see how this specifically impacts your business but in the case you describe this sounds like an elective deferral choice by an employee and i do n't see how or why you 'd make this decision for them give them the bonus and let them choose how it 's paid out edit in re reading your question it actually sounds like you 're wanting to setup a profit sharing type situation but again heed what i said above you decide the amount of profit but you also have to set an equation that applies across the board there is more complication to it than this brief explanation and i 'd consult your accountant to see how it applies in your situation

get a credit card is not the answer the reason people have a bad or no credit score is often because they 're new to the country have just turned 18 have previously fallen into arrears or are just bad with money getting a credit card is risky because if you do n't stay on top of your payments it 'll just damage your score even more   now it sounds like i hate credit cards but i do n't and they do have their benefits but avoid them if possible because they can be more hassle than they 're worth ie paying the credit back on time cancelling accounts when the interest comes in moving money in and out of accounts it 's risky borrowing money from anywhere whether it 's a payday lender a bank a credit card etc so use them as a last resort if you 've got your own income then that 's amazing try not to live outside of your means and your credit score will look after and increase itself it takes time to build a good credit score but always make sure you pay the people you owe on time and the full amount i 'd stick with paying your phone provider and any other direct debits you have setup and avoid getting a credit card i 'd recommend to keep track of your credit score and read their faq on how to help build it unlike experian it 's free forever so not quite as detailed but are owned by one of the biggest credit reference agencies in the uk so they should have the latest information on yourself in conclusion if you already have financial commitments like a mobile phone bill gym membership store cards anything that gets paid monthly by direct debit your credit score will increase provided you pay the full amount on time    i hope this helps ps i do n't work for any of the companies here but i 've been working in the finance sector more specifically short term loans for 3 + years now

i do n't have experience with tsp in particular but they look to be roughly the same as 401(k loans if the g fund rate is equal to the yield of government bonds then your main risk is the risk that yields increase which means the interest you 're paying is less than what you would have earned on the investments here are some other things to consider for any car loan i would borrow as little as possible with as short a term as possible   to me the interest savings and additional risks from borrowing from your retirement is n't worth it

you must mean the current debt ceiling debacle the meaning of it is us government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time such as social security checks bonds interest federal employees salaries and pensions etc by law total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped that means there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay say interest on existing bonds but can not since the limit is reached such situation is called a default since the government promised to pay the interest but is unable to do so that does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or could n't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by us government and with interest that is not very high though of course that may change it also does not mean the economy ceases to function dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt but if the government breaks its promises to investors it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future breaking promises to other people like social security recipients would also look bad and probably hurt many of them going back to your bank account most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in us treasury bonds which does n't really happen they still can be sold on the open market even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade so most probably your account would not be affected as stated in another answer even if the fallout of all these causes a bank to fail there 's fdic and if your money is under insured maximums you 'll be getting your money back but if your bank is one of the big ones nothing of the sort would happen anyway as we have seen in the past years government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures

in general currency has no expiration date specifically in canada the bank of canada has been issuing banknotes since and these are still considered legal tender even though they do n't look much like the modern banknotes   before that canadian chartered banks issued currency and these also still have value however there are a few things to note   first of all with currency of that age it often has more value as a collector 's item than the face value   so spending it at a store would be foolish second store clerks are not experts in old currency and will not accept a bill that they do not recognize   if you want the face value of your old currency you may need to exchange it for modern currency at a bank having said all that there are certainly cases where currency does expire   generally this happens when a country changes currency   for example when the euro was introduced the old currencies were discontinued   after a window of exchange the old currency in many cases lost its value   so if you have some old french franc notes for example they can no longer be exchanged for euros these types of events can not be predicted in the future of course so it is impossible to say when if ever the canadian currency you have today will lose its spending value in canada

my original plan was to wait for the next economic downturn and invest    in index funds these funds have historically yielded 6 7 annually    when entered at any given time but maybe around 8 9 annually when    entered during a recession these numbers have been adjusted for    inflation questions or comments on this strategy educate yourself as index funds are merely a strategy that could be applied to various asset classes such as us large cap value stocks emerging market stocks real estate investment trusts us health care stocks short term bonds and many other possibilities could you be more specific about which funds you meant as there is some great work by fama and french on the returns of various asset classes over time what about a roth ira mutual fund roth ira is a type of account and not an investment in itself so while i think it is a good idea to have roth ira i would highly advise researching the ins and outs of this before assuming you can invest in one you do realize that index funds are just a special type of mutual fund right it is also worth noting that there are a few kinds of mutual funds open end exchange traded and closed end which kind did you mean what should i do with my money until the market hits another    recession economies have recessions markets have ups and downs i 'd highly consider forming a real strategy rather than think oh let 's toss it into an index fund until i need the money as that seems like a recipe for disaster figure out what long term financial goals do you have in mind how ok are you with risk as if the market goes down for more than a few years straight are you ok with seeing those savings be cut in half or worse

they make money off you by increasing the spread you buy and sell your stocks through them   so for example if the normal spread for a stock was $ 10.00 for a buy and $ for a sell they might have a spread of $ 9.98 for the buy and $ for the sell so for an order of 1000 shares approx $ 10000 they would make $ 0.02 per share which would equal $ 20.00

that makes no sense at all they try to compare and that 's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges mortgage is long term loan so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20 or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower something around 6 heloc will have the interest rate of 6 but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage the bottom line is if helocs were that great noone would apply for mortgages you should stick to making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage

most emergencies are less than 1,000 in nature   as such i would keep at least that amount in a checking savings account at the bank from which you pay your bills or can get cash from   this amount may increase so you can avoid low balance fees or because of the nature of your life style and income beyond that you can search for yield   i personally like online savings accounts like amex personal savings ally or others    money market accounts will work equally well   there you can keep the bulk of your emergency savings and large purchase savings   keep in mind you still wo n't earn much   a 40 k emergency fund will only earn you $ at ally

i think you should evaluate the value of these so called penny auction websites very carefully   going to a random site .com which is british with uk prices but it works just the same with us prices they claim that someone has bought an ipod touch 64 gb for £ it is £ directly from apple sold for £ means there were bids i 'd have to log in to their site to find the cost of a bid for packages but you can multiply the cost of a single bid by add another £ and you 'll know what all bidders trying to receive this item paid i 'll bet the total is substantially more than £   people taking part in these scams obviously convince themselves that they are the clever ones who will get an item cheaply apart from the possibility that a single bidder can easily make more bids than the value of the item if you think you are more clever than everyone else you are kidding yourself if you think you are indeed more clever than everyone else go ahead and donate your money to these companies   the packages are most likely designed to give you the false impression that you get some value for money years ago when i checked a single bid was £ 1 but in bigger packages the bids would cost say 50 pence they also want many bidders to make sure the number of bids will be high although there is nothing other than the website 's honesty that prevents them from automatically adding bids if an item would otherwise sell too cheap   just to clarify these are not auction sites in an auction the highest bidder pays the price they bid usually plus some commission on ebay the commission is paid by the seller and gets the goods while everyone else keeps their money in this auction every bid costs money and by increasing the bid by one penny each time they make sure there are usually thousands of bids they also offer the products at a reduced price if you do n't win the auction the reduced price is substantially higher than buying from the manufacturer or any reputable retailer directly

there 's a huge difference between can an person make a profit on the stock market and can an average person get rich off the stock market it is certainly possible for an average person to profit but of course you are unlikely to profit as much as the big wall street guys   an s&p 500 index fund for instance would be a pretty good way to profit   people with high powered tools may make a lot of money picking individual stocks and may even make some choices that help them when the market is down but it 's difficult to see how they could consistently make money over the long term without the s&p 500 also going up   the same applies to varying to various other index funds etfs and mutual funds i agree with littleadv that there is no single right thing for everyone to do   my personal take is that index funds are a good bet and i 've seen a lot of people take that view on personal finance blogs etc for whatever that 's worth   one advantage of index funds that track major indexes like the s&p 500 is that because they are and are perceived as macro indicators of the overall economic situation at least you 're in the same boat as many other people   on one level that means that if you lose money a lot of other investors are also losing money and when large numbers of people start losing money that makes governments take action etc to turn things around   on another level the s&p 500 is a lot of big companies if it goes down some of those big companies are losing value and they will use their big company resources to gain value and if they succeed the index goes up again and you benefit in other words index funds and large mutual funds etfs etc make investing less about what day trading focus on which is trying to make a hot choice for a large gain   they make it more about your wagon to an extremely large star that is powered by all the resources of extremely large companies so that when those companies increase their value you gain   the bigger the pool of people whose fortunes rise and fall with your own the more you become part of an investment portfolio that is i ca n't resist saying it too big to fail   that is n't to say that the s&p 500 ca n't lose value from time to time but rather that if it does go down big and hard and stay there you probably have bigger problems than losing money in the stock market e.g. the us economy is collapsing and you should begin stockpiling bullets and canned food

an investment portfolio is typically divided into three components all three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or etfs a 401(k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one look at the prospectus for the expense ratio if it 's over 1 you 're definitely paying too much if it 's over 0.5 you 're probably paying too much if it 's less than 0.1 you have a really good deal us stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if it 's not invested for retirement international stocks are riskier than us stocks but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the us stocks bonds or fixed income investments are generally very safe but have limited opportunities for returns they tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly when you 've got a while to invest you should be looking at riskier investments when you do n't you should be looking for safer investments a quick and rough rule of thumb is that your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds so if you 're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so you should have about 50 in bonds roughly   people whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there because they already are at risk if it performs badly for instance if you work in the technology sector loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if there 's a big bust you 're not just out of a job your portfolio is dead as well more exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio while many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them

well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable it will be crazy if it truly does come to fruition if they fed treasury realize that they can not inflate their way out of this by printing more money and all of the nay of massive deflation get proven wrong    so the better question is this we believe know it 's coming so how do we prepare and strategically place ourselves to survive profit prosper from the coming collapse   as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    stocks will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    bonds are paying crap and after taxes barely inflation    for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    but for now where do we put our investments to protect and hopefully grow them as the mid term passes

the share price on its own has little relevance without looking at variations in your case if the stock went from 2.80 to you should care only about the 88 drop in value not what it means in pre split dollar values you are correct that you can un split to give you an idea of what would have been the dollar value but that should not give you any more information than the variation of 88 would as for your title question you should read the chart as if no split occurred as for most intents and purposes it should not affect stock price other than the obvious split

i think what he was confused about is why ev is used if a company like apple is going to have an ev much less than its market cap his point was if ev was the only way to measure the value of a firm a company that hordes cash like appl should be more valuable than its ev indicates    i think he failed to take into account that hording cash means the company is n't reinvesting in itself like it should and therefore at the time of a transaction when the cash exits the balance sheet you get significantly less in terms of remaining value    i can definitely see why people might get confused on ev though

gt;but on the bright side the most common decade for people to start saving is in their 20s twice as many 30 to 49 year olds said they started saving in their 20s instead of their 30s while the 50 to 64 age group was only slightly more likely to have started saving in their 20s over their 30s according to the report which adults living in the continental u.s.   so they are basing their analysis of how early people start saving purely by studying people in their 30s and 40s with those in their 50s and 60s they do n't compare either of those age groups with those in their 20s and 30s to see how things have changed

as says cfds are a derivative of the underlying stock in this case if you are from the usa then they are prohibited in the usa as has also been mentioned they are not prohibited however in many other countries including australia   we can buy or short sell on a limited number of securities cfds on australian securities usa securities and securities from many other countries on fx and different commodities the reason you are paying much less than the stock price is worth is because you are buying on margin when you go long you pay interest on overnight positions and when you go short you recieve interest on overnight positions that is if you hold the position open overnight most cfds are over the counter however in australia do n't know about other countries we also have exchange traded cfds called asx cfds i have tried both asx cfds and over the counter cfds and prefer the over the counter cfds because the broker provides a market which closely but not exactly follows the underlying prices the exchange traded cfds there was low liquidity due to being quite new so there was the potential to be gapped quite considerably this might improve as the market grows all in all once you understand how they work and what is involved in trading them they are much easier than options or however if you are going to trade anything first get yourself educated have a trading plan and risk management strategy and paper trade before putting real money on the table and remember if you are in the usa you are actually prohibited from trading cfds regarding the price of aapl at $ 50 the price should be the same as that of the underlying stock it is just that your initial outlay will be less than buying the stock directly because you are buying on margin your initial outlay may be as little as 5 or lower depending on the underlying stock

these scenarios discuss the period to 2025 they assess the deep uncertainty that is decision taking they identify the roots of this as the failure of the social model on which the west has operated since the related and pending problems imply that this situation is not recoverable without major change for example pensions shortfalls are greater in real terms that entire expenditure on world war ii and health care and age support will that due to the prolonged recession competition will impact complex industries earlier than expected   social responses which seek job protection the maintenance of welfare and also support in old age will tear at the social fabric of the industrial world there are ways to meet this implying a major change in approach and a characteristic way in which to fail to respond to it in time creating a dangerous and unstable world the need for such change will alter the social and commercial environment very considerably the absence of such change will alter it even more   the summary is available or at the foot of the link given in the the much richer paper is   these scenarios are the latest in a series in a project that dates back to 1995 over a hundred people participated from every continent over a six month period the working documents are available on the web

your approach sounds solid to me   alternatively if as appears to be the case then you might want to consider your tax advantaged accounts to tax inefficient investments such as reits and high yield bond funds   that way your investments that generate non capital gain i.e. tax expensive income are safe from the irs until retirement or forever   and your investments that generate only capital gains income are safe until you sell them and then they 're tax cheap anyway of course since there are n't really that many tax expensive investment vehicles especially not for a young person you may still have room in your retirement accounts after allocating all the money you feel comfortable putting into reits and junk bonds   in that case the article i linked above ranks investment types by tax efficiency so you can figure out the next best thing to put into your ira then the next etc

if you 're talking about a single stock you greatly underestimate the chances of it dropping even long term check out the 12 companies that made up the first dow jones industrial average in 1896 there is probably only one you 've heard of ge many of the others are long gone or have since been bought up by larger companies and remember these were 12 companies that were deemed to be the most representative of the stock market around the turn of the 20th century now if you 're talking about funds that hold many stocks up to thousands then your question is a little different over the long term 25 + years we have never experienced a period where the overall market lost value of course as you recognize the psychology of investors is a very important factor if the stock market loses half of its value in a year as it has done a few times people will be inundated with bad news and of this time it 's different and explanations of why the stock market will never recover perhaps this may be true some day but it never has been thus far so based on all the evidence we have if you hold a well diversified fund the chances of it going down long term again meaning 25 + years are basically zero

you 're right to seek passive income and since you 're already looking for it you probably already know some of the reasons to why it is important    do you live in the united states if so i 'd strongly recommend purchasing your primary residence and then maybe investment properties if you like owning your own home   the us tax and banking structure is set up to favor this move in more ways than i can count so save save save then beg borrow and steal to get the down payment rent rooms to friends or random people to afford the payments buy a fixer upper in an up and coming neighborhood   the us is rife with these in all price ranges if you 're working 56 hrs a week you 've got the work ethic so if you ca n't afford it it 's probably because you 're spending all your money on other stuff if you want to do this it will take some effort and savings you will have to trim back the vacations dinners out etc etc etc   let your friends do that stuff and rent from you   your life will get continually easier if you have already trimmed back all the discretionary spending and still ca n't make it then you need to earn more money doing either and both of these things will absolutely change your whole economic life and future so in summary i 'd offer these   ranked priorities 1 learn to save unless you always want to have to work for someone else 2 increase your income capability since your most valuable asset is you 3 buy and hold real estate because the game is rigged to favor passive income i 'm 38 never earned a six figure salary made some good purchases when i was 25 30 and work is optional for me now

you realise a capital gain as soon as you sell the stock at that point you will have to pay taxes on the profits when you fill in your tax return the fact that you used the money to subsequently purchase other stocks is not relevant unless you sell those stocks within the same tax year for example purchase $ 5000 of stock a in 2010 sell for $ 6000 in 2010 purchase $ 6000 of stock b in 2010 sell stock b for $ 6500 in 2010 purchase $ 6500 of stock c in 2010 sell stock c for $ 7000 in 2011 you owe capital gains on $ 6000 $ 5000 + $ 6500 $ 6000 = $ 1500 for tax year 2010 you owe capital gains on $ 7000 $ 6500 = $ 500 for 2011

there are two parts to this firstly if you are also living in the property you have bought then you should not consider it to be an investment you need it to provide shelter and the market value is irrelevant unless until you decide to move of course if your move is forced at a time not of your choosing then if the market value has dropped you might lose out no one can accurately predict the housing market any more than they can predict interest rates on normal savings accounts the movement of the stock market etc   secondly if you just have a lump sum and you want to invest it safely the bank is one of the safest places to keep it it is protected underwritten by eu law assuming you are in the eu up to € 100,000 see for example here which is about the uk and brexit in particular but mentions the eu blanket protection the other things you could do with it buy property gold art works stocks and shares whatever thing you think will be least likely to lose value over time would not be protected in the same way

gosh do n't do either   unless you are fully funding you roth accounts and even then i would n't do it   those interest rates are free money    you are giving away the best bargain in the history of home mortgages do n't you think you can make more than 4 on your money invested    do n't you think in 5 years you will be able to make 4 on bond and other low risk investments do n't forget money you pay in the 2020 's on beyond to your mortgage are inflationary dollars   do you think that money will be more valuable in the 20 's and beyond i do n't   roths are free money too   think if you put 11k in there a year how much would you have at the end of it tax free   there is a reason you can only put $ 5,500 in them they are too good a deal tax wise to let people put too much in there think about this my parents bought their home in 1967 their mortgage was $ 170 a month   inflation hits and the interest they are paying at 8 mind you it was still a laughable amount of money each month for mortgage payment from and on also i bought a $ 450,000 house 38 months ago   instead of putting down 180 i put down 80 i let the other 100k in my investment account and moved 5.5k over to roth every year i now have a roth worth $ 38k and an investment account worth $   i made 40k on my money those three years and the 38k is tax free if you do n't believe me call the help line at   get over the emotional need to be debt free and make a logical choice   i am begging you to think about this   this post could save you tens of thousands of dollars let me put it one more way   100k in debt with 100k in investments is debt free living   especially when you debt is under 4 and a tax write off

lots of good answers here about budgeting and other ideas   here 's a couple more think about offense and defense   offense is how much money you make   are you making enough to survive on   is there a way you could bring in more income   defense is what you do with your money   do you have expensive habits   do you have problems with impulse spending   do you live in an expensive area with a high cost of living   think about some of these areas and pick one to attack first if it is the defense side that is causing you problems you did mention trying to live on less consider reading your money or your life by joe and robin   there 's a really good summary of it on the authors site   the basic idea of the mechanical part of the book is that you figure out how much you 're truly making per hour and then evaluate your expenses based on how many hours of your life energy you are using for that expense   then you evaluate whether you think that 's a fair trade or not   there 's a lot more to it than that but it 's an interesting way to get a different perspective on your spending habits and may be enough to entice you to change those habits

many good answers here especially that you have to consider that renting may be more expensive than you 'd think also keep in mind that rent is money that is completely lost even if the property has dropped in value if you keep paying you will be able to recuperate part of your mortgage payments when you sell the house normally this is about + -30 but you need to calculate this yourself by dividing the expected sales price of the house by the total mortgage payments you have to make to pack back everything so i 'd say walking away only makes sense if the rents around where you want to live are much lower than < + -30 your mortgage payment and stable in of walking away immediately perhaps you can refinance your mortgage with a new one in 2008 the rates were around 5.8 now they are around 3.6 or so i do n't know how it goes in the usa but in my country if the rates drop it is relatively to do this and it can save people who refinance thousands if not more

it 's interesting that after reading this article you would make an assumption about where the stock market is headed this article specifically says that the only way to know that is to know where interest rates are going and for that we can guarantee no one knows    the takeaway is this the key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and above all the durability of that advantage the products or services that have wide sustainable around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors   intelligent investors should have no concern about what the market is doing analyze businesses not the stock market

there are several variables to consider taxes fees returns taxes come in two stages while adding money to the account you can save on state taxes if the account is linked to your state if you use an out of state 529 plan there is no tax savings keep in mind that other people such as grandparents can set aside money in the 529 plan $ 1500 a year with 6 state taxes saves you $ 90 in state taxes a year the second place it saves you taxes is that the earnings if they are used for educational purposes are tax free you do n't pay taxes on the gains during the 10 + years the account exists if those expenses meet the irs guidelines they will never be taxed   it does get tricky because you ca n't double dip on expenses a dollar from the 529 plan ca n't be used to pay for an expenses that will be claimed as part of the education tax credit how those rules will change in the next 18 years is unknown fees they are harder to guess what will happen over the decades as a whole 401(k programs have had to become more transparent regarding their fees i hope the same will be true for the state run 529 programs   returns one option in many all plans is an automatic change in risk as the child gets closer to college a newborn will be all stock a high school senior will be all bonds many all also allow you to opt out of the automatic risk shift though they will limit the number of times you can switch the option time horizon making a decision that will impact numbers 18 years from now is hard to gauge laws and rules may change the existence of tax breaks and their rules are hard to predict but one area you can consider is that if you move states you can roll over the money into a new account or create a second account in the new state to take advantage of the tax breaks there   there are also rules regarding transferring of funds to another person the impact of scholarships and attending schools like the service the tax breaks at deposit are important but the returns can be significant and the ability shelter them in the 529 is very important

the biggest risk you have when a country defaults on its currency is a major devaluation of the currency since the euro is a fiat currency like almost all developed nations its promise comes from the expectation that its union and system will endure the euro is a basket of countries and as such could probably handle bailing out countries or possibly letting some default on their sovereign debt without killing the euro itself a similar reality happens in the united states with some level of with state and municipal debt being considered riskier than federal debt it is n't uncommon for cities to default the biggest reason the euro will probably lose a lot of value initially is if any nation defaults there is n't a track record as to how the eu member body will respond will some countries attempt to break out of the eu if the member countries then the euro collapses rendering any and all euro notes useless it is that political stability that the value of the euro if you are seriously concerned about the risk of a falling euro and its long term stability then you 'd do best buying a hedge currency or a basket of hedge currencies to diversify risk many will recommend you buy gold or other precious metals but i think the idea is silly at best it is not only hard to buy precious metals at a fair value it is even harder to sell them at a fair value whatever currency you hold needs to be able to be used in transactions with ease does n't do you any good having $ 20 k in gold coins and no one willing to buy them as the seller at the store will usually want currency and not gold coins if you want to go the easy route you can follow the same line of reasoning central banks do buy usd and hold it it is probably the world 's safest currency to hold over a long period of time current us policy is inflationary so that wo n't help you gain value but that depends on how the eu responds to a sovereign debt crisis if one matures

another problem with this plan assuming you get past rocky 's answer somehow is that you assume that $ 50 k in construction costs will translate to $ 50 k in increased value that 's not always true the roi on home improvements is usually a lot less than 100 you 'd also owe more property taxes on your improvements which would cut into your plan somewhat but you also ca n't keep doing this forever soon enough you 'd run out of physical and/or legal space to keep adding additions to the house zoning tends to limit how much you can build unless you 're in the middle of nowhere and eventually you 'd fill the lot even if you did manage to keep obtaining more and more loans and you 'd quickly reach the point of diminishing returns on your expansions many homebuyers might be prepared to pay more for a third or fourth bedroom but vanishingly few in most markets will pay substantially more for a second room or a third home theater at some point your house is n't a mansion it 's that ridiculous castle only an eccentric would want and the pool of potential buyers and the price they 'll pay for it diminishes   and the lender not being stupid is n't going to go on financing your creation of a because they are the ones who will be stuck with the place if you default

while it is true that if the federal reserve bank makes a change in their rate there is not an immediate change in the other rates that impact consumers there is some between the federal rate and the costs of banks and other lenders regarding borrowing money of course the cost of borrowing money does impact the costs for businesses looking to expand which does impact their ability to hire more workers and expand capacity a change in business expansion does impact employment and unemployment then changes in employment can cause a change in raises which can cause changes in prices which is inflation plus the lenders that lend to business see the flow of new loans change as the employment outlook change   if the costs of doing business for the bank changes or the flow of loans change they do adjust the rates they pay depositors and the rates they charge borrowers how long it will take to change the cost of an auto loan no way to tell   keep in mind that in complex systems change can be delayed and wo n't move in lock step for example the price of does n't always move the same way a price of a barrel of oil does

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

if the share is listed on a stock exchange that creates liquidity and orderly sales with specialist market makers such as the nyse there will always be a counterparty to trade with though they will let the price rise or fall to meet other open interest   on other exchanges or in closely held or private equity scenarios this is not necessarily the case nasdaq has market maker firms that maintain the bid ask spread and can do the same thing with their own inventory as the specialists but are not required to by the brokerage rules as the nyse brokers are   the nyse has listing requirements of at least 1.1 million shares so there will not be a case with only 100 shares on this exchange

dividends telegraph that management has a longer term focus than just the end of quarter share price   there is a to at least maintain if not periodically increase the dividend payout year over year   management understands that cutting or dividends will cause dividend investors in market to dump shares driving down the stock price    dividends can have preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions either for an individual compared to capital gains or compared to the corporation paying taxes themselves   for example reits real estate investment trusts are a type of corporation that in order to not pay corporate income tax are required to pay out 95 of income as dividends each year   these are not the only type mlp master limited partnerships and other partnership structures will always have high dividend rates by design dividends provide cash flow and trade market volatility for actual cash   not every investor needs cash flow but for certain investors it reduces the risks of a liquidity crisis such as in retirement   the alternative for an investor who seeks to use the sale of shares would be to maintain a sufficient cash reserve for typical market recessions

security companies employing the same people who are currently police or military your property is your castle and you 'd only go to other properties that have rules that you consent to follow roads naturally would have the most lenient rules since their shareholders want as many normal people to use them as possible the difference from today is that the government sets up a monopoly of law that everyone must follow even though populations differ   rather than everyone fight to control the monopoly who sets up the rules we each have our own rules and competing security companies who may charge different prices based on what level of rule precision they must enforce such as a basic tier of policing violence theft higher tier for policing the sort of things that enforce today   basically if you want extra rules that are n't necessary and not very popular you pay for that in this way most people would be ok with not policing people who do behaviors such as casual or possession of dried plant life drugs   in this system trust and history matter a company who changed its name suddenly becomes brand new and therefore untested and with no history it must start at the bottom of the trust ladder brands are valuable precisely because they exhibit a history of the company you know 's cereal or toyota cars or apple computers are quality people regulate the market that 's the point the government is a monopoly so we customers do n't have control 1 vote every few years is much less than having 10 votes every day free market voting with our money

banks can not just borrow from the federal reserve and use that money to make loans the first thing you need to understand is how fractional reserve banking works the banks can make loans with money that their customers have deposited in their accounts the interest and fees from those loans go to pay the salaries of those working at the banks with leftover profit to pay dividends interest on your bank accounts   the only reason that the federal reserve allows overnight lending is so that banks do n't immediately become insolvent if they have larger than usual withdrawals by their depositors the federal reserve keeps an eye on the balance sheets of the banks that are doing the borrowing and if they did n't have assets in the form of deposits they would force the banks to sell the loans that were made from those deposits what does this have to do with personal finance i think this question is only marginally on topic here this amount of money in circulation is affected specifically by the fraction of the money that can be used for making other loans but the bigger influence is the rate that the federal reserve charges for overnight lending they raise and lower the rates which affects the rates that the banks can lend at while remaining profitable

the value of coins currency is more of demand vs supply situation the value of coins is not just due to it being old but also    for example the us nickel around 300,000 were minted the us nickel around 400,000 were minted   however the nickel is at more premium than the this is because there are many collectors who want to complete the collection post 1900 they can never complete the 1800 to 1900 collection as other year coins are not available    it is hard to tell which currency will catch craze amongst collectors that 's what will drive the prize for example if 50 years from now zimbabwe becomes a leading developed country there will be craze nostalgia to collect things of past    certain coins like the american double eagle are a craze because the design is very good its made of gold has history to it it 's sold for usd 7 8 million or the usd 1 dollar sheets 16 notes in a sheet the sheet goes for around 1 2 million usd as an individual if you have some coins currencies keep them more as a hobby than as something that would return value    investments in collectibles and art is an emerging form of investment and needs to be looked at separately and should n't be mixed with a simple hobby

if you get an inr 1000 discount for paying up front versus paying over six months you can consider that inr 1000 interest your annualized rate comes out to about if you can earn better than on that money by using it elsewhere in the mean time then you should pay over six months if not you should pay the whole price up front you may also elect to pay the interest if you do not have the full amount now but the use of the phone for the next six months will earn you more than the inr 1000 premium that you pay to defer the full purchase price

i doubt that it is possible to keep something like this secret from your husband forever if you get away with it once i 'd guess you 'll probably try it again and sooner or later he 'll find out he 'll notice that things show up in the house that are n't accounted for in the budget or he 'll see a statement from your secret bank account or one of your friends will say something about it when he 's around etc i found out about some of my ex wife 's secret finances when she was n't home one day i got the mail and found a credit card bill for an account i knew nothing about if the on the question are that you 're not going to tell him the truth and you 're not going to get a divorce i think the only realistic answer is that there is no way of keeping this secret with a high probability of success

i would say minimal price differences   stores will need to remain and the difference if any will likely be to cover the cost of the transaction that visa and other card companies charge them

car rental agencies typically accept only credit cards for the rental you can pay at the end with debit but the securing during the rental must be a credit card or a high cash deposit hotel advance bookings even if many months in the future will work fine with a credit card but as explained by others on a debit card it would directly affect your cash flow you basically have to prepay instead of just leave the credit card number on file the same is sometimes true for other advance booking like cruises tours etc
